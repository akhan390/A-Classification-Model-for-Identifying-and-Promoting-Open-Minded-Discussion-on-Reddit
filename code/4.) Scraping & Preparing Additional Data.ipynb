       "      <td>I used to be pro-choice, but a recent incident made me think deeper about the principles of pro-choice and pro-life and their consequences and I can now say I am fully pro-life. This probably won’t change, but I‘m willing to change my view on any of the listed arguments below (given someone can actually convince me).\\n\\nThe backstory: so an acquaintance of mine, she’s a 21 y/o woman, decided she wanted to have a family with her BF(24) of 5 years a few weeks ago. Naturally they were having completely unprotected sex and trying really hard to procreate. It all worked out and she became pregnant. After 4 weeks of being pregnant she decided to abort the child because quote on quote now with what’s happening in the world the time’s not really right to have a child.\\n\\nNormally I don’t really care about other people’s business, but this got me really mad and also got me to realize what’s wrong with pro-choice and that it should not be your choice, nor your right to take another human beings life, unless it wasn’t your choice to conceive to begin with. I also don’t think you should have a right to abortion if conception is due to carelessness. This also includes relying on birth control that fails, because birth control is known to be unreliable and any mean of protection isn’t meant as a guarantee, that’s why doctors even recommend to combine different means of protection. \\n\\nUnless you were raped, you should bot have the right to abort, that’s my view. \\n\\nEdit: Another instance of where you should be able to abort a child is when you yourself wouldn’t survive giving birth.\\n\\nI also want to go over some pro-choice arguments I frequently hear which honestly are more than dumb in my opinion:\\n\\n1.) What if she’s too young and can’t afford it? The child will ruin her life!\\n\\nThis is especially untrue in a socialist country, since part of the higher taxes gets used to support mothers. As for America: that’s something the US is piss poor in, supporting mothers who are not part of the work force. BUT normally someone who’s young and becomes pregnant is not alone. You still have your family and in most cases the father of the child‘s family. If the father wants nothing to do with the child you can still file for child support even in young ages, it‘ll just be the father’s family who‘ll have to pay and not him directly. Of course having a child at a young age comes with a lot of sacrifices regarding lifestyle, but with the support of your family you can still pursue your education and build up a career. AND even if there is noone there to help you (which is quite unrealistic to begin with) you can still put the child up for adoption.\\n\\n2.) Adoption is not a good option, the child might end up in a bad family and be unhappy\\n\\nThe child also might end up in a great family and being alive and unhappy still is better than ending up as a dead pulp in a bucket.\\n\\n3.) It is not even a human at the point of abortion, just a lump of cells and does not live\\n\\nSperm is a living cell and so is a follicle. It is alive from the very beginning, just not conscious. From the 5-7th week on this lump of cells already has a heartbeat and I became witness to that when I was at an ultrasound with my GF‘s sister. Apart from that, it being a lump of cells now doesn’t make it less of a living organism, nor does it change the fact that it will ultimately become a human. A living, breathing, conscious, feeling organism. \\n\\n4.) It is her body and her choice what she does with it\\n\\nWhile you can do whatever you want with YOUR body, you shouldn’t be able to decide what happens with the living organism inside you. If everyone should have the right to do what they want with their body, why shouldn’t the fetus have exactly that right too? The fetus might not be conscious yet, but it legally has human rights already. One of those being the right to live and be free of bodily harm. Don’t want to believe me? Then tell me what happens if somebody was to kick a pregnant woman in the stomach and cause her child to die? Right, they would be convicted based on killing the child (nasciturus in front of the law). How is one a choice and the other murder?\\n\\n5.) pregnancy is a very tough time and it sucks and can have lasting effects on a woman‘s body (teeth, hair, skin, joints, etc.)\\n\\nIt is ~9 months compared to a whole life you are taking away. 9 months for a life. Putting 9 months of having a shitty time over a whole life is nothing short of selfish in my opinion, especially regarding that most, if not all of the pains and discomforts of pregnancy are either preventable or curable.</td>\n",

The narrative is generally well thought-out and well executed. They tell a clear story and are generally considered intentional on some level. \\n\\nAbstract painting (from what I understand at least) seems to lump the responsibility of the narrative onto the viewer. I don’t view this as a necessarily bad thing in context, but I don’t believe it’s necessarily difficult either. \\n\\nIn my eyes, giving too much (or in some cases *any*) credit to the abstract artist would be similar to giving a basketball to a kid and telling him to invent a sport and then taking the credit for the invention of the sport.</td>\n",

Since this is an entirely faith-based issue, I would not like to get into argument regarding this.\\n\\nMy main focus is that I see people often pointing out five points of defence for the goodness and necessity of religion. However, I believe all of these benefits are irrelevant in a modern world, and will only do more harm than good to future generations. \\n\\nTherefore, my position is that from the perspective of leaving a better world for our children, we should work to abolish religion as quickly as possible.\\n\\n**1/ Religious people do charity?**\\n\\nPeople argue that churches should be praised for their charity efforts. \\n\\nHowever, all kinds of social groups do charity. My high school class has organised volunteer trips to help out people in flooded regions. My sports club often donates to food banks. There is an open facebook group in my local area consisting of volunteers who pick up trash. \\n\\nDoing good is not exclusive to religious groups, and there is absolutely no reason why you *have* to go to a church to contribute.\\n\\nFurthermore, there are *so many* non-profit organisations that do a far more effective and efficient job at charity than churches. There are even sites like [charitywatch.org](https://charitywatch.org) that lists out hundreds of worthy charities. I would so much rather future generations donate to these deserving organisations than to churches.\\n\\n**2/ Religion brings people a sense of community?**\\n\\nAgain, people come together for all kinds of reasons. Do we *really* need a made-up fairy tale that reeks of delusion to being people, especially our children, together? I would so much rather see my children socialise out of a genuine hobby that they are passionate or a social cause that they actually care about.\\n\\n**3/ Religion gives us beautiful architecture?**\\n\\nThis is a subjective matter. I find modern architecture stunning and beautiful. I find those old grandiose churches more of a gaudy eye-sore than anything. Churches should serve as nothing more than artifacts of a darker time for future generation to visit and appreciate the past.\\n\\n**4/ Religion gives people peace of mind?**\\n\\nEverybody has a different path to inner peace. Even something as dumb as a placebo drug can calm the patient. Many people choose to come to terms with their own mortality to find inner peace.\\n\\nI would not like to see my children find peace through a thousands-year old text that tells them to live their life in constant fear and submission to an imaginary god. Even religions like Buddhism who tout the concept of zen and peace base their philosophy on feels-good theories than on proven scientific understanding. \\n\\nInstead, I would much rather my children understand the realities of existence, the smallness of humans the the limits of our scientific understanding, and accept it for what it is.\\n\\n**5/ Religion makes us moral?**\\n\\nThis point has been argued to death. You do not need religion to be an upstanding, moral, and empathetic person. If anything, it can be argued that religious people do good out of selfish desires not to go to hell rather than out of a genuine sense of care for others.\\n\\nI would like a world where empathy, compassion, and common sense act as the guiding principles for my children's morals. I would not like to see my children basing their moral compass off an ancient text filled with violence and absurdities that tell them that people who are slightly different than them will be burnt in eternity.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nReligion is irrelevant and unnecessary at best, and detrimental at worst. It takes us away from true human compassion and leads us into a path of illogical delusion. Per my five counter-arguments above, I believe there is absolutely no compelling reason why we should even consider preserving this anachronistic tradition. The disappearance of religion would bring about a better world for future generations. \\n\\nPlease change my view.</td>\n",

       "0  I used to be pro-choice, but a recent incident made me think deeper about the principles of pro-choice and pro-life and their consequences and I can now say I am fully pro-life. This probably won’t change, but I‘m willing to change my view on any of the listed arguments below (given someone can actually convince me).\\n\\nThe backstory: so an acquaintance of mine, she’s a 21 y/o woman, decided she wanted to have a family with her BF(24) of 5 years a few weeks ago. Naturally they were having completely unprotected sex and trying really hard to procreate. It all worked out and she became pregnant. After 4 weeks of being pregnant she decided to abort the child because quote on quote now with what’s happening in the world the time’s not really right to have a child.\\n\\nNormally I don’t really care about other people’s business, but this got me really mad and also got me to realize what’s wrong with pro-choice and that it should not be your choice, nor your right to take another human beings life, unless it wasn’t your choice to conceive to begin with. I also don’t think you should have a right to abortion if conception is due to carelessness. This also includes relying on birth control that fails, because birth control is known to be unreliable and any mean of protection isn’t meant as a guarantee, that’s why doctors even recommend to combine different means of protection. \\n\\nUnless you were raped, you should bot have the right to abort, that’s my view. \\n\\nEdit: Another instance of where you should be able to abort a child is when you yourself wouldn’t survive giving birth.\\n\\nI also want to go over some pro-choice arguments I frequently hear which honestly are more than dumb in my opinion:\\n\\n1.) What if she’s too young and can’t afford it? The child will ruin her life!\\n\\nThis is especially untrue in a socialist country, since part of the higher taxes gets used to support mothers. As for America: that’s something the US is piss poor in, supporting mothers who are not part of the work force. BUT normally someone who’s young and becomes pregnant is not alone. You still have your family and in most cases the father of the child‘s family. If the father wants nothing to do with the child you can still file for child support even in young ages, it‘ll just be the father’s family who‘ll have to pay and not him directly. Of course having a child at a young age comes with a lot of sacrifices regarding lifestyle, but with the support of your family you can still pursue your education and build up a career. AND even if there is noone there to help you (which is quite unrealistic to begin with) you can still put the child up for adoption.\\n\\n2.) Adoption is not a good option, the child might end up in a bad family and be unhappy\\n\\nThe child also might end up in a great family and being alive and unhappy still is better than ending up as a dead pulp in a bucket.\\n\\n3.) It is not even a human at the point of abortion, just a lump of cells and does not live\\n\\nSperm is a living cell and so is a follicle. It is alive from the very beginning, just not conscious. From the 5-7th week on this lump of cells already has a heartbeat and I became witness to that when I was at an ultrasound with my GF‘s sister. Apart from that, it being a lump of cells now doesn’t make it less of a living organism, nor does it change the fact that it will ultimately become a human. A living, breathing, conscious, feeling organism. \\n\\n4.) It is her body and her choice what she does with it\\n\\nWhile you can do whatever you want with YOUR body, you shouldn’t be able to decide what happens with the living organism inside you. If everyone should have the right to do what they want with their body, why shouldn’t the fetus have exactly that right too? The fetus might not be conscious yet, but it legally has human rights already. One of those being the right to live and be free of bodily harm. Don’t want to believe me? Then tell me what happens if somebody was to kick a pregnant woman in the stomach and cause her child to die? Right, they would be convicted based on killing the child (nasciturus in front of the law). How is one a choice and the other murder?\\n\\n5.) pregnancy is a very tough time and it sucks and can have lasting effects on a woman‘s body (teeth, hair, skin, joints, etc.)\\n\\nIt is ~9 months compared to a whole life you are taking away. 9 months for a life. Putting 9 months of having a shitty time over a whole life is nothing short of selfish in my opinion, especially regarding that most, if not all of the pains and discomforts of pregnancy are either preventable or curable.  \n",
       "1  1.\\tThe main reason why people think retard is offensive is because it was used to classify a mental disability. “Mental Retardation”. The thing is, it’s not used by the medical community anymore. It’s been phased out because of Obama and the Rosa’s Law\\n2.\\tOther words that were used as mental disabilities and phased out are very commonplace. Idiot, imbecile, and moron are very G rated words and they have been used to classify intellectual disabilities in the past, and they have been phased out in several stages.\\n3.\\tWith a combination of the first two reasons, retard shouldn’t have the negative connotations it has today. There are movements to make people stop saying it, and it’s honestly not a slur. I don’t think a person has an intellectual disability if I call him retarded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "2  Okay okay, I’m aware that it’s cliché to critique abstract painting as indistinguishable from elementary school refrigerator masterpieces but hear me out...\\n\\nPost-Impressionism, surrealism, realism, pop art, and photorealism all seem to have some practice and skill correlated with their relative success and transcendence. The narrative is generally well thought-out and well executed. They tell a clear story and are generally considered intentional on some level. \\n\\nAbstract painting (from what I understand at least) seems to lump the responsibility of the narrative onto the viewer. I don’t view this as a necessarily bad thing in context, but I don’t believe it’s necessarily difficult either. \\n\\nIn my eyes, giving too much (or in some cases *any*) credit to the abstract artist would be similar to giving a basketball to a kid and telling him to invent a sport and then taking the credit for the invention of the sport.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "3  After working a lot on lynching through social media and on lynching IRL (still happening on some countries), I have come to develop this rather fiscal opinion.\\n\\nQuick nuance: I’m not talking about shaming companies or governments or organizations. They don’t listen nor change until they’re targeted by outrage.\\n\\nI’m talking specifically about individuals. People that can be destroyed by the shaming (losing a job, a reputation, their life...), without any form of due process. \\n\\nEven if someone (apparently) « deserves it », the punishment has not proper limitation, especially when social media get involved in the shaming. Where not talking about shaming the local creep in a small village anymore...\\n\\nIf I were to exaggerate a bit, I would say that my case against public shaming share similarities with the case against the death penalty: the severity of the punishment creates a new imbalance in society. The punished are sacrificed because we can’t think of a better deterrent.\\n\\nThanks for any answers, looking forward to the nuances!\\n\\nEDIT: I’ve been ask to clarify so here it is! The behavior I find inacceptable would be the act of attacking someone (for something they are, said or did) with the intent of hurting them in a public setting (IRL or digital). \\n\\n« You disgust me, I hope you lose your job you piece of shit!

       "4  The most obvious issue with religion is that it is nothing more than man-made fairy tales invented to comfort and control the masses before the advent of science. Since this is an entirely faith-based issue, I would not like to get into argument regarding this.\\n\\nMy main focus is that I see people often pointing out five points of defence for the goodness and necessity of religion. However, I believe all of these benefits are irrelevant in a modern world, and will only do more harm than good to future generations. \\n\\nTherefore, my position is that from the perspective of leaving a better world for our children, we should work to abolish religion as quickly as possible.\\n\\n**1/ Religious people do charity?**\\n\\nPeople argue that churches should be praised for their charity efforts. \\n\\nHowever, all kinds of social groups do charity. My high school class has organised volunteer trips to help out people in flooded regions. My sports club often donates to food banks. There is an open facebook group in my local area consisting of volunteers who pick up trash. \\n\\nDoing good is not exclusive to religious groups, and there is absolutely no reason why you *have* to go to a church to contribute.\\n\\nFurthermore, there are *so many* non-profit organisations that do a far more effective and efficient job at charity than churches. There are even sites like [charitywatch.org](https://charitywatch.org) that lists out hundreds of worthy charities. I would so much rather future generations donate to these deserving organisations than to churches.\\n\\n**2/ Religion brings people a sense of community?**\\n\\nAgain, people come together for all kinds of reasons. Do we *really* need a made-up fairy tale that reeks of delusion to being people, especially our children, together? I would so much rather see my children socialise out of a genuine hobby that they are passionate or a social cause that they actually care about.\\n\\n**3/ Religion gives us beautiful architecture?**\\n\\nThis is a subjective matter. I find modern architecture stunning and beautiful. I find those old grandiose churches more of a gaudy eye-sore than anything. Churches should serve as nothing more than artifacts of a darker time for future generation to visit and appreciate the past.\\n\\n**4/ Religion gives people peace of mind?**\\n\\nEverybody has a different path to inner peace. Even something as dumb as a placebo drug can calm the patient. Many people choose to come to terms with their own mortality to find inner peace.\\n\\nI would not like to see my children find peace through a thousands-year old text that tells them to live their life in constant fear and submission to an imaginary god. Even religions like Buddhism who tout the concept of zen and peace base their philosophy on feels-good theories than on proven scientific understanding. \\n\\nInstead, I would much rather my children understand the realities of existence, the smallness of humans the the limits of our scientific understanding, and accept it for what it is.\\n\\n**5/ Religion makes us moral?**\\n\\nThis point has been argued to death. You do not need religion to be an upstanding, moral, and empathetic person. If anything, it can be argued that religious people do good out of selfish desires not to go to hell rather than out of a genuine sense of care for others.\\n\\nI would like a world where empathy, compassion, and common sense act as the guiding principles for my children's morals. I would not like to see my children basing their moral compass off an ancient text filled with violence and absurdities that tell them that people who are slightly different than them will be burnt in eternity.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nReligion is irrelevant and unnecessary at best, and detrimental at worst. It takes us away from true human compassion and leads us into a path of illogical delusion. Per my five counter-arguments above, I believe there is absolutely no compelling reason why we should even consider preserving this anachronistic tradition. The disappearance of religion would bring about a better world for future generations. \\n\\nPlease change my view.

You can pick more than one thing\\nYou could do a group costume and your own costume, one that’s more modest and one that’s more exposed, etc etc\\n\\n2. Not as expensive as you think\\n\\nThe costumes can be as simple as you like if that’s your thing, you’re probably just pulling stuff out of the closet and getting one or two accessories.\\n\\nWhat would this look like? Here’s my plan\\n\\n1. The main costume: this is the costume you’d wear on the big night or a very special occasion.\\n\\n2. The reclusive costume: This is a less elaborate costume. It works best with costume parties but also if you don’t wanna draw attention on yourself. For example if you’re taking your kids out for a halloween event you want people to focus on their costumes, not yours. Some obvious good choices/accessories are witches, vampire teeth, devil horns, zombie face paint+a occupation, anything creative but not flashy.\\n\\n3. The not a costume costume: This isn’t technically a costume but it is vital as hell. A normal outfit that embodies Halloween. This can be a scary sweater, witch earrings, or simply be a color scheme. The reason that it’s so vital is because of two possibilities. Firstly, not everyone wants to be dressed up for a whole ass day- for me I want to be dressed up outside but then crash at a friends place for a movie- so a comfortable outfit is great! Secondly, if you live somewhere with unpredictable weather or temperatures - it’ll help keep you cozy! \\n\\nI know i care a lot about this Holiday so many people might not agree- but let’s plan our holiday better!!</td>\n",

       "4  One costume just isn’t enough. I think that there are so many benefits to having multiple costumes.\\n\\n1. You can pick more than one thing\\nYou could do a group costume and your own costume, one that’s more modest and one that’s more exposed, etc etc\\n\\n2. Not as expensive as you think\\n\\nThe costumes can be as simple as you like if that’s your thing, you’re probably just pulling stuff out of the closet and getting one or two accessories.\\n\\nWhat would this look like? Here’s my plan\\n\\n1. The main costume: this is the costume you’d wear on the big night or a very special occasion.\\n\\n2. The reclusive costume: This is a less elaborate costume. It works best with costume parties but also if you don’t wanna draw attention on yourself. For example if you’re taking your kids out for a halloween event you want people to focus on their costumes, not yours. Some obvious good choices/accessories are witches, vampire teeth, devil horns, zombie face paint+a occupation, anything creative but not flashy.\\n\\n3. The not a costume costume: This isn’t technically a costume but it is vital as hell. A normal outfit that embodies Halloween. This can be a scary sweater, witch earrings, or simply be a color scheme. The reason that it’s so vital is because of two possibilities. Firstly, not everyone wants to be dressed up for a whole ass day- for me I want to be dressed up outside but then crash at a friends place for a movie- so a comfortable outfit is great! Secondly, if you live somewhere with unpredictable weather or temperatures - it’ll help keep you cozy! \\n\\nI know i care a lot about this Holiday so many people might not agree- but let’s plan our holiday better!!   \n",

From the designers to the embroiderers, each worker was US based and paid a fair wage. Initially,  I was very proud to know my dollar wasn't supporting cruelty to someone else,  like some random sweatshop worker in some developing country, but the more I think about it, the more I think this wasn't a necessarily beneficial decision.\\n\\nThe reason these companies are able to exploit workers so terribly is because the workers have no better options.They pick on people with no other prospects and offer them table scraps for the labor they provide. But if we boycott them, the product demand decreases, and fewer manufacturing jobs would be offered in the first place. Then they would be even worse off.\\n \\nOne example of this would be [Apple](https://youtu.be/5ItLIywwepY), which treats workers so badly that they install nets that prevent suicide (instead of actually improving conditions). Would avoiding iPhones help them at all?\\n\\nI think if these companies were boycotted on a large scale, of course that could be effective at waking them up. They wouldn't want to lose money.  But what can an individual do that might actually be beneficial? \\n\\nI don't know much about economics or how many of these industries work. I'm looking forward to responses that change my view.</td>\n",

It's slightly liberal (aka spicy centrist). There are no ideals displayed through reddits censorship. What appears on the front page of Reddit seem to stand for temporary situations instead of pushing an ideology.\\n\\nFor example, one day you'll see a major company getting tons of slack and private and enterprise getting absolutely bashed and the next day some company will sue some poorly though of politician or donate some money and all the anti corporate sentiment will be forgotten and suddenly that one companies actions will be praised.\\n\\nThis is just an example both because true leftists would never praise a company for anything because they are all shit and because it shows how specific reddits censorship is.\\n\\n\\nAside from reddits wishy washyness, when they do settle on anything for a while it's almost always a very liberal movement. For example, Reddit clearly pushes the BLM ideology along but none of the videos of protestors being brutally and inhumanely beating or otherwise injured by police make it to the popular section of Reddit.\\n\\nThere are countless examples of this but my point is Reddit isn't far left it's barely left and it's just liberal. You can't find a single leftist post on the popular page if you checked everyday for years.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hello, I am pro-choice with regards to abortion, but I disagree with the more mainstream view that only the woman should get to decide. My view is that an abortion should need both parents' consent rather than only the mother, with a few exceptions, which are in cases of rape, when the fetus is unviable, when the mother's life is in danger, when the identity of the father is unknown, and maybe a few other extraneous cases I can't think of.\\n\\nFirst, the most common argument against my point is that women are the ones who have to deal with pregnancy (+ all the bodily changes), and thus it should be up to them. I disagree with this point because it seems to presume that pregnancy is the most defining part about having a kid, which I think is very untrue. The 18+ years of parenting, which the father does alongside the mother, way outweighs the importance of bodily changes in my opinion.\\n\\nGoing along with the last argument, I refute the idea of \"my body, my choice,\" because the body in question is the child's, not the mother's (unless her life is in danger). While I agree that cases in which the mother's life is threatened should be up to her, if that is not the case, the mother's say should be about the same as the father's as they each make up half of the kid's blood.\\n\\nMy other problem with it is that it reinforces the stereotype that the mother is more important than the father. In society, there is a bias to motherhood over fatherhood. Many believe that a child's relationships will always and should always be stronger with their mother than their father. I think the same bias that gives women better odds in custody battles influences the debate about abortion. Some kids have closer relationships with their moms, and some their fathers, we shouldn't presume one or the other.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: To clairfy, because the first two responses here are both asking, I believe there needs to be consensus to get an abortion. If no consensus is reached, baby is born (save for the same circumstances I specified above).\\n\\nEdit 2: I've been convinced. Someone mentioned the alternative of just letting the father opt out of the responsibilities of being one if they don't want to have the kid and while it isn't a perfect solution (I feel that there is none for this situation), it checks the most boxes possible for me. But you can debate me on that point if you want.</td>\n",

       "0  This is a view I'd really like to have changed, because I would like to believe that I have some amount of power as a consumer. \\n\\nA few weeks ago, I bought a shirt from from a company that was super transparent about their entire manufacturing process. From the designers to the embroiderers, each worker was US based and paid a fair wage. Initially,  I was very proud to know my dollar wasn't supporting cruelty to someone else,  like some random sweatshop worker in some developing country, but the more I think about it, the more I think this wasn't a necessarily beneficial decision.\\n\\nThe reason these companies are able to exploit workers so terribly is because the workers have no better options.They pick on people with no other prospects and offer them table scraps for the labor they provide. But if we boycott them, the product demand decreases, and fewer manufacturing jobs would be offered in the first place. Then they would be even worse off.\\n \\nOne example of this would be [Apple](https://youtu.be/5ItLIywwepY), which treats workers so badly that they install nets that prevent suicide (instead of actually improving conditions). Would avoiding iPhones help them at all?\\n\\nI think if these companies were boycotted on a large scale, of course that could be effective at waking them up. They wouldn't want to lose money.  But what can an individual do that might actually be beneficial? \\n\\nI don't know much about economics or how many of these industries work. I'm looking forward to responses that change my view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "1  I hear people constantly go on and on about how far left Reddit is, and as an actual leftists (libertarian socialist) I have to disagree.\\n\\nThe front page of Reddit really isn't left. It's slightly liberal (aka spicy centrist). There are no ideals displayed through reddits censorship. What appears on the front page of Reddit seem to stand for temporary situations instead of pushing an ideology.\\n\\nFor example, one day you'll see a major company getting tons of slack and private and enterprise getting absolutely bashed and the next day some company will sue some poorly though of politician or donate some money and all the anti corporate sentiment will be forgotten and suddenly that one companies actions will be praised.\\n\\nThis is just an example both because true leftists would never praise a company for anything because they are all shit and because it shows how specific reddits censorship is.\\n\\n\\nAside from reddits wishy washyness, when they do settle on anything for a while it's almost always a very liberal movement. For example, Reddit clearly pushes the BLM ideology along but none of the videos of protestors being brutally and inhumanely beating or otherwise injured by police make it to the popular section of Reddit.\\n\\nThere are countless examples of this but my point is Reddit isn't far left it's barely left and it's just liberal. You can't find a single leftist post on the popular page if you checked everyday for years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "2   I am seeing messages deleted by mods or operators of social media websites. They should face the same treatment. The French authorities should track anyone in their country that posts anything in support of the tragedy, and do the same thing they did to all of the Muslims. If any of them were Evangelical Christian Pastors or went to a Catholic church, those should be investigated as well.  It is beyond comprehension that they would target supporters of one attack and not the other. That shows that the government is picking favorites among the population. They need to show they are even handed. They need to show solidarity.

       "4  Hello, I am pro-choice with regards to abortion, but I disagree with the more mainstream view that only the woman should get to decide. My view is that an abortion should need both parents' consent rather than only the mother, with a few exceptions, which are in cases of rape, when the fetus is unviable, when the mother's life is in danger, when the identity of the father is unknown, and maybe a few other extraneous cases I can't think of.\\n\\nFirst, the most common argument against my point is that women are the ones who have to deal with pregnancy (+ all the bodily changes), and thus it should be up to them. I disagree with this point because it seems to presume that pregnancy is the most defining part about having a kid, which I think is very untrue. The 18+ years of parenting, which the father does alongside the mother, way outweighs the importance of bodily changes in my opinion.\\n\\nGoing along with the last argument, I refute the idea of \"my body, my choice,\" because the body in question is the child's, not the mother's (unless her life is in danger). While I agree that cases in which the mother's life is threatened should be up to her, if that is not the case, the mother's say should be about the same as the father's as they each make up half of the kid's blood.\\n\\nMy other problem with it is that it reinforces the stereotype that the mother is more important than the father. In society, there is a bias to motherhood over fatherhood. Many believe that a child's relationships will always and should always be stronger with their mother than their father. I think the same bias that gives women better odds in custody battles influences the debate about abortion. Some kids have closer relationships with their moms, and some their fathers, we shouldn't presume one or the other.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: To clairfy, because the first two responses here are both asking, I believe there needs to be consensus to get an abortion. If no consensus is reached, baby is born (save for the same circumstances I specified above).\\n\\nEdit 2: I've been convinced. Someone mentioned the alternative of just letting the father opt out of the responsibilities of being one if they don't want to have the kid and while it isn't a perfect solution (I feel that there is none for this situation), it checks the most boxes possible for me. But you can debate me on that point if you want.   \n",

From the designers to the embroiderers, each worker was US based and paid a fair wage. Initially,  I was very proud to know my dollar wasn't supporting cruelty to someone else,  like some random sweatshop worker in some developing country, but the more I think about it, the more I think this wasn't a necessarily beneficial decision.\\n\\nThe reason these companies are able to exploit workers so terribly is because the workers have no better options.They pick on people with no other prospects and offer them table scraps for the labor they provide. But if we boycott them, the product demand decreases, and fewer manufacturing jobs would be offered in the first place. Then they would be even worse off.\\n \\nOne example of this would be [Apple](https://youtu.be/5ItLIywwepY), which treats workers so badly that they install nets that prevent suicide (instead of actually improving conditions). Would avoiding iPhones help them at all?\\n\\nI think if these companies were boycotted on a large scale, of course that could be effective at waking them up. They wouldn't want to lose money.  But what can an individual do that might actually be beneficial? \\n\\nI don't know much about economics or how many of these industries work. I'm looking forward to responses that change my view.</td>\n",

It's slightly liberal (aka spicy centrist). There are no ideals displayed through reddits censorship. What appears on the front page of Reddit seem to stand for temporary situations instead of pushing an ideology.\\n\\nFor example, one day you'll see a major company getting tons of slack and private and enterprise getting absolutely bashed and the next day some company will sue some poorly though of politician or donate some money and all the anti corporate sentiment will be forgotten and suddenly that one companies actions will be praised.\\n\\nThis is just an example both because true leftists would never praise a company for anything because they are all shit and because it shows how specific reddits censorship is.\\n\\n\\nAside from reddits wishy washyness, when they do settle on anything for a while it's almost always a very liberal movement. For example, Reddit clearly pushes the BLM ideology along but none of the videos of protestors being brutally and inhumanely beating or otherwise injured by police make it to the popular section of Reddit.\\n\\nThere are countless examples of this but my point is Reddit isn't far left it's barely left and it's just liberal. You can't find a single leftist post on the popular page if you checked everyday for years.</td>\n",

Initially,  I was very proud to know my dollar wasn't supporting cruelty to someone else,  like some random sweatshop worker in some developing country, but the more I think about it, the more I think this wasn't a necessarily beneficial decision.\\n\\nThe reason these companies are able to exploit workers so terribly is because the workers have no better options.They pick on people with no other prospects and offer them table scraps for the labor they provide. But if we boycott them, the product demand decreases, and fewer manufacturing jobs would be offered in the first place. Then they would be even worse off.\\n \\nOne example of this would be [Apple](https://youtu.be/5ItLIywwepY), which treats workers so badly that they install nets that prevent suicide (instead of actually improving conditions). Would avoiding iPhones help them at all?\\n\\nI think if these companies were boycotted on a large scale, of course that could be effective at waking them up. They wouldn't want to lose money.  But what can an individual do that might actually be beneficial? \\n\\nI don't know much about economics or how many of these industries work. I'm looking forward to responses that change my view.   \n",
       "1  I hear people constantly go on and on about how far left Reddit is, and as an actual leftists (libertarian socialist) I have to disagree.\\n\\nThe front page of Reddit really isn't left. It's slightly liberal (aka spicy centrist). There are no ideals displayed through reddits censorship. What appears on the front page of Reddit seem to stand for temporary situations instead of pushing an ideology.\\n\\nFor example, one day you'll see a major company getting tons of slack and private and enterprise getting absolutely bashed and the next day some company will sue some poorly though of politician or donate some money and all the anti corporate sentiment will be forgotten and suddenly that one companies actions will be praised.\\n\\nThis is just an example both because true leftists would never praise a company for anything because they are all shit and because it shows how specific reddits censorship is.\\n\\n\\nAside from reddits wishy washyness, when they do settle on anything for a while it's almost always a very liberal movement. For example, Reddit clearly pushes the BLM ideology along but none of the videos of protestors being brutally and inhumanely beating or otherwise injured by police make it to the popular section of Reddit.\\n\\nThere are countless examples of this but my point is Reddit isn't far left it's barely left and it's just liberal. You can't find a single leftist post on the popular page if you checked everyday for years.                                                                                       \n",
       "2   I am seeing messages deleted by mods or operators of social media websites. They should face the same treatment. The French authorities should track anyone in their country that posts anything in support of the tragedy, and do the same thing they did to all of the Muslims. If any of them were Evangelical Christian Pastors or went to a Catholic church, those should be investigated as well.  It is beyond comprehension that they would target supporters of one attack and not the other. That shows that the government is picking favorites among the population. They need to show they are even handed. They need to show solidarity. Unite the people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "0  this is a view id really like to have changed because i would like to believe that i have some amount of power as a consumer  few weeks ago i bought a shirt from from a company that was super transparent about their entire manufacturing process from the designers to the embroiderers each worker was us based and paid a fair wage initially  i was very proud to know my dollar wasnt supporting cruelty to someone else  like some random sweatshop worker in some developing country but the more i think about it the more i think this wasnt a necessarily beneficial decision reason these companies are able to exploit workers so terribly is because the workers have no better optionsthey pick on people with no other prospects and offer them table scraps for the labor they provide but if we boycott them the product demand decreases and fewer manufacturing jobs would be offered in the first place then they would be even worse off\\n \\none example of this would be apple which treats workers so badly that they install nets that prevent suicide instead of actually improving conditions would avoiding iphones help them at all think if these companies were boycotted on a large scale of course that could be effective at waking them up they wouldnt want to lose money  but what can an individual do that might actually be beneficial  dont know much about economics or how many of these industries work im looking forward to responses that change my view                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "4  hello i am prochoice with regards to abortion but i disagree with the more mainstream view that only the woman should get to decide my view is that an abortion should need both parents consent rather than only the mother with a few exceptions which are in cases of rape when the fetus is unviable when the mothers life is in danger when the identity of the father is unknown and maybe a few other extraneous cases i cant think of the most common argument against my point is that women are the ones who have to deal with pregnancy  all the bodily changes and thus it should be up to them i disagree with this point because it seems to presume that pregnancy is the most defining part about having a kid which i think is very untrue the 18 years of parenting which the father does alongside the mother way outweighs the importance of bodily changes in my opinion along with the last argument i refute the idea of my body my choice because the body in question is the childs not the mothers unless her life is in danger while i agree that cases in which the mothers life is threatened should be up to her if that is not the case the mothers say should be about the same as the fathers as they each make up half of the kids blood other problem with it is that it reinforces the stereotype that the mother is more important than the father in society there is a bias to motherhood over fatherhood many believe that a childs relationships will always and should always be stronger with their mother than their father i think the same bias that gives women better odds in custody battles influences the debate about abortion some kids have closer relationships with their moms and some their fathers we shouldnt presume one or the other to clairfy because the first two responses here are both asking i believe there needs to be consensus to get an abortion if no consensus is reached baby is born save for the same circumstances i specified above 2 ive been convinced someone mentioned the alternative of just letting the father opt out of the responsibilities of being one if they dont want to have the kid and while it isnt a perfect solution i feel that there is none for this situation it checks the most boxes possible for me but you can debate me on that point if you want   \n",

       "0  cmv boycotting companies that exploit workers has no practical benefit this is a view id really like to have changed because i would like to believe that i have some amount of power as a consumer  few weeks ago i bought a shirt from from a company that was super transparent about their entire manufacturing process from the designers to the embroiderers each worker was us based and paid a fair wage initially  i was very proud to know my dollar wasnt supporting cruelty to someone else  like some random sweatshop worker in some developing country but the more i think about it the more i think this wasnt a necessarily beneficial decision reason these companies are able to exploit workers so terribly is because the workers have no better optionsthey pick on people with no other prospects and offer them table scraps for the labor they provide but if we boycott them the product demand decreases and fewer manufacturing jobs would be offered in the first place then they would be even worse off\\n \\none example of this would be apple which treats workers so badly that they install nets that prevent suicide instead of actually improving conditions would avoiding iphones help them at all think if these companies were boycotted on a large scale of course that could be effective at waking them up they wouldnt want to lose money  but what can an individual do that might actually be beneficial  dont know much about economics or how many of these industries work im looking forward to responses that change my view  "
