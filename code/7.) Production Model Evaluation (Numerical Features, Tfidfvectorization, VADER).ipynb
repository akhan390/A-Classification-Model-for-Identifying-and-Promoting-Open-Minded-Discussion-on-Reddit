especially when compared to european and scandinavian nations only exception being if you have money andor influential connections cue long list of stats and sources removing references to the global youknowwhat that ends in  i feel that our response to that situation is worth discussing but the automod suppressed the original post and i dont feel those points are integral to the overall view for the purposes of this sub i believe this are not the most free  are number  in incarceration both total and per capita here being convicted of a felony takes away your right to vote us is th in press freedom my view has been thoroughly changed on this i recognize the ranking isn’t legitimate but lets also not forget that in the recent blm protests police were arresting journalists and attacked people for recording them from private property the most democratic are actually th have a massive wealth gap in our country   of americans live under the poverty line and almost  of americans can’t afford an unexpected  expense us has a gini coefficient measurement of wealth inequality of  with a coefficient of  meaning almost complete wealth inequality also have one of the highest homeless populations is only truly accessible by the rich  health care spending per person in the us hit  in  and is predicted to be  by  explains why over  of bankruptcy filings in the us are due to medicalrelated expenses even just getting to the hospital in an ambulance here can cost you thousands we are not a healthy country  are number  in the world for obesity with over  of our population obese by far the highest ranking western country edit  there are  million people in the us who live in food deserts which is why i consider this a failing of the country rather than personal choices us consistently has more deaths from treatable diseases than comparable countries uk canada france australia etc education is only accessible to those with money  cost of higher education ranges from k to k compared to virtually nothing in other western nations this means higher education either burdens us students with a lifetime of debt or keeps all but the wealthiest from attending us is st in the world in reading math and science with  of top us performers registering as wealthy while only  as poor or disadvantaged when it comes to raising a child need a ton of money for that too due to lack of free child care and no federal family leave policy and that link shows alabama probably one of the cheapest states to live in in the whole country the police in response to police brutality police around the country responded with unprecedented violence going as far as to run protesters over with cars and shoot people who aren’t even protesting on their porches they specifically targeted journalists trying to report on the situation nations around the world have condemned the us response to what have been by and large peaceful protests many americans are still very dumb that only  of american adults think that the measles vaccine which has been around in some form since the ’s is safe that’s almost  million americans who are either unsure of its safety or think it’s unsafe aka southern states get textbooks edited to portray the civil war as being about states rights not about slavery many of those same southern states have as little as  of students with high school diplomas american dream is more achievable outside the us than inside here is a link to the raw data which i cant possibly get through but in case anyone disagreed with the article for things that have become partisan for some reason roe v wade being a bipartisan decision by the supreme court republicans still campaign on stacking the court and directing them to overturn the decision not only taking away a womans right to seek an abortion but grossly overstepping the separation of the executive and judicial branches all because of religious values has outright said he wont fund the post office so he can disrupt mailin voting a clear attack on a basic democratic principle and this was after he tweeted about wanting to delay the election even if it was a red herring to distract from the disastrous economic numbers mcconnell also refused to consider the stimulus bill due to the usps funding further screwing over average americans dont get me started on mcconnell the man who has basically made it his lifes work breaking our democracy most famous of which being when he blocked obamas legitimate supreme court nomination just on principle elect bigoted people to represent our bigoted populous trump also gave rush limbaugh the presidential medal of freedom despite his bigoted remarks deny climate change and our government is destroying the environment for the sake of helping corporate interests most of the country the gay panic defense is a legal justification for killing an lgbtq person and conversion therapy is legal in most areas as well just a few examples of the deeply rooted homophobia in this country number  in gun violence but large swaths of the country still prefer that to any form of gun control sure im forgetting one stat or another but i feel like its been covered pretty sufficiently is america the worst country in the world no im not going as extreme as to say we live in a rd world country but by the standards of other developed nations the us lags far behind in almost every aspect i can think of americans who don’t have money or aren’t willing to go into crippling debt because god forbid you want healthcare or to be educated you’re basically screwed and would almost certainly be better off living somewhere in western europe or scandinavia instead change my view like i should put a disclaimer that i am going by the numbers i have lived a comfortable life here as im sure many others have but my argument is also that if you have lived a comfortable life here either that indicates some level of wealthpower andor that your quality of life would still be better in a europeanscandinavian country my view  felt that i should include that our federal minimum wage is only k a year above the poverty line and unable to support a person living anywhere in the country   since i keep getting the same points repeated to me over and over again ill just address them here since i just got the notification this hit the front page i definitely wont be able to address even most of these comments at this point but ill do my best i made about homelessness  i know that made no sense you can stop bringing it up the people who are telling me that i cant compare the us to european countries  i awarded a delta for someone who pointed out that it would be better to look at the eu as a whole however i dont think its a legitimate argument to entirely write off comparing the us to individual countries since while we may have a massive population and gdp to match our per capita gdp isnt that much higher than the countries im comparing it to to reiterate again i am not arguing that it is impossible to achieve a good life here in the us or that were a rd world country maybe you or your great grandparents immigrated here and made a good life for yourselves and thats great but overall the us is not the best in terms of economic opportunity like i addressed in the op',\n",

alike so long as the vehicular occupant is not being disruptive or breaking other laws update  stop sending me bloody threats or your opinions through private message  received a message and i quote if you want people to sleep in cars so bad why dont we have them all park outside your house so they can sell drugs in your property rpe your daughters murder your spouse and leech off the government but pin it all on your hands you dont need to verbally assault someone for an opinion on any matter in the world if you want to debate this comment on the threat im declining all pms about the issue here on out  ive had a field day replying to all of you guys ive changed my opinion a fair bit its a difficult topic on one hand morally speaking i want to be able to make it easier for people to get off the street but to make it legal to sleep in a typical car there are so many things that have to be taken into consideration legal changes new regulation taxation sanitary conditions ive decided to retract my statement and change my opinion that it should be legal to sleep in any vehicle however i add this sleeping in regulationconforming vehicles ie vans trucks minivans that have adequate space are kept sanitary can generate electricity are livable should be legal and permitted sleeping in an everyday civic or another car that is not designated for sleeping permanently should not be allowed except in the following circumstancesa the person can not get home safely and just needs to sleep for a short period of time or the person is under the influence of substances and feels unsafe operating their vehicle and cannot get other accommodation or rideshare so they sleep in their vehicle outside of a bar party location etcb the person is in a domestic or violent situation where it is unsafe for them to return homec the person is camping in a campsite which shouldnt be an issue with the topic of this post at all and chooses to sleep in their vehicled the persons who are sleeping in the vehicle are travelling and it is not a permanent situationall of the aforementioned conditions would make it absolutely legal to sleep in your vehicle\\n if there was to be a provision made in the future to allow sleeping in vehicles and allow vehicles to be considered a property a property tax should be instated on it that way taxpaying homeowners do not feel disadvantageda in a sense the registation fee of a vehicle and the other monthly costs could be considered a property tax but i know it wouldnt make everyone happy a tax of living in the vehicle would make sense but then again would it its the best common ground\\n sleeping in a vehicle in the same location for more than  hours should be disallowed to ensure people do not reside in one location and block traffic or begin to claim territory as their own occupants would be required to move their vehicle throughout city streets if this does not happen their vehicle will be towed after warnings this in mind if you choose to comment on my post any further i will read replies but i am struggling to keep up with all of them i didnt expect this to go viral it was mostly a rant but you guys changed my mind and i appreciate that i didnt think it would happen when i made this post but it sure has  im going to go ahead and continue replying to everyone who shares their thoughts or opinion but i do want to say that my opinion has definitely been altered i still stand adamant that it should not be illegal especially in the cases which the person residing in their vehicle is not homeless but has income and can afford insurance a license and is not in a condition that they are unfit to drive though there must be regulation and potentially taxation especially in urban areas and large cities thanks to everyone who replied and thank you for those who are reading this i appreciate you all fail to grasp any logic behind big cities banning people from sleeping in vehicles they own instead of living in a permanent house of all its expensive as hell to live in a house it can cost month or greater to rent a small apartment in a big city such as san diego about  minutes away from where i live it is extremely taxing on those who are struggling with minimum wage or low paying jobs and makes it much more difficult for homeless persons to get out of their situation it would be much more cost effective and much easier for those who are struggling to survive if they were to get a van or use a vehicle and live in that what would be  a month could be cut into a  or  monthly payment whos living alone may not want a house in my situation im currently saving up for a van in order to live on the road while i work from my mobile home this is great for me i love travel dont have a lot of possessions and am a very simplistic person its a much cheaper much more enjoyable experience and the fact that i may have to be careful not to visit certain cities or wander too far into town during the night to park my vehicle always worries me a bit about my future if someone chooses to live in their car so long as the conditions are livable ie no moldleaking oilsome kind of air circulating in the vehicle there should be no legal issue with that much safer for someone to pull off in their vehicle than it is to continue driving while tired i remember one time i was driving down the freeway and i was just too tired to continue knowing that if i pulled off to sleep i would be woken up and told to leave by a leo i continued driving i actually fell asleep for brief  seconds moments at the wheel each one i jerked awake the minute i started to feel my car moving out of my lane it was scary and i wouldve much rather been able to legally pull off into a neighborhood or a city street and sleep for the night would love someone to educate me as to why this is illegal i struggle to find justifiable reasons as to why someone would not be allowed to sleep or even live out of their car anything that would normally require an address or established residence can easily be made up for such as a laundromat rather than an in home machine a po box a cell phone instead of a landline using public facilities instead of a personal toilet vans can be rigged with electricity the car produces electricity if needed through an inverter that can be plugged into the port in the dash and without a doubt its safer than sleeping on the street sleeping can be done discretely without being a disturbance and without the public even noticing or being affected it seems to me like the perfect way for someone who may not make  a month but closer to  a month to be able to save while still having a guaranteed place to sleep',\n",

hard to see supporting it as anything other than a shrewd political ploy here are my main reasons for supporting a popular vote rather than the ec in general popular sovereignty is good  it should take very powerful considerations to take elections out of the hands of the people  i dont feel the need to argue for a popular vote system because its so clearly the best option for a nation that claims to be democratic you can say the whole republicdemocracy thing and i superduper dont care i know we are a republic  i passed high school civics  we could have a popular vote system that chooses the executive and still be a republic  the ec is almost a popular vote system the way it operates now  its given the same result as a popular vote system  of the time  the times that it hasnt have been random close elections\\n one person one vote is a valuable principle and we should strive to live up to it  simple arithmetic can show that a voter in wyoming has around  times more influence on the ec than a voter in california  this wouldnt be true if it wasnt for the appropriations act in the s which capped the number of people in the house of representatives at   in the ec as it was designed california would have many more electoral votes now and the gap between wyoming and cali wouldnt be nearly as large\\n there is no fundamental value in giving rural america an outsized say in elections  ive often heard that the ec was created to protect rural interests  this isnt true but even if it was i dont see the value in giving small states more influence  this is where i developed the idea that most of the arguments are in bad faith  particularly because the current kind of inequality we have now in the ec was never intended by the founders   if you are supporting the ec just because it favors rural areas and you also know rural areas tend to vote red then you just have that position for partisan reasons\\n the elector system is very dumb and bad  do we really want  people that weve never heard of to get the ability to overturn an election  this isnt a group of able statesmen the electors are largely partisan figures  in most states you dont even see that you are voting for an elector instead of for a candidate for president  these are elected officials only in the most vague sense of the term  the idea that this ceremonial body is some kind of safeguard is laughable\\n the concept of swing states is bad for democracy  focusing on groups of swing voters in  states leads to undue attention and money being used to persuade smaller groups of voters it also creates a sense of votes being worthless i was a democrat in a deep red state for a long time and it felt like my vote didnt matter because my state was going to go red anyway  and thats going to be true for most voters apart from the  swing states that are uncertain on election day  its hard to know if that is pushing turnout down but it certainly isnt having a positive effect\\n the ec makes elections less secure  instead of a popular vote system where it would take a hue effort to change enough votes to make a difference rigging state elections in swing states could have a huge impact  the targets for interference are clear wisconsin michigan arizona north carolina and florida could be changed with relatively small numbers of votes  this also makes voter suppression a tactic that can work on a national scale if applied in the correct states  i need to get to my actual workjob instead of rageposting about the electoral college ive enjoyed reading everyones responses and appreciate your participation some final responses to some underlying points ive seen lots of people saying i just hate the ec because of trump i have literally hated the electoral college since i learned about it in the th grade for me this isnt fully partisan i absolutely would still be against the electoral college if a democrat won the ec and a republican won the popular vote i know you may im lying and i grant that this isnt something i can really prove but its true feel free to hold me to it if that ever happens my position is currently and always has been the person who gets more votes should be president\\n the historic context of the electoral college while important to understanding the institution has an outsized influence on how we talk about presidential elections i would much rather look forward to a better system than opine about how wise the system set up in  was the founders were smart smarter than me but we have  years of hindsight of how this system practically works which is very valuable\\n i was wrong to say all defenses of the ec were bad faith or partisan i see that now i still believe a portion of defenses are but there are exceptions the fact that most discussions of the ec happen just after a close election give all discussions surrounding the issue a hyperpartisan tone but that doesnt have to be the rule\\n if you think farmers are worth more to the country because theyre farmers i have some news to you about who was doing the farming in  it wasnt the voters i can tell you that much\\n im sorry if i appeared brusque or unappreciative of your comments this thread got way more attention than i expected im rereading my responses now and theres absolutely some wording choices id change but i was in a hurry you all have a good day abolish the electoral college be gay do crime etc',\n",

       " 'cmv the sexual assault accusations against biden are a big deal i cant see why the accusations against biden are any less significant and they are perhaps worse than the accusations against kavanaugh it seems this reality and the timing of the accusations or at least the recent escalation of the accusations are so challenging that the left is not really dealing with them yet or has decided not to deal with them  instead going into circle the wagons mode  so when i say big deal i mean this is something not being discussed much in the left that could lead to a biden losing the election b biden somehow being replaced with another dem  c a last minute third party candidate steps in and gains favorability eg mark cuban  or all of the above  im interested to hear why i have this wrong and why it really isnt that big of a big deal  or if in agreement with my view   what can or should be done at this late stage for those whod prefer not to have trump win by default  ideally it would be great to avoid a lot of i told you so comments since im not arguing a position about who should or shouldnt have been nominated well that escalated quickly  hanks for all of the great comments the analysis and debate among cmvers is so much better than you can get anywhere else i probably owe a few more deltas when i get more time here’s a summary of some highlights so far paraphrasing in italics is different area of this argument that i think is interesting and that i hadn’t thought about urgency  there was an urgency to scrutinize bk’s background none of us knew who bk was rightly or wrongly then suddenly he’s up for a lifetime appointment with gop fasttracking on the back of the merrick garland shenanigan so even to a nonpartisan the need to evaluate ford’s claims and the media’s handling of the issue as something that needed to be urgently discussed seems more reasonable in contrast to biden’s long career in the spotlight and gradual ramping towards president  in general i can give democrats some credit for not having an ideal situation to set the standards for how to look into allegations given that handling the matter in a diligent and measured way was not really an option at the time  holding the media and democrats to the standards set by bkgate true left is treating this as a big deal view on this was partially motivated by the fact that bernie endorsed biden after the allegations were known so while there may be a strong reaction in some sectors of the left the reaction is either not a big deal or it hasn’t been “processed” yet by at least one person on the left who matters in my view witness isn’t credible because of recent behavior completely agree that the accuser may not be credible and commenters pointed at many good issues to look at that said the nyt reported there are ish people who corroborate to varying degrees that something did happen in the early ’s this undermines the idea that the story was recently fabricated  even if the decision to publicize now is dubious i credit the nyt and others for reporting this but the degree to which they are covering her story vs the circumstantial evidence against her credibility seems disproportionate given past precedent i suspect that has to do with the media being under a great deal of scrutiny to defend why they didn’t report on the matter more proactively sooner until proven guilty this view seems to be held by conservatives and liberals the metoo movement has put forward the idea that the conventional methods that we use to determine someone’s guilt or innocence have failed women ie crosby weinstein and these methods need to adapt to take into consideration the power dynamic between accusers and perpetrators the dynamic explains why a victim might continue to have a cordial public relationship with a perpetrator when this type of thing might have formerly have proven a perpetrator ‘not guilty’ whether you agree with this line of thinking on not my assertion is that this belief is held by a large enough number of democrats and that it creates a problem with no easy answers in the biden case  not compare biden to trump guess i should explain that i dont think most voters are comparing trump to biden  most voters these days are either in one camp or the other  the right does not seem to care much about sexual misconduct unless it involves a figure that they can use as an example of hypocrisy of the left clinton weinstein etc so i dont think trumps history is that relevant to what i mean by a big deal ie something that could influence the election  it just doesnt really matter what trump does at this point  if he could shoot someone at park avenue and get away with it imagine what he could do to a woman the left does care about it  the bk scandal is symbolic of the standard that the left has set to deal with partiallycorroborated accusations of sexual misconduct from the past against a powerful figure being considered for a high political office so thats why it is relevant in my analysis  looks like reades mother may have corroborated her story in the s removing another pillar in the reade is a politically motivated hack narrative   i cant reply to every individual post on this but it seems to underscore the misguidedness of assuming ford is automatically credible while reade must be held to a different standard',\n",

       " 'cmv waving the confederate flag is more disrespectful to the american flag than kneeling during the national anthem this post probably isn’t for people who don’t think kneeling is disrespectful to the flag to begin with but i feel there is a portion of the us population in the south that is adamant that you must stand for the national anthem but are also partial to displaying the confederate flag the argument about what kneeling is really about has probably been in numerous other posts some still believe it’s an insult to the american flag as well as the us military despite it being made clear the protest is not about the flag or the military people still think that performing the protest during the anthem and while the flag is specifically on display is disrespectful regardless of the intention this regard any display of the confederate flag other than in a completely unambiguously historical context is far more disrespectful to the american flag than kneeling is flying the confederate flag as a source of pride even if it’s just pride of your own ancestry is demonstrating that you are proud of a side that fought against what the current flag stands for now it’s not to be confused with a state flag or anything like that it’s a flag that specifically represents a way of life that the current flag is against don’t necessarily want this to turn into an argument that the confederate flag isn’t about slavery my case is that the confederate flag clearly represents a time when the country was divided and the confederate side lost so still flying a confederate flag shows a continued act of divisiveness towards other americans when the argument is that the american flag is a sign of unity it would be similar to claiming you’re flying the union jack flag to show american patriotism the union jack and confederate flag both represent losing sides of attempts to make america into something different than what it is now so any claim to have pride in those flags is not american pride or patriotism which is indirect conflict with true american patriotism and therefore disrespectful to the idea of what the american flag represents mentioned above i’m perfectly fine with anything being represented in an historical context history is crucial and required for education but there’s a pretty clear distinction between historical representation and what i’m talking about so i’d rather not use this post to debate historical relevance that if you think kneeling is disrespectful to the american flag then you should also think flying the confederate flag is disrespectful to the american flag and even more so',\n",

       " 'cmv wap by cardi b and megan thee stalion is not an anthem of female empowerment and is instead just sinking to the same lows that maleproduced hiphop has been criticized for for years edit right so ive been at it on and off for like hrs at this point gonna call it a wrap for the night thanks for the awesome conversation thanks for the awards thanks to the mods for all their ongoing hard work keeping this thread clean and thanks to those who shifted my view if youre looking to get in on the discussion id recommend jumping in on an existing chain rather than leaving a top level comment as im pretty swamped and cant promise a reply also if you think im a racist or a sexist id love to hear some specifics on why you think that got a lot of accusations along those lines but they were invariably short on the details when asked ill try to get back in the am thanks all not a lot of dog in this fight im not a huge hiphop or rap fan these days and what i do listen to is fairly underground  far from the poppy variant of this song i just became aware of this debate and thought id chime in with my view here also add a large part of why im so selective about the hiphop i do listen to is because more than any other genre it is prone to making incredibly crass and demeaning statements about women or hosting an unhealthy obsession over sex without love as well as drug use violence and all sorts of unhealthy harmful and negative themes more than any other genres hip hop and rap are an absolute minefield of misogyny and all sorts of other shitty behaviors something they have been criticized for for a long time color me surprised when a song comes out made by women in the industry and follows all those same negative demeaning sexist tropes and is for some reason folks hail it as the epitome of female empowerment or claim apparently without a trace of irony or satire that surely the epitome of modern feminism is women rapping about the selflubricating prowess of their vaginas mean what the fuck guys i encourage you to review the lyrics of the song as well as the music video and ask yourself if these are signs of female empowerment or good things generally some various themes the song touches on it refers to women as whores\\n it seems largely based on the idea of being proud of a well lubricated vagina something many women struggle with\\n it glorifies sugar babygold digger culture in which women trade sex for money or gifts\\n it seems to promote unprotected either from pregnancy or stds sex\\n it preferences tight vaginas and large penises which seems to be a form of body shaming both men and women who dont conform to these ideals\\n it demeans men who engage in certain sexual acts with women\\n it seems to shame women who might prefer a more traditional role in relationships or a more traditional view of sex\\n it presents women and female body parts as sex objects on and on and on various people promoting this track as the epitome of female empowerment  nay  the epitome of all of modern feminism seem to be painfully unaware that their own promotion of frankly cringingly sexist drivel is the reason why so many people are critiquing the song instead they chalk up all critiques of it to the usual suspects misogyny racism religion the patriarchy etc but also go so far as to somehow fit colonialism fgm trump freud and faked orgasms into the blame game i pointed out male produced hiphop and rap has long been critiqued for its sexism and objectification and shallow presentation of sexual interaction so very obviously that critique of maledominated rap exists without people penning articles calling incredibly sexist and demeaning maleproduced rap or hiphop songs the epitome of male empowerment and claiming body shaming objectification unprotected sex etc are good things the way the various folks championing wap have with that track other words people already flip shit about the very crass and dehumanizing themes in maleproduced hiphop when these themes are appropriated into femaleproduced hiphop and countless woke progressives are tripping over themselves to laud it as amazing and awesome and the epitome of triumphs of all feminism those same people seem utterly unable to think of any reason why they and the song might get some criticism other than they must hate strong black women because of colonialism and trump what the fuck guys dont get it if a man had made a parallel track it might have already been subject to harsh critiques for being so misogynistic if it had simultaneously been widely praised for that misogyny it would have drawn even harsher criticism which is exactly what seems to have happened here also rather flabbergasted by the mental gymnastics and doublethink employed to complain that black female artists in hiphop are often degraded and hypersexualized or that our bodies are hypersexualised and plastered everywhere while simultaneously heaping an astounding amount of praise on a video and song that degrades and hypersexualizes female bodies fuck that video is raunchy enough to be softcore porn it almost invariably far surpasses any of the hypersexualization youd see on beer billboards or in car commercials or on any superbowl cheerleading squad or in any film raked over the coals for having a male gaze in all it seems to me that far from empowering women or fighting against objectification or being the hallmark of modern feminism all wap has done is sink to the lowest of the most egregious lows in all those regards encouraged a bunch of people to wax over how awesome that is and then have those same people act totally shocked when they get some pushback for it my view',\n",

       " 'cmv the manufactured levels of worldwide outrage over the current us situation are increasingly frustrating because the whole western world is completely silent when it comes to other global atrocities like literal genocide of uighurs and rohingyas edit thank you guys i’m new to this sub and it’s so refreshing to have a civil debate with rational wellwritten replies for a change rather than just insults etc  thanks again for all the replies please forgive me if you’ve written out a detailed response and i haven’t responded to it it was a bit overwhelming to wake up from a short nap to find  replies to try to discuss im terms of what ‘changed my mind’ it’s a strange one because my actual point probably comes across as a little blurry rather than specifically cmv the majority of the replies helped me to feel less annoyed i still feel annoyance at the inconsistency of world outrage but this has been abated somewhat now that it’s been explained exactly why this is the case  has been stewing in my mind for a few days now and its finally started to pss me off with the blackedout instagram gimmick today  firstly i am naturally completely aghast at the recent killing of george floyd a view which is almost completely unanimous across the western world the method and reporting of the riotsprotests isnt part of my cmv so ill avoid ranting about that  what is grinding my gears is the sudden outrage that appears to have suddenly sprung up in the last day or two in countries outside of the us floyd was killed on the th the news spread quickly to my home country of the uk and then the subsequent rioting spread even quicker it has taken until june for the social media virtue signallers to start point scoring and within a day it had caught hold and now everyone single post on facebook instagram and twitter is fellow white people trying to outdo each other on who can be the most antiracist  current hotandhappening trendy thing to do among young people is to go on a protest march and how else will your friends know that youre not racist unless you blackout your facebook picture you instagram story and your wallpaper at home everyone is doing it you wouldnt want to be uncool would you  like people simply didnt care that much until their friend their flavour of the month celebrity or their favourite sports team started posting selfpromoting patontheback slacktivism yes everyone knows your in solidarity everyone is in solidarity weve seen the video once again the whole western world is in solidarity by default because someone was just murdered its not black and white pun not intended i akmost certain that the vast majority of people outside of the us will have seen the news story thought about how horrifically unjust it was and then gone back to scrolling through their phoneslaptops  one half of my annoyance the mediamanifactured outrage around the world  that leads onto my main issue why is there such a deafening silence when it comes to arguably for more horrific actual genocide and repression of ethnic minorities in other countries im mainly referring to the crises of the rohingya muslims and chinese uighurs although i have no doubt theres others calling these issues worse may be controversial but im not here to sugar coat  unarmed black men were killed by cops in the us in  thats  too many and of course there are deep lying racial issues that go beyond police brutality but thats hardly comparible to village massacres and concentration camps  firmly believe that the media simply doesnt want us to care about those issues because theyre not as attractive to report about compared to heating up the pressure cooker and getting free news stories from a good old percieved race war on the home turf i can probably count on one hand the amount of uighur or rohingyarelated news coverage or social media activism ive seen over the years because how are you going to score internet bonus points with your friends when they have no idea who the uighurs are right the last time i can remember any sort of mass outrage over this kind of issue outside the western world was the kony  hysteria and that only lasted for a week why was everyone incensed yep because the media told us it was the cool thing to do at the time  counter argument ive seen to all this is well we cant really change bad countrys mind and while this is perhaps true the same is true for the current situation the us wont listen to years of pressure from its own citizens what the hell makes you think theyll even remotely care about your small protest in new zealand or the netherlands or your random english sports team staging a selfmasturbatory pr picture with all the players kneeling to this someone will probably reply its all about solidarity about awareness ok then surely everyone should want to show solidarity and awareness with the rohingya crisis if its that easy  dont even know what to think at this point am i annoyed at the currents riotsprotests for getting too much insipid support from people who only want to care because it benefits them in some way or am i more annoyed the other atrocities dont get the time of day in the media because theyre not as trendy as racism police brutality and f the system for the incredibly long post i didnt realise how much i was writing i probably couldve waffled and ranted for many more pages  want to change my mind im becoming increasingly cynical day by day and worrying its starting to make me turn a bit sour to the whole racist police cause as a whole',\n",

       " 'cmv it is not unfair to expect your so to at least attempt to maintain some form of physical attractiveness throughout the relationship i struggled with the title a bit so read on if it is unclear  view of mine stems from a debate i got into with a friend of mine lets call her sam we were discussing a mutual friend of ours who well call john who after years of being with his so broke up with her because she got fat sams words  at first glance yes that may be the heart of what happened but of course deep down a lot of other factors were at play johns so getting fat was a gradual process which reflected her level of comfort in a relationship she thought was stable and set for life she had done all the hard work  winning over john  and now that they have moved in together and had discussions about marriage and possibly kids she subconsciously or not thought she could finally let it go and not have to try so hard as blissful as that may be and for some perhaps the goal of a longterm relationship i think this mentality is fundamentally flawed and horribly unfair on john yes people change as they grow and yes when you marry or form a longterm relationship with someone you accept that but personality change over a lifetime is for the most part beyond ones control deciding to stop exercising drinking a bottle of wine every night after work and overindulging on biscuits while watching too much tv on the sofa as part of a daily ritual is not its a sign of resignation  is now in a difficult position he fell in love with the beautiful girl he met at that party she had a wonderful figure and clearly took care of her body her sexiness lit a fire under him and their chemistry was both physical and mental as they started dating he respected the effort she went to stay in good shape and she clearly didnt do it just to get the guy it was for herself too she was proud and confident of how she looked yet over the last couple of years all of this side of her had slowly disintegrated she just didnt care anymore her lack of caring for herself was in itself unattractive and john suddenly started having problems in the bedroom too as a result yet was he just being shallow should he just suck it up and accept this change as normal and continue in this relationship which he entered under conditions which have now changed without his consent if he finds her unattractive now after only a few years what will happen to their relationship in  years the end john did have many discussions with his so about this she accepted she had let things go a bit and said she would try harder but after another  months of no change he decided the best thing was to end it since he didnt feel the same way and the two parted ways  back to my debate with sam she was quite offended by johns behaviour to her he was obviously a very shallow man and his treatment of his exso was unfair i on the other hand was completely on johns side when you enter a longterm relationship with someone especially a marriage you make an agreement to try your best to love and be loved by that person for as long as you can you enter the agreement based on terms at that point in time i love you my so because of who you are and who i predict you will become yet when your so essentially breaks this contract and gives up being the person that you fell in love with your feelings for them are bound to change this goes for not only personality characteristics and psychological wellbeing but also physical appearance since no matter how all the romanticists like to spin it it is a culmination of all of these components which make up you as a person  they way he dealt with it was also very fair and full of communication he didnt just dump her suddenly he expressed his feelings to her gave her a chance to think it over and adapt it should she chose to she didnt and so for both of their best interests in the long run they split up  fundamental view is then that it is not unfair to expect your so to keep working for lack of a better word for your love and vice versa whether that be maintaining their physical appearance as best as time will let you of course or maintaining common interests so you dont hate each other in  years time for example it therefore is unfair for your so to give up and take marriagelongterm relationships as an excuse to stop trying love to hear some opinions this has blown up way more than i anticipated and i’m afraid i’d struggle to reply to everyone at this stage i really do appreciate all the responses on both sides of the argument and am fascinated by what everyone has to say as of yet my mind hasn’t been changed but i’ve certainly heard some great arguments i’ll keep checking in and will respond where i can i’m going to summarise a really common argument i keep seeing ”as we get old we all grow and change our bodies age beauty is temporary no one can stay physically attractive forever etc” to respond to this i wholeheartedly agree and accept that fact but i accept it as a slow process that takes decades and in most scenarios happens simultaneously to both partners as they age in john and his so’s example i presented above it happened suddenly within the first few years of their relationship and it was purely a onesided change again it keeps coming back to differing expectations and values john’s expectations of a healthy longterm relationship clearly didn’t include giving up all the advantages of an active and healthy lifestyle while he and his partner were still in their twenties whereas his so’s expectations were quite the contrary at this stage after only two years of living together they were already suffering attraction issues and the foundations of resentment were forming in their relationship surely that is evidence enough that their expectations in their relationship did not match and it would therefore be best for both of them to end it before it got more serious marriage and kids',\n",

       " 'cmv the controversy surrounding liam neesons recent interview is wholly irrational and shows plainly the counterprodictivity of outrage culture for those unfamiliar with the controversy ill give a brief overview liam neeson recently was giving an interview about his new movie cold pursuit which is being branded as a very dark comedy with the futilityuselessness of revenge being the main theme neeson talks about how the character is ultimately lead into a life of criminality and violence by his thirst for revenge very explicitly framing this as a negative thing in being asked by the interviewer how he channels that emotion to play the character he tells a story he says  years ago a close friend of his was brutally raped and in asking about who the rapist was discovered they were black he then says he went around for a week in black neighborhoods hoping some black bastard would start a fight with him so he could kill them any random black person he then says that when he finally came down from that emotional reaction of wanting revenge he was shocked and disgusted with the way it had made him behave he says he had been so ashamed of it that he had never told almost anyone about it up until that point but that he learned from the experience this prompted outrage on the internet with many calling for him to be banned form the oscars to be blacklisted by hollywood and even to have his oscar taken away is insane to me whats the goal of calling out racism and identifying it so that we all as a society may learn from it grow and hope to do better moving forward but also in the hopes that the person being racist will see the error of their ways and change this case you have a man most famous for playing a historical figure who helped jews during the holocaust who is not expressing racist thoughts and not engaging in racist behavior but rather is recounting thoughts and behavior from four decades ago and self describing it as shocking disgusting and having made him feel ashamed of himself this is a man who grew up in northern ireland while it was at war where bigotry was commonplace and revenge killings and bombings against catholics and protestants happened on a daily basis growing up in an environment like that bigotry is taught as second nature so enraged by his sense of revenge he went out with violent intentions aimed at an innocent group of people because he was taught to think that way this same man then realized what he was doing was wrong learned from it grew from it and seemingly has spent the rest of his life ashamed that his emotions and upbringing had caused him to think and behaves that way  is it that people hope to accomplish by punishing him he explicitly recognized that this was horrible and only brought it up in the context that seeking revenge makes people do horrible things he has already learned hes already grown this isnt even a gotcha moment that someone dug up from his past he volunteered it as an example of not the right way to think or behave how are we going to say hes racist some people point to his use of the phrase black bastard but if you listen in the clip hes describing his thought process at that time hes clearly speaking as his younger self and to ascribe that to how he feels today is intellectually disingenuous believe that by seeking to punish a man using his own experiences to teach and display the way that bigotry and anger can make you do awful things outrage culture is actively getting in the way of having the difficult conversations that need to be had about race the reddit app is giving me trouble not loading any comments beyond what ive  already responded  to and i wont be able to respond on a computer for a while just wanted to let people know im not dodging questions or responses im just literally unable to even see them  wow this really blew up while i was asleep ill be making an effort to get around to as many responses as i can this morning and afternoon since ill have access to my desktop do want to add in this edit both to make it relevant as per the rules but also because ive been seeing a lot of this argument that some of you need to justify the concept that humans either cant change or that there is a logical reason to not treat them differently for having changed many of you are arguing that essentially nobody should be forgiven for having held racist views or done racist things no matter how much theyve changed and no matter how badly they feel about it those people i want to ask several questions do you think that people can change if not why not given that we have mountains of psychological and historical evidence indicating otherwise do you think people who have changed should be treated as though they hadnt if so why given that in changing they definitionally are a different person than they were most importantly why what is the advantage of thinking this way how does never forgiving people help your cause of the opinion that if one truly hates racism and bigotry one has to conduct themselves in a way that facilitates change so that these ideals can be more quickly removed from society the only way that happens is by creating fewer racists one mode of doing this is by educating the young but another is by changing the minds of those who have been taught incorrectly so that they are both one fewer racist and also one more educator of their children to think the right way in order to change my view you must logically show how it follows that punishing people for being honest about the changes theyve made and for making those changes at all encourages social progress thing id like many of you to do is provide any evidence that youd have done better growing up in as hateful an environment as northern ireland during the troubles many of you as arguing that because not all people at any given point in time were racist that to have been conditioned to behave and think a certain way is inexcusable this to me is logically identical to the arguments made by actual modern racists in the us to justify calling black men rapists and murderers it ignores everything we understand about psychology and the role nurture plays in developing personality to clarify since many if you seem patently wrong about this sorry if thats rude but its true i am not and neeson himself is not justifying his past actions he views them as disgusting shocking and shameful i also view them that way in explaining the thought process that lead him to take these actions he is not justifying them he is explaining them there is both a definitional and from the perspective of the listener i believe also a moral difference between explaining how an intense emotion can lead someone from the wrong type of upbringing to do an awful thing and saying that the awful thing isnt awful because of the context at no point have i or neeson argued that what he did wasnt awful or that it was justified  id like to moderators allowing make one final edit to a point that i am seeing very commonly and would more easily be addressed here though it may not seem an important distinction when you are trying to view a man as unforgivable neeson didnt hurt anyone not because he didnt encounter any black people but because none started fights with him he wasnt roaming the streets looking for any black person minding their own business to beat up and kill he was hoping to be attacked so that he could feel justified in defending himself this is an important distinction for multiple reasons one it shows though still heinous that even at his worst he was not trying to be a murderer he was trying to be a racist vigilante two it shows very clearly the social bias at the time which is still present today that he figured black people were thugs and criminals so he figured if he just walked around one would give him cause to enact his again unjustified and racist revenge three and most importantly it is exactly because he took this approach instead of killing some random black person that not only was nobody hurt but that it showed him exactly how wrong he was it proved plainly that this group of people were not all like his friends rapist that black people arent just thugs and criminals and that it was disgusting shocking and shameful in his own words to behave the way he did this is implicit in him describing that he learned from the experience because he realized exactly what he was and what he was doing in looking to be attacked and not being attacked he realized how repulsive his actions and thoughts were once the emotion of the moment had faded to fail to make the distinction between he didnt kill a black person because he never saw a black person and he didnt kill a black person because none attacked him is to entirely miss the point of the story that he was trying to make as well as to factually misrepresent it and to ignore how this event influenced his views to change in the future',\n",

       " 'cmv this is a racial cultural socioeconomic and police brutality issue not just a single one of them recently i have been seeing many posts suggesting that its only one of these issues there can be multiple issues and multiple solutions to this problem \\n want to start by explaining why i think its a racial issue followed by socioeconomic status then culture and lastly police brutality\\n think that this is an issue that goes back to the beginning of america for centuries black people have been oppressed slavery was immensely damaging to the black family this is not comparable to how the chinese were treated and how the irish were indentured servants  also the confederate constitution specifically singles out african negroes as slaves not irish people also neither country was ravaged as heavily as african countries by european people  in any case after literal lifetimes of slavery black folks were hit very harshly with jim crow laws which didnt end until the s the origins of gangs with african americans actually started because they had to defend themselves from racists while also trying to make a dollar  final factor encouraging gang formation was the\\xa0chicago race riot of  in which gangs of white youth terrorized the black community and in response black youth formed groups for selfprotection quote \\xa0antiblack violence\\xa0on the part of white youths directly contributed to black youths forming selfprotection societies that transformed into black gangs by the late s wikipedia page theres redlining which still hurts some minorities today the war on drugs was specifically targeted to harm black people  so many racist laws and practices were put into effect and still affect so many black families today black folks were oppressed for so long and then pretty much expected to catch up and build on a foundation that racist society effectively shattered and did not take adequate measures to repair also according to yales empirical analysis of racial differences in police while the police shoot and murder black and white folks at roughly the same rate controlled for different factors they also found that black and hispanic folks are  more likely to be subject to some force when being arrested the study suggests that when controlled for contextual and behavioral factors the number is reduced but still doesnt explain racial disparities this has the same abstract section furthermore yale concluded that while being compliant and no arrest has been made black people are  more likely to be subject to force  this article points out some disparities in drug use blacks in our study were more likely to be incarcerated on charges explicitly labeled as drugrelated blacks would also be more likely to suffer the collateral consequences specifically associated with drug charges such as exclusion from certain forms of financial aid housing benefits and job screening scrutiny  response to the current opioid epidemic a public health crisis with a “white face” has been contrasted to the crack epidemic that hit black communities hard in the s and was met with war tactics in affected communities rather than compassion for offenders black and white people use and sell drugs at the same rate black people are punished more for it source  ironically in the study linked above it showed that in that particular city black people were more interested in marijuana as opposed to white people who were more interested in heroin black drug offenders also get sentenced more harshly  black people are more likely to have their cars searched and less likely to be explained a reason why a rhode island study also showed they were likely to be stopped and somehow less likely to receive a citation to me this suggests that they were effectively stopped for no reason a study\\xa0in new york city\\xa0showed\\xa0that blacks were more likely than whites or nonblack minorities to be in jail while they await trial even after controlling for the seriousness of charges and prior record black people are also  more likely to receive a plea deal that included longer jail time again controlling for factors such as prior record researchers\\xa0found that north carolina prosecutors were excluding black people from juries in capital cases at twice the rate of other jurors even when controlling for legitimate justifications for striking jurors such as employment status or reservations about the death penalty\\xa0black convicts have their probation revoked more often than whites and other minorities according to a\\xa0study\\xa0of probation outcomes in iowa new york oregon and texas these racial disparities held even when the study controlled for other characteristics of the probationers such as their age crime severity and criminal history\\xa0source even disparities in speeding tickets and frisk is also widely considered to be a racist policy directly attributed to blacks being unable to move from poorer areas to nicer neighborhoods and gain wealth through owning property in nicer neighborhoods it also prevented their children and future generations from accessing better schools\\n\\n implicit racial bias plays a big role in black kids underperforming\\n\\n \\n\\n status studies have shown black people are directly harmed because of their socioeconomic status even in health care redlining and poor schools did not help with this while a lot of people enjoying citing that black people commit substantially more crimes than white people they forget to acknowledge the context surrounding black people besides just the racial element we see that crime is heavily linked to poverty and the rate of poverty among black people is quite high while it is true that poor white people still commit less crimes they also seem to live in less densely populated areas as well for example centreville illinois has a population of about  according to the census and a population density of  and  of the people who live there are black the crime rates are  higher than the national average similar results were found for selma alabama it may also be attributed to a culture  study finds that the gross rates of violence are two and a half to five times greater in the three types of nonwhite neighborhoods than in white areas  but these differences drop to a maximum of one and three quarters after critical community conditions are taken into account table   these ccommunity conditions seem to be differences in access to external resources such as home loans and socioeconomic disadvantages\\n status has been proven to be one of the best predictors for success study showing it’s just as important as cognitive ability and personality traits\\n\\n are directly influenced by their environment they dont just appear out of thin air and they certainly arent genetic there are no inherent genetic differences such as being more prone to violence either this notion has been denounced by anthropologists and biologists alike and no humans are not like dog breeds and that is a historically racist analogy the number of loci analyzed is the most critical variable with  polymorphisms accurate classification is possible but ω remains sizable even when using populations as distinct as subsaharan africans and europeans phenotypes controlled by a dozen or fewer loci can therefore be expected to show substantial overlap between human populations this provides empirical justification for caution when using population labels in biomedical settings with broad implications for personalized medicine pharmacogenetics and the meaning of race source from the same report in a reanalysis of data from  microsatellite loci typed in  individuals europeans proved to be more similar to asians than to other europeans  of the time another quote \\xa0it is also compatible with our finding that even when the most distinct populations are considered and hundreds of loci are used individuals are frequently more similar to members of other populations than to members of their own population thus caution should be used when using geographic or genetic ancestry to make inferences about individual phenotypes\\n no black folks dont just disregard education because they arent genetically capablehere is an article i find interesting the various studies cited in the article found is that black students value education as much or even slightly more than their white counterparts in any case i believe that this culture is a direct result of racism a society that was once extremely racist held black people down and it effectively molded the culture that others now deem ghetto for example the gangs i mentioned above and also more unfair practices even into the s lots of people dont realize that only until half a century or so ago blacks were effectively not allowed to buy houses in many cities redlining is not an ancient practice realtors and city lawmakers got together in the early to mid th century and literally drew lines where black people and other nonwhites were allowed to live outside the line and nobody would sell you a house banks wouldnt give you a mortgage regardless of your ability to pay typically the minority districts didnt have much real estate for sale as it was mostly rental property so you have multiple generations of people barred from building up any kind of equity or wealth parents unable to help save their children from financial ruin people having to rely on welfare to survive welfare is tricky because its a system designed to keep you reliant on it\\nid argue the current hood culture is a direct result of racist policies like redlining as well as misguided wellintentioned social engineering creation of housing projects welfare system in the s the end of slavery black people have beenand continue to be either in law or in practicesubject to housing discrimination mortgage discrimination job discrimination exclusion from political representation police brutality the schooltoprison pipeline the prisonindustrial complex and so on and so forth prejudice and disenfranchisement in turn contribute to worse health outcomes the cycle of poverty and limited social mobility idea of a black culture as the single cause of systemic poverty of black americans is fairly incoherent it assumes that there is some uniform black culture with stable features and asserts that the characteristics of that culture account for some unique varianceover and above other factorsin the present socioeconomic conditions of black people this portion was an answer from a redditor a while back note that i am only referring to the negative aspects of the culture that people like to refer to rnb rock and roll soul disco house and jazz originated with black peopleculture for example also one of the biggest disadvantages that is specific to black americans is the removal of their culture and heritage african immigrants are more likely to have a college degree than the average american as a user mentioned earlier i failed to acknowledge black fathers not purposely though i was just caught up with other issues  to this statistics show that close to  percent of all births to black mothers are nonmarital giving rise to the stereotype that black fathers are largely absent however while black fathers are less likely than white and hispanic fathers to marry their childs mother many black fathers continue to parent through cohabitation and visitation providing caretaking financial and inkind support \\n\\n\\n brutality and by extension inappropriate actions have addressed a lot of this above so i have less to say about it it is undeniable that police brutality can occur to anyone and it has i think a problem equally as large is how easy they get off though the same yale study i mentioned above actually suggests that it is quite rare for police officers to be held accountable even jimmy

       " 'cmv the fact that innocent people have been convicted in the us proves juries need better instruction on what beyond a reasonable doubt means to date there have been at least  wrongfully convicted defendants exonerated as the result of dna evidence and though they spent an average of fifteen years behind bars those are the lucky ones we dont know how many more wrongfully convicted people sit in jail today because there is no funding to pursue their case or there simply is no dna evidence available the fact that any defendants are wrongfully convicted in a system that is supposed to presume innocence and where guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt is my main concern here i take the fact that so many are wrongfully convicted as evidence that juries just do not understand the basic underpinnings of our legal system and need better instructions it should literally be impossible to prove something happened beyond a reasonable doubt if it in fact did not happen you might feel pretty sure that something that didnt happen happened you might believe something that didnt happen probably happened but you should never be in a situation where you believe beyond a reasonable doubt that something that didnt happen happened hundreds of juries apparently came to these conclusions suggests that there are serious problems with how jurors are instructed i think that there are two places where these poor instructions need to be addressed jurors and our legal system in general do not seem willing to take into account how unreliable eye witness accounts are nearly  of the wrongful convictions mentioned above involved misleading or misidentified eye witness testimony psychologists have known for a long time that we have bad memories even people who are certain they are telling the truth and in fact are telling the truth as they remember it are in fact incorrect juries need to be made aware of this when they evaluate testimony you shouldnt need to call an expert psychologist in every case this should just be standard jury instruction maybe part of a juror introduction packet if you will also the reliability or unreliability of other kinds of evidence forensic tests etc should be included in instruction to the jury it is insane that many states outright refuse to define what beyond a reasonable doubt means i argue that better instructions should be given to jurors about this phrase in every case where someone is innocent reasonable doubt should exist because the crime literally didnt happen that means the prosecution is relying on circumstantial or eye witness testimony to make their case in every one of these instances it is reasonable to doubt that the person committed the crime it may also be necessary to improve the representation of defendants one could argue that reasonable doubt didnt exist based on the cases presented even with the best instructions if that is the case we need to expand our public defender offices so every defendant gets the kind of defense that can explain just why the prosecutions evidence is doubtful expect that some will come back with well if you took that definition seriously then we would let a lot of guilty people go free i agree i think it is a greater harm to imprison and potentially kill an innocent person than it is to let a guilty person go free presumption of innocence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt is our standard if we take this seriously an innocent person should never ever be convicted the fact that innocent people have been convicted means we need to make one or all of the changes above change my view never expected so many responses  a lot of them are really good but i want to respond to a few of the kinds of responses all at once as i cant get to all of these if we actually adopt this standard well never convict anyone practical implications of juries really understanding when it is reasonable to doubt something are not what im arguing here it may be that if juries really understood this we would never convict anyone if thats the case you could argue we shouldnt use the innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt standard but its not an argument against my original post which is if juries got better instructions we would have no convictions of innocent people having no convictions of any people is actually consistent with this view even if you find such a world objectionable what would you consider beyond a reasonable doubt honest answer is im not sure given what i know about the fallibility of the human memory the legal system and forensic evidence it is actually hard to think of a scenario where there is not a reasonable doubt as to someones guilt that is why i conclude that juries either must not know about these things or they just dont care or they know and care but care more about making sure bad guys go to jail ',\n",

       " 'cmv a middle class person is better off living in a small eu country than in us this is not really us bashing it is actually related to a personal choice and by explaining my thought process i think i am able to represent an average person here dont get me wrong my ego is big and i dont think of my self as average in most cases but in terms of lifestyle and class i certainly think i am i also dont want to discuss trump at all i recently had a debate with someone who still thinks us provides the most to people who live in it so i want to see what can us give me that would make me want to live there instead of my very unimpressive country am croatian our country had a war is now in eu our politicians are generally incompetent we are no economic force our salaries are not impressive i find it beautiful but i also find us beautiful and i wont be discussing emotional reasons to live in either place here just saying im not from scandinavia or germany to rightfully brag about doing things better than the us but most european countries even those not in eu share certain privileges  am university educated with a masters at the moment it didnt cost me anything and i have work experience in one unrelated but very solid field however while this maybe puts me a bit above average i am not an entrepreneur like most people arent and have no interest or ability to run my own business i also dont need to make tons of money i of course appreciate a good salary and want to be able to live a sustainable self reliant comfortable and safe lifestyle  but for me that means  owning an apartmentplace to live not having debt having retirement savings being protected in cases of sickness or medical emergencies being able to pay bills go out take courses in something that interests me travel affordably have ikea furniture and wear hm nothing extravagant because i realistically dont need it and it doesnt motivate me  also care about work life balance a lot i want to have free time for myself for my interests for people i dont want my job dominating my life most people dont we need time off we need vacations i fear that if i go to us i will lose generous vacation time and work will be much more intense i would probably not have a month off or more every year and limitless sick days i will make more money but everything will be more expensive and i will desperately depend on my job for medical insurance so if i quit or lose my job for a short while i cant get sick  id rather be unemployed somewhere where it doesnt threaten my livelihood than working somewhere where i cant afford to quit  brings me to medical insurance i do understand that while us doesnt have a free health care you are often insured through work but many are not i saw tons of people on reddit explain how much they got into debt because of an accident that involved emergency so not like they had a choice not to go  it also seems that your insurance plan might not cover many things if youre not rich which leads to so many movie and show plots where characters have to do something crazy to afford healthcare for themselves or loved one i hear the argument about being able to choose your doctors but none of it makes sense to me what do i need to choose for if i am sick the only thing i want is that i am helped and cured and that i dont have to worry about money during that people still have private providers if they want to pay for some additional comforts  but even those private providers arent that expensive in comparison because they still have to make sense to people who are getting it for free  i dont want kids which saves me a lot of problems but the majority of people do so lets also explore what that would mean if i wanted to have a kid in my shitty country i would not need to be rich my medical expenses would be covered kindergardens are cheap or even free i will mention but not focus on the cultural element too where most of us get tremendous help from our families allowing people more free time but to an extent that is not a guarantee for all i head that childcare in us is so expensive that often one parent has to stop working because they simply cant manage it so in the country where without money youre nothing one person has to lose their job and the other has to better not end up losing it no matter how bad it gets  wed have t think about school public schools in my country and a lot of europe are better than private schools and poor kids and rich kids attend them together usually when rich kids go to a private school its because they werent good students in a public school so the equal opportunity is literally there i wouldnt have to save ridiculous sums id much rather have in my own savings for college because a kid will go into college by merit and if i do need to put my kid in a private college because they were bad academically and i dont want them to do a trade school which btw lead to very good employment opportunities and should not be dismissed it wont be expensive because again its competing with free stuff  will now say that at least their higher education is the best in world ok i think our free universities are very good too but objectively yes expensive private universities can afford state of the art facilities and renowned professionals who come and teach but the class plays such a huge role in where someone will end up there are some scholarships to keep up the appearance but from what i understand many of the us public schools are very poor quality or the quality ones require you to live in a certain limited location while rich kids get prepared from early on a good public school student who maybe wont get a special scholarship because they arent extraordinary in sport what does that have to do with anything or in any other way that will get huge attention will be worse off than a bad private school student because in the end while merit might help a small minority money will help everyone to get their place even if theyre not academically gifted at all it seems to me that these amazing colleges just serve to give credibility to the already rich who will go on being rich anyway so that they can pretend that theyre actually smart cause they went to harvard and maintain the illusion that even the poormiddle class can do it if they work hard enough  final point i know the least about is property in my country most of us own property  poor middle class upper middle class all have some property they inherited or are able to buy apartments for their kids during the socialist time many people were given property  my grandpa used his completely average middle class yugoslavia salary to buy each of his kids an apartment a big house on the seaside etc i understand that maybe this was an extraordinary situation and market isnt like that but i also dont understand why americans need huge houses and cars and debt either maybe this is more lifestyle issue than something that belongs here but the debt part  i understand you are forced to use a credit card in america or else you dont get access to housing loans so a person who doesnt buy into the whole consumerism and wants to save money is actually penalized the one time they need to loan to buy property and stop renting  will point out that none of these things are free and we all pay more taxes sure but again for an average persons average salary with the taxes deducted from it we get healthcare education retirement care in cases of emergencies and good social programmes as a support through hard times if your goal is to be an entrepreneur get filthy rich and dont want too many limitations or taxes because you dont have to give a shit maybe us is the place for you  most people including smart and educated people want a good life they want balance they want to be safe they want their family to be taken care of they want the freedom to quit a bad job or get sick without going bankrupt they want time to themselves and people in their lives i just dont see how the us provides that i dont think us is a good place for most people to live in because it forces you to have to be rich to have a decent life i dont really see what id get as an averagemiddle class person in the us and think life for that group is better in almost any european country including small economically weaker ones i dont think pursuit of money is really a choice in that context and i dont think its a great way to live a life',\n",

       " 'cmv news coverage is now so poor that following the news will actually make you less informed about reality than ignoring it in the last year ive found myself very reluctantly coming to the conclusion that there is no longer any point whatsoever in attempting to stay informed by watching reading or listening to any mainstream news sources no matter its position on the political spectrum   occasional examples of good journalism or rare investigative articles can be found from nearly any source i believe that any relevant information you can learn from these rare cases is massively outweighed by the sheer quantity of misinformation and propaganda that you are exposed to in discovering them  my core points are the following the introduction of social media and clickdriven internet traffic have created a perverse environment where good journalism is punished and bad journalism heavily rewarded  \\n the increased competition and pressure on the media from the above has resulted in the downsizing of traditional news rooms  unfortunately the first positions to be lost were specialist technical and expert positions meaning most journalists are no longer knowledgeable on the fields they are assigned to report on\\n governments and politicians have learned increasingly effective methods of propaganda in the last decade which news sources either have no interest in counteracting or no ability to counteract  the truth is now indistinguishable from lies\\n even if somehow you manage to spend enough time and energy extracting the truth from the lies you will be shouted over by the many more people who believe the lie and believe it firmly  politics has become so polarized that the truth is irrelevant the brief summary  to clarify in more depth the reasons why i believe the above internet is a perverse environment is the best example of the perverse incentives created by the way news media is now funded  it appears abundantly clear to me that the media will report stories and articles they know to be misleading or downright false simply because they know they generate outrage and traffic  this has always been true to some extent or another throughout history newspapers have been making money from peddling outrage  however until recent years there was a genuine effort by respectable news sources not to lower themselves to this kind of coverage  i can no longer find any news sources which still seem to make this effort  the economics of the internet mean that news sources can no longer survive at all without publishing false stories and clickbait in an effort to drive traffic to their website is dead part and parcel of the contraction of the media all news companies have been forced to downsize and the first places to suffer staffing and budget cuts have been the least profitable and more niche departments  media companies are no longer willing to pay high salaries to journalists with strong expertise in specific areas  this is a longer term trend which has been happening for decades even before the internet completely eclipsed paper journalism the cumulative effect of it over time is that nearly every news article is produced by someone with no specialist knowledge or experience whatsoever  errors and complete ignorance of an articles topic are commonplace and chances are any article you read on a technical topic is either lifted wholesale from a press release or published by someone with no further knowledge or understanding than any random member of the public is such a broad topic and with so much written on it that i dont feel that i have the space to go into it here  for the sake of simplicity ill stick to one propaganda strategy by way of an example believe that the firehose of falsehood has become an incredibly widespread tool within politics both national and international  i also believe that there has been a complete and utter failure by the media to counteract it and it may be completely impossible for any media source to counteract this strategy   proliferation of this propaganda strategy is one of the key reasons i believe that it is not worth trying to stay informed any more  the more you expose yourself to journalism as it currently stands the more vulnerable you are to manipulation using this strategy are poor at separating a convenient lie from an inconvenient truth at the best of times  we are exceptionally good at choosing to believe what we would prefer to believe rather than what the evidence shows to be true  this has been true since the dawn of time but the increased polarization arising from the internet driving us into bubbles has destroyed the only countermeasure to this  regular exposure to people we disagree with  the effect of this is that even if i somehow manage to discover the truth behind the falsehoods its a useless truth  it cant be spread to anyone other than the people who are already inclined to believe it because the majority of people now openly reject even objective facts which contradict their political position also add that on this point i wont be convinced by the what if everyone thought that way argument as i have no control what other people think  to quote catch \\n\\n but yossarian suppose everyone felt that way  \\nthen said yossarian id certainly be a damned fool to feel any other way wouldnt i”      can elaborate on these views further if need be  on a personal level i myself was always someone who tried very hard to recognize the truth behind media sources despite the problems with journalism and reporting that have always existed  my previous belief was that even if falsehoods were widespread it was possible to slowly change peoples minds as long as you have a good understanding of the facts and could give people information without being judgmental or overly zealous   only fairly recently that ive come to the depressing conclusion that its now futile to try this and its better to completely give up on trying to cut through the wall of bullshit produced by the media  the only hope i currently hold for this is that as older generations who are unfamiliar with the internet die off newer generations will be much more prepared for and capable of adjusting their thinking to avoid being mislead by false information  however this is only a hope and i can see no evidence that younger generations are less prone to being mislead than older generations',\n",

 factsheet\\n we have taken adequate measures and might have prevented such abuse from strangers by teaching children common practises such as stranger danger ive not been able to find evidence of children being educated on how the close circle of family and friends may be more likely to house such nefarious individuals parents feel that it might cause their children to distrust every family member they meet or they dont want to create an atmosphere of fear at every christmas party but that doesnt alter the fact that creating a fanciful environment for a child makes him more vulnerable to the machinations of a proximate predator wonder if teaching stories from the grimm fairy tales might have actually not been a bad idea in the middle ages when children were highly prone to being exploited granted theyve an excessive level of violence and gore likely since adults arent sure how to ensure that children grasp the seriousness of certain situations certainly a partially diluted version or an interactive version of the same could be used to teach children the possible dangers of sexual abuse from trusted individuals have forgotten their childhood memories and need to relearn how it is to be a child and grow up everyday a better understanding of their child may allow parents to better communicate such dangers without scarring or depressing them read not advocating to scare children in to distrusting everyone however sitting idly by is definitely just as bad my view is that we need a method that is as mainstream like stranger danger where we can progressively teach them some form of elementary critical thinking as they age dont need to be taught to be scared of everyone rather as they grow up they need to be taught how to identify such problematic situations what they may experience and the options available to them  child sexual abuse comes from close quarters such as family and friends\\n children need to be taught the mainstream equivalent of stranger

       " 'cmv fines should be based on the percentage of the offenders total wealth not a set amount of money several countries including switzerland already do this  are meant to be a punishmentdeterrent that isn’t quite as harsh as prison time that said there are rich fucks here in north america that couldn’t care less about their drunken spoiled kid’s behaviour or their own because the fines are so insignificant  top of that many rich people from europe and other parts of the world aren’t even aware of the stigma of paying a fine they literally see it as “it costs  to litter” “it costs  to go over the speed limit” etc they’re technically right but the fact that they view it that way should be a red flag that using a set amount of money as a deterrent doesn’t work on some people is universal yet the effect of a trustfund billionaire paying a  fine vs someone with only  of savings being charged with the same is vastly different but it’s far more equal when the punishment for a small offence for both of these fellows is having to pay  of their total net worth  is a number i pulled out of my ass as long as it’s an equal percentage for everyone and not a draconian enough percentage to make jail time preferable lawmakers could agree on a reasonable amount as long as it’s equal for everyone side note i remembered when writing this for corporations and politicians the fines should be even more damaging  get hit with fines that aren’t even based on how much they profited from the illegal activity like the degenerate pieceofshit family the sacklers who own the company purdue pharma that debatably started the american opioid crisis and canada’s by extension \\nthese people conducted the nflbig tobaccostyle propaganda campaign of “our product isn’t that bad” paying off corrupt doctors and spokespeople to downplay how addictive opioids are and years later when it was too late purdue pharma was fined  million a whopper right by this time purdue pharma had raked in  billion dollars that fine was a drop in the bucket their bank accounts should have been gutted for what they did this wasn’t a deterrent to other predatory corporate titans from trying something like this if anything it was a public demonstration that anything is allowed as long as your illegal activities make more profit than the expense of paying the fine have at it the fine is nothing more than an expense you have to factor into your business plan  to what i said about the fines for individuals “not a draconian enough percentage to make jail time preferable” i stand by this but it should be the opposite for major political and corporate fines if you’re going to abuse that amount of power the fines should be based on of the money you made from the illegal activities   of your remaining net worth after that fine  can count the first and second section as separate change my view  a lot of people ask what would become of someone in debt or with no money we would pay them just kidding the solution to this is basing the fine on a percentage of net worth but introducing a baseline amount that the fine cannot go any lower than we could keep the cost  of the fines now as the level that the fines cannot go any lower than  “net worth” in this context is the amount of cash the offender has plus everything they own or own part of that can be converted into cash  i’m going to stop arguing for and against a broke person paying a baseline amount of money or not it’s great to hear different points of view from people but the comments are torn about  between “a single mom shouldn’t have to worry about paying the next bill due to a baseline fine if you only have  losing  is a big hit” which i should note is the effect of the system we have now and “if someone has no or almost no money the system would allow them to do whatever they wanted and they would be free of consequences” which is a good argument for a baseline amount of money the fine costs i’ve heard both sides i won’t be fully siding with either   no this does not punish people for being frugal and smart with their money if you and your neighbour both have to pay a ticket you have  that you have in your car your house and your kids college and you have some cash leftover and your irresponsible neighbour “blew  on a stupid boat” and has no cash you will still be fined equally \\nthe boat would not be accounted for as a boat it would be considered  in the form of a boat  to edit  “net worth” in this context is the amount of cash the offender has plus everything they own or own part of that can be converted into cash guessed it if your ‘financially irresponsible’ neighbour has to sell his boat to pay the fine and have the extra cash left over that’s his problem not yours i’ll edit edit  to include this a lot of people are asking  used the boat as an example precisely because it’s something that retains value if your neighbour spent all his money on things that don’t retain value like food vacations and hookers —things that are briefly consumed and are then gone— was the neighbour unwise with his money sure let’s say he was but since he spent all that money on things that didn’t retain value that chunk of his net worth is simply gone he is now at a lower networth than you are and will still be fined accordingly   jesus christ no this punishment is not the same as “sentencing a year old to twenty  years in jail vs year old to only one year in jail for the same crime because “they have more time left” nor do i think this is equivalent to raising all crimes to be punishable by death you can’t buy more time and i think the commenters suggesting everyone be sentenced to equal times of community service have a great point h lost to a tech titan is h lost to a homeless person whether or not they could have used this time to be productive to society is irrelevant just take it out of their free time einstein',\n",

       " 'cmv gender dysphoria is a mental disorder this topic has already been discussed in this sub once before but i was left severely dissatisfied with this thread op barely reviewed or discussed the counterclaims presented blindly went along with whatever was being said from analysing the thread it seems clear that op got caught up in political correctness—causing no offense and respecting everyone—to the point where hisher capacity to critically analyse the refutations was diminished to the point where heshe just accepted them no questions asked respect everyone i firmly believe that discrimination and stigma only cause harm i dont intend to cause any offense on purpose however in the interest of an honest discussion i may offend someone thats the nature of discussing controversial topics such as gender identity and politics you cant get around offense if you want to have a meaningful rational discussion with this in mind if youre offended by my arguments—keep in mind that they dont come from a place of hatred or discrimination i wont apologise if youre offended though instead of complaining or feeling put down channel that energy into something positive and change my view  that preamble out of the way i want to outline my view fully so as to leave no room for misinterpretation  there are two biological sexes intersex is a term reserved for describing people with medical disorders such as chromosomal disorders malformed genitalia etc  gender is biologically dependent  of people identify as the same gender as their biological sex to deny that a causal relationship here is absurd cultural differences in masculine and feminine roles have a role to play theres a significant overlap of interests between men and women but it has been shown that as societies trend toward gender equality differences in temperament and interests between genders increase this suggests that gender differences between men and women are to an extent biologically dependent  gender is binary an individual may exhibit traits of varying masculinityfemininity some men may exhibit overwhelmingly feminine characteristics theres nothing wrong with this theres nothing wrong with identifying with these characteristics either in the same way that theres nothing wrong with identifying as a banker if you work at a bank  gender dysphoria gd is the distress a person feels due to a mismatch between their gender identity and their biological sex  identity is not the same as sexual orientation attraction the stress homosexuals and bisexuals feel come as a result of not feeling accepted by peers and society trans people dont feel this is enough—they desire to change their bodies to fit their identity  gd is a socially accepted delusion a delusion is an idiosyncratic belief or impression maintained despite being contradicted by reality or rational argument typically as a symptom of mental disorder reality you are a male body delusion you are a female you feel great stress and discomfort because you identify as a female trapped in a male body this denies the reality that you are in fact a male body i draw similarities here to anorexia—anorexics deny the reality that they are underweight their delusion is that they are overweight thus they feel compelled to lose weight in response to this delusion people experiencing gd feel compelled to change their sex in response to their delusion that they are not the sex they are both anorexia and gd are stigmatised to some extent in society one is socially accepted and encouraged the other is not  gd may or may not be able to be cured i draw no conclusions here the evidence on both sides is scarce on one hand some data suggest that sex reassignment surgery alleviates symptoms of gd the extent to which is debatable however some societies countries universities etc have recently taking the position that even considering gd as a potential mental illness is hate speech and offensive this prevents genuine research into the nature of gd and possible treatment in favour of giving in to the delusion in the form of hormone treatment and surgery  you can fight against discrimination and stigma while still recognising gd as a disorder just like you can fight against discrimination and stigma while recognising bipolar depression schizophrenia etc as mental disordersillnesses is wrong with exhibiting feminine traits if you’re a male and vice versa nothing is wrong with dressing outside cultural norms or identifying yourself with those behaviours and traits but if you are discontent with the body you are then you have a mental disorder look forward to hearing your rebuttals im glad to see this thread is generating some real discussion thanks everyone  ive realised after some discussion that there are some points in this post which i could have defined better and clarified further ive also had my view changed on certain points for the sake of reference though im going to leave the post above exactly how i originally wrote it',\n",

       " 'cmv the shape of water is an extremely overrated movie and should have never won the oscar for best picture i recently rewatched the shape of water and i am not a movie critique nor expert but the realization dawned on me that it is an exquisitely bland movie that lacks an absurd amount of substance the shape of water plays on to the basic beauty and the beast trope but it does not go any further than that the movie weighs heavily on the cinematography and strays away from any actual plot or substance it is an intermediate form of movie writing and does not deserve any more than a redbox rental the movie barely dives into the actual underlying foundation for why anything happens there is no room for individual thought and it is pressed into the viewer’s brain that there is only one way to think and that is with the protagonist according to vox it’s a beautifully shot movie with a story that follows the traditional arcs of a fairy tale romance i believe that it is exactly why it should not have won it has been done before compared to other past winners such as moonlight which was original and intriguing is no relevance to the shape of water no bigger picture a mute woman falls in love with a sea creature who likes eggs if that’s the precedent for winning an oscar then the leprechaun would have been a phenomenal candidate the movie is visually outstanding but so is the curious case of benjamin button and it is an incredibly lifeless movie starring brad pitt without the visuals the movie would merely be a pathetic case for an “original” plot quite honestly coming from guillermo del toro i would not expect much all of his movies rely on visuals such as crimson peak or the hobbit these movies appeal to the eye and the only oscar that this movie truly deserved was best visuals the movie is basic with jaw dropping visuals the movie won four oscars so it is obviously well received and i’d like to understand what is so special about its standard format change my view',\n",

       " 'cmv  all jobs should be required to state the exact salary for a given role up front next to the other crucial details of the job im sick of seeing job advertisements that simply detail the salary as competitiveand thats it as soon as you start the process of applying theres literally no mention of the salary they want me to sell myself to them and talk about why im passionate without addressing the main reason why im getting a job which is to earn some damned money fact id say that the salary is the number one most important thing i care about in a job and thus i expect to be told it at the same time if not before all the other details of employment this would really crack down on gender pay gaps  you cant exactly pay people differently depending on ethnicity or gender if the wage is stated on the advertisement all just seems a bit backwards to me i get theres the potential issue of people wanting to keep their salary private but that seems like a small price to pay no pun intended for full pay equality and companies not scamming me into employment with their competitive salary how about you tell me what the salary is and ill decide for myself if its fuckin competitive thanks to all of you who raised very valid points and sorry to those who i didnt get around to replying to  i spent two hours yesterday replying to posts and i had more notifications at the end of the two hours than at the start so i ultimately gave up i hope that for the ones i did reply to i offered some constructive counter arguements to peoples points and conceded good arguements where they arose and ultimately provided a half decent debate for you all still believe that overall there should be more transparency to what wages are in advance but ill consider my view has changed to respect the following if the salary is posted as a flat figure employees lose the right to negotiate it and employers lose the right to offer more attractive due to skill experience etc employees more money to entice then in this could be remedied by using a starting from figure that could be increased if applicants showed a higher than necessary level of aptitude for a role  although someone did point out this removes the ability for an employer to offer an underqualified candidate less money if they wanted to take that chance a lot of you raised the point that while it would be convenient for employees to know the salary in advance it wouldnt benefit the employer to have to post such a thing therefore this would be a bit of a crap law to pass i didnt reply to the majority of these because it was past the  hour mark when i had given up but its a solid point that i would have to concede it is not detrimental to ask an employer for their salary range so you would never really have to apply to a job without knowing the salary i thought that by asking this you would make it seem like you are only interested in the money something that is of course true in a lot of places but employers dont like to hear but i was wrong about that the last interesting point was raised by someone in the comments and that was essentially that instead of advertising the salary range in the job listings all employees should be required to disclose the salarys of their employees probably in an anonymous way so applicants know they are getting a fair wage and employees also know they arent being discriminated against i think this was the best point anyone raised and if i was going to cmv to anything it would be this congrats udefunctwalrus',\n",

       " 'cmv there is a stronger case for a maximum age for us presidential eligibility than a minimum age the us constitution requires a candidate to be  years or older to be president donald trump was the oldest candidate to be elected president at age  and three leading candidates for the democratic nomination in  joe biden bernie sanders and elizabeth warren are in their s with sanders the oldest being  on the day of the  election personally lean towards there being no age restrictions beyond reaching the age of majority and i’m not even that concerned about that to run for president but i think if we’re going to accept the logic of them an upper age limit makes at least as much sense as a minimum age argument for minimum age limits is primarily that younger candidates will often be too inexperienced and immature to handle the office of president the argument for maximum age limits is primarily that older candidates have a heightened risk of death impairment andor cognitive decline think both of these are reasonable concerns but i don’t see either as being clearly worse than the other  primary argument i see against age restrictions is that “we should let the voters decide” and i think this is a powerful argument and why i lean against age restrictions and indeed other restrictions like “natural born citizenship” if voters think bernie sanders or joe biden is too old to be president they can vote for a different candidate if they think they’re still effective in spite of their age then they can vote for them that’s fine although i think this logic would apply just as well to candidates currently too young to run for president if alexandriaocasio cortez wanted to run for president in  and people thought she was too young and inexperienced they could vote against her for that reason is there any case for age restrictions well i think it has to boil down to a belief that the \\n“popular will” is sometimes suboptimal and can be influenced by irrationality or get stuck in some kind of bad equilibrium bryan caplan’s book the myth of the rational voter is a notable work making this kind of claim we’re accepting that logic we need to think is it more likely that these processes will lead to voters choosing a candidate who is “too young” or “too old” could make voters “irrationally” support a yearold for office a possible path could involve being a family member of a popular politician and then taking advantage of the “halo effect” of being betterlooking than older politicians a possible example of this has occurred with the kennedy family an entirely theoretical way this might have affected the presidency would have been if yearold ted kennedy had run and won the presidency in  after the assassination of his brother could make voters “irrationally” support a yearold for office probably the main reason is having name recognition from a long career i think joe biden could be a reallife example of this sanders also has it to some degree note i’m not saying that it is necessarily irrational to support someone who has had a long career  perhaps in many cases it’s a reasonable signal of experience but i think it’s more likely than other indicators to be somewhat shallow   we look at us history and that of other countries it seems to me that the latter scenario seems a lot more common than the former the youngest president was teddy roosevelt at  and the youngest elected president was jfk at  and to my knowledge there have been no plausible majorparty nominees under the age of  who might have won had the age restriction not existed  note that “irrationality” doesn’t have to mean that voters are necessarily dumb they might just be facing a collective action problem for instance i believe its possible that if all voters were given the chance to reflect and then could wave a magic wand to make either joe biden or eg amy klobuchar president the majority would pick klobuchar nonetheless marginal biden voters who want a moderate candidate risk that defecting to klobuchar would instead help sanders or warren so they largely dont in a world where biden was constitutionally ineligible to run klobuchar’s campaign may have done a lot better  issue could be “futureproofing” a second term imagine for the sake of example that either biden or sanders won in  then ran again in  they would be  or  respectively let’s say they had some noticeable cognitive decline could we trust them to step down andor lose renominationreelection because of this maybe but maybe not after all there’s been a precedent in the senate to reelect very old incumbents most notably yearold sturm thurmond in south carolina in  incumbent presidents almost never lose renomination and partisanship and “fundamentals” like the economy tend to matter at least as much as candidate quality in the general election it’s easy to imagine an almostsenile incumbent being penalised by voters for this but still winning then getting progressively worse over the fouryear term  i’m undecided about whether an upper age limit is a good idea i think “let the voters decide” is a reasonable argument but i think if you’re going to discount that i don’t think there’s a good case for there to only be a minimum age of ',\n",

       " 'cmv christmas has evolved past the confines of christianity and the cultural traditions so heavily out weigh the religious traditions that everyone should feel welcome to celebrate it regardless of their religion my point is basically that if you look at all of the christmas traditions the santa mythos the music the trees the cookies etc they extremely out weigh the actual christianity of it and because of that we should abandon the notion that just because you celebrate christmas you also have to celebrate the birth of christ and christianity instead treating them as separate but joinable entities you can celebrate christmas with or without the christianity of it and no one should feel guilty celebrating the holiday of their religion conflicts with christian views \\n example how many christmas songs other than “away in a manger” and “silent night” do you know that actually have to do with jesus now compare that against all the songs you know about santa there’s a lot more of the later you don’t see jesus in the malls and drinking coke with polar bears on tv  though most of these traditions have pagan origins the tree the lights etc we still associate the holiday with the birth of christ instead of the actual calendar land mark the winter solstice similar to how halloween arose to celebrate the fall equinox guess my main point is that we have this big cultural holiday that is  cultural but because of the  religious part of it a lot of people feel they can’t celebrate it and they take christmas out of schools and say happy holidays and avoid it  it should be viewed  is like thanksgiving where you would never think “oh i shouldn’t celebrate thanksgiving because of my religion” and you wouldn’t hesitate to put up finger turkeys around the office pumpkins on halloween or patriotic flags on the th of july  religious part should be a sort of subset or an add on where should you wish to celebrate the actual birth of christ on christmas you most certainly can but if you choose to celebrate christmas without acknowledging the birth of christ that’s also equally acceptable just put up some lights and leave out cookies for santa  there are a ton of christian christmas songs that was a bad example on my part that distracted from the point ',\n",

       " 'cmv you shouldnt be able to see how many upvotesdown votes a comment has until after you have upvoteddownvoted one of the most annoying things about reddit is how often comment sections turn into circlejerks echo chambers are harmful to rational discussion and should therefore be avoided it takes is five people to disagree with you for a comment to be hidden and buried which makes any comment that isnt in line with the prevailing orthodoxy effectively invisible having comments be hidden isnt necessarily a problem but what is a problem is how often comments get mass downvoted just because theyre being downvoted humans like to feel like theyre on the right side so they are extremely susceptible to group think and letting their opinions be influenced by popular trends so when someone sees a discussion where one commenter has  upvotes and the other has  downvotes they will be naturally predisposed to favour the upvoted comments the problem is of course that you dont know how many of those upvotesdownvotes were themselves people just following the trend so the issue just snowballs ive seen plenty of fairly reasonable comments get downvoted into oblivion one day and then the next day on the same sub a comment echoing the same sentiment might have hundreds of upvotes this is often a subconscious process since while we like to feel as though we are right we also like to imagine that we are rational freethinkers therefore i think a solution would be to have a comments score be hidden until you vote on it with a short time limit on altering your vote this way people would have to judge it independently and for its own merits and following the crowd would have to be an active and conscious effort rather than a passive subconscious bias i dont think many selfrespecting people would be willing to change their vote after the fact to be in line with the majority and people are more likely to stand by their own independent thoughts when they have to actively think about whether theyre letting others influence how they think',\n",

       " 'cmv access to cars has become ubiquitous and because of that and safe driving not being a priorityenforced many people dont take the responsibility seriously leading to entitlement dangerous driving and fatalities edit this has been super fun and had some really great conversations but im tired its my day off and i did this instead of laundry so i will probably not be replying any more i have given a delta because of this comment and have messaged the mods to make sure it goes through i also want to shout out this comment i might check in in a couple days to see if anything else pops up thanks all stay safe at bottom its the title context  i live in atlantic canada used to love driving couldnt afford a car when i moved out exclusively bicycled instead for the last several years recently got a good job so got a carshare and have been very surprised by how shitty driving is now that im an adult got my license at  and in retrospect i am horrified that anyone let me behind the wheel at that age the written test was a onepage piece of cake the driving test was brief and didnt cover anything difficult like parallel parking merging on the highway finding the turning lane etc  it boiled down to seeing if i knew what a flashing green was and whether i remembered to check my mirrors its been a decade and i have not yet been required to take another driving or written test  even if several of the local laws regarding driving have been altered driver training isnt even mandatory  if you pay  you can take your easy tests and walk out with a license to drive after doing it exactly one time city has had a string of pedcar and bikecar collisions over the last few years and so im seeing have many other places so many people have died or been seriously hurt and its being treated as a fact of life comments in the articles blame the victim as if the driver was inconvenienced in any way besides having to fix a dent i dont know the exact circumstances of these collisions but two humans colliding at kmh or even two bikes colliding at kmh is obviously a lot less serious than anything colliding with a car i dont think enough drivers are aware of the incredible responsibility you have when piloting a very heavy very fast machine and arent aware enough of the risks of not taking it seriously im seeing a lot of fatalities for pedestrians wearing dark clothes walking at night and this is often framed as their fault  when in reality doesnt it make more sense for the person driving the vehicle to drive slowly enough to be able to stop in time in lowlight conditions like nightime if theyre in the city shouldnt they slow at every intersection assuming an unseen person is there why is the onus on the pedestrian to own and remember to bring a safety vest or white tshirt each time they have to get somewhere after dark as car drivers we get the benefit of fast convenient travel  at the price of the responsibility of not hurting anyone i know in many situations the pedbike was clearly at fault this post is about the rest of the collisions ideas reduced speed limits in cities from kmh to more like  so people have more time to see and react to situations unfolding ahead and around them with stop signs and lights i cant imagine metro driving times would get significantly higher\\n heavier more frequent fines for textingspeedingtailgatingblasting through an active crosswalkunsafe passing\\n much longer and more indepth written tests focusing more on actual behavior than regulations like how bright your taillights should be in lumens for example that every intersection even if unmarked is a crosswalk or that if you cant pass a bike or ped safely with at least one metre of clearance you cannot legally pass no sneaking by\\n mandatory retaking of written test every six months with policy updated to keep it fresh allow doing this online make it open book the point is to reinforce these standards\\n much more involved and frequent mandatory driving tests im talking several hours for a couple of days every year or so in multiple road conditions wetdryfognight in multiple situations major highway rural highway rush hour in a city turning left against traffic safely exiting a blind drive and demonstrating knowledge of as many of the items in the written test as possible get that increased personhours in testing etc would be expensive  perhaps steeper ticketing by automated systems for the stuff above of course i know that no ones perfect including myself and that this is not about perfect adherence and more about a cultural shift and onus i think most irresponsible drivers would become better drivers if they actually had to im not hoping for anyone to lose their license unless theyve demonstrated that they are unable or unwilling to drive safely also know i dont have any real tested proposals this is just my experienceopinion im no policymaker and that this is getting into fantasy territory my view stands when thinking out this post i realized i cant even imagine a city that isnt smoggy noisy and full of traffic and cars and road rage and collisions and that scared me not sure how this got so long been building up for a while i guess i cut so much of this out ive been editing for two hours and im excited to talk about ittldr my view access to cars has become ubiquitous and because of that and safe driving not being a priorityenforced many people dont take the responsibility seriously leading to entitlement dangerous driving and people getting hurt',\n",

       " 'cmv hand washing facilities should be placed outside of bathrooms rather than inside washing your hands after going to the toilet is obviously a good thing to do the problem as i see it is that this relies on everyone washing their hands which we know isn’t the case if there is an inward opening door you have to make contact with the handle which is touched by everyone else  unless the stalls are completely sealed it seems that fecal particles can disperse through a room meaning that the tapsfaucets and any other surfaces are compromised  makes more sense to me that we wash our hands once we leave the bathroom so that we sanitise once we no longer have to contact shared handles or objects that share a space with toilets it would incentivise the nonwashers to wash because it’s more likely the handle will be compromised if no one has washed their hands before exit  ideal solution in my opinion would be to have hand washing facilities both inside and out as we may also use the sinks and mirrors inside the bathroom to shave apply make up and have the option to double wash  struggling to find any downside outside of the financial and architectural inconvenience i don’t really think they are significant enough to prohibit this as we accept these for other things when the inconvenience is outweighed by the benefit  my view',\n",

       " 'cmv neo gender identities such as nonbinary and genderfluid are contrived and do not hold any coherent meaning edit  yeah this has pretty much run its course now and im going to leave it here i just wanted to do this last note at the top to summarise my thoughts at this point\\n\\n  some people like me in the opening post define gender or gender identity as inherently of the relation between your physical sex and perception of self one thing ive gained from comments here is that what i might class as dysphoria isnt as simple as i had thought and some people have explained identifying as nonbinary or something other than malefemale in degrees of dysphoria or different types of it which i hadnt considered or been aware of so thats helped my understanding of those terms from that angle\\n  other people define and relate to gender strictly in terms of culture social expectations and their relation to the world around them they identify in nonbinary terms because of how they deviate from or feel those norms dont apply to them im still a little jury out in my mind on whether i would personally class that as a gender identity but its certainly been insightful in how these terms can be valid simply insofar as not everyone means the same thing when they talk about gender\\n  another thing that came from the above was numerous contributors made reference to other cultures which include genders besides male and female in some form to be honest without being an expert on each and every one of those cultures i cant really say to what extent thats relevant in the application of gender and gender identity in modern western culture and society i certainly take the point that it underscores how conceptions of gender can vary depending on when and where you are but that there may be other cultures which recognise three four or a million genders isnt really a point of contention to me or what i was asking people to change my view on because i was specifically asking about how people use those terms here and todayi mean unless youre saying what you mean when you identify as nonbinary is the same thing the navajo tribe mean by twospirit so i should read up on that im just not sure it really tells me much\\n  yes i still believe there are snowflakes in the world people for whom these labels are nothing more than a teenage fad or a way of claiming victimhood but i have also learned that assuming anyone using terms like nonbinary genderfluid femme etc falls in to this attentionseeking category is indeed a deep misconception on my part i was actually surprised at how little resentment anger offence or reactionary calling me a nazi took place for asking these questions in what i expected to be an extremely touchy subject i mean it did happen but it was very few people but it is one i wanted to explore and understand better the overwhelming majority of you were very friendly sincere and i got a lot of positive understanding and human engagement out of it very grateful to you for that\\n  my biggest outstanding question or thought on this is i still wonder to what extent the ever growing vocabulary around not just gender but broader identity is actually helpful as sociopolitical discourse i guess i think when you develop these increasingly specialised and numerous terms for identity characteristics whether intentional or not you run the risk of further dividing and segregating people boxing in their personalities to arbitrary labels and even pitting them against each in competition for recognition and resources and yet that seems like the opposite of what you would want to happen so yeah well i wouldnt blanket dismiss identity politics and advocacy based around identity as universally a bad thing i think it comes with a lot of caveats and is something you should do with caution to all who took part\\ngender identity in the mainstream until a few years ago was defined exclusively in terms of male and female the gender binary we also obviously had awareness of transgender people who experience body dysphoria an innate sense they were born as the wrong sex and in many cases take steps to live and present as the sex they believe they should be there are also a very small proportion of people who are clinically intersex which depending on what form and to what degree may or may not impact whether they can be distinctly classified as male or female of the above is a controversial change my view thing for me the existence of trans people and intersex people is self evident as is that they do not necessarily fit the distinctly male or female gender identity in which the vast majority of people fall recently however we have seen the widespread adoption in mainstream discourse of ideas like nonbinary genderfluid gender is a spectrum etc or even that you dont need dysphoria to be trans this last one is especially bizarre to me as i would say being transgender by definition requires you to experience body dysphoria i do not get to me it seems like contrived attention seeking either it does not really mean anything coherent or when people who espouse these views are referring to gender and gender identity they mean something totally different by those terms than i do example if i were to say my gender identity is male what i mean by that is the combination of the following two things i am physically biologically male and have the corresponding physical traits to that sex there is no disconnect between my body and sense of self no part of my body or its maleness feels wrong or like it doesnt belong to me as a self aware being trans person would say there is a disconnect between their bodily traits and sense of self a nonbinary person who is not intersex and distinctly physically classifiable as either male or female expressing when they say they do not feel male or female gender to me in that context is the relation of your physical sex to your identity so i dont see how its possible to have something in between only answers i have ever seen make reference to tastes personal preferences things i would regard as personality rather than gender i for example reject that not being a walking one dimensional s stereotype of your sex somehow amounts to holding a different gender identity nor do i see how that is even coherent as a concept youre a young boy who likes baking cupcakes and playing with barbie dolls that makes you a boy who likes baking cupcakes and playing with barbie dolls thats all youre a teenage girl who likes cutting your hair short putting on a hoodie and skateboarding great whats that got to do with anything wed refer to as your gender thats my change my view  explain to me what it means to say your gender identity is fluid non binary or whatever other neologism has been coined for it and how this is not just either a conflation of gender with personality or a bandwagon to claim a marginalised identity by people who are entirely ordinary huge thank you to everyone whos contributed its getting to a point now i cant keep up with or respond to all the answers ill keep reading what comes in but im going to have to largely drop out of replying at this point perhaps save the odd thing which particularly piques my interest  again thank you everyone some of the answers in this thread have been qualitative useful and given me a better and wider understanding of these gender identities and gender issues its very clear that many people have many different conceptions and views of what gender is how it relates to ourselves as individuals and the constituency of culture and society while i do still believe there are people out there who coopt certain labels and identities essentially as a form of attention seeking without any substance to it it is also clear that to many other people these identities have real significant meanings which speak to them in a way binary gender doesnt and which have been insightfully explained to that extent this post has been successful in changing my view and giving me a better understanding of other peoples perceptions and experiences want to finish by addressing one last point there have been a few accusations that the title and body of my post was rude insulting or disrespectful i wont apologise for incidentally offending anyone when that wasnt my intention but i will tell you that wasnt my intention i do my best day to day in my life to be empathetic to understand people to learn to grow to challenge myself my own judgements and perceptions by actively seeking out those of others which may be different and to reserve the right to unapologetically change my mind at any time new information or perspective convinces me i was wrong thats what i was trying to do here theres no point approaching that by holding back or being dishonest about what im thinking when i come in',\n",

       " 'cmv people incarcerated for marijuana related crimes in states where marijuana is now legal should be released there are many people who are currently incarcerated due to marijuana related crimes in states where marijuana is now legal it doesnt seem fair to them to continue to imprison them since the crimes they are being punished for are not longer considered crimes if they had committed the act that led to their imprisonment after legalization they would not be in prison although they committed their crimes while marijuana was still illegal if the legislature felt that this type of act should no longer be considered illegal all those who are in prison should also be released because the acts that they are being imprisoned for are no longer considered crimes  would help decompress an already overburdened prison system and seems fair to those who have been incarcerated for things that are no longer even considered crimes  could argue that although it is legal now when the act was committed it was considered illegal and so the punishment should be based on whatever the law was at the time this argument seems untenable because despite the act being committed at a time that it was deemed to be illegal times change and sometimes the legislaturejudiciary determines that certain laws were incorrect to begin with as an example if before  someone was imprisoned for being in an interracial marriage once the supreme court deemed these kind of laws to be unconstitutional it would be reasonable to release anyone imprisoned for such an act arguing that they should be kept in prison because interracial marriage was illegal when they got married would seem a very odd argument to make this doesnt match the values of the society as it is now and therefore these people should not remain imprisoned',\n",

       " 'cmv the normalisation of social anxiety is breeding social anxiety edit i must clarify that i do not believe this is the only cause of the rise in anxiety obviously as with almost every issue faced by the world there are many factors that affect global mental health start i have ocd and panic disorder i do not suffer from anxiety however i’d say i understand feeling anxious and suffering from a mental illness more than the average neurotypical person i’m not trying to ridicule anyone with social anxiety or any forms of anxiety disorder i am not saying that normalisation is inherently bad anxiety is a very real very valid mental illness people would most certainly still suffer from social anxiety regardless of if we had a label for it if people were vocal about their experiences  i believe there is a reason social anxiety seems to be the most common form of anxiety particularly in the current rising generations we talk about it nonstop social anxiety has been normalised to the point where it’s considered ‘not relatable’ if you don’t have it   out any form of social media and you will find comments making jokes about how they’re ‘too scared to order food’ or ‘too scared to answer calls’  youtube skits instagram memes tweets and such are centred around this it has become embedded into the culture i would like to state social media at this point for this rising generation  is clearly a given for each individual person to have and use to communicate effectively therefor it is not a sampling of only introvertedanxious people but the general population  believe the constant rehashing of social anxiety and the issues associated with it are bringing unfounded fears to the forefront of people’s minds they hear flocks of people say things such as “i’m too scared to order my food what if the waiter judges me” amp they in turn think “oh i’ve never thought of that will the waiter judge me should i be thinking about that” and rinse amp repeat with several social anxiety issues until these fears are imbedded in the whole populous has to be a reason that social anxiety seems to be growing so rapidly when other forms of anxiety are not to me it seems clear that is due to the normalisation of it suffer from panic attacks over a fear of being killed among many other things the fear of terrorism planes and general apocalypse level things is a common trigger for me i logically understand these are unfounded fears when i hear a particularly loud plane overhead and start freaking out i remind myself of this that it is my mental illness causing this fear that i am not in danger it’s just an imbalance of chemicals in my brain bla bla bla and instruct others to do so as well if they wish to help me it doesn’t always stop a panic attack but it certainly seems to shorten them or give me a sense of hope that they will be over soon it’s just my brain messing up someone is socially anxious there’s seems to be a culture of ‘understanding’ their anxiety like it is integral to make them feel supported and understood one must say “i understand why you might feel this way it is very scary to talk to the person at the cash register i’m here for you” or alternatively “i’ll do it for you” this seems like it almost takes their fears and in some way makes them reality for everyone around them like instead of blaming social anxiety on an illness it’s an accepted response to the world we live in it seems like this normalisation of the response to anxiety could be making these fears seem logical in the minds of people who otherwise wouldn’t of thought to fear some forms of socialisation want to make it clear i am not saying we shouldn’t comfort people with social anxiety or do any of the above i am not saying we should treat people with social anxiety that way that helps me i suffer with a different illness i am a different person things are different  am simply saying the reason the way we handle social anxiety right now is making it more likely for other people to develop the illness because it’s embedding it into our culture as a norm instead of as a serious illness that needs assistance i think this could cause a lot of troubles in even neurotypical people and could be changing the scape of what is a ‘normal’ fear  there is no other way to handle social anxiety maybe there is i’m no expert  just think neurotypical people should be on the look out to remember social anxiety is an illness and the worries of the mentally ill don’t have to be adopted by you work hard to resist the temptation that fear has on all of us i suppose  do you think social anxiety rates are stagnant maybe this is all anecdotal evidence change my view wording ‘growing’ ‘stagnant’ ocd is not a form of anxiety as of  as per the dsm please stop telling me it is in the comments regardless i was referring to gad generalised anxiety disorder which is widely recognised as manifesting completely differently to ocd even before they separated ocd and anxiety officially i think i’ve slight changed my view i don’t believe it’s the normalisation of the illness that cause it’s growth more likely the normalisation of unhealthy coping mechanisms avoiding socialisation etc that has spread to people who otherwise wouldn’t of found it socially acceptable to indulge in those behaviours i don’t think social anxiety is treated enough as a serious debilitating illness like depression and ocd are so people refrain from highlighting how absolutely dangerous it is to use those unhealthy coping mechanisms instead we just get memes about being to scared to answer the phone imagine if we were to get similar memes about cutting it would be a stark difference that’s not to say there’s anything wrong with joking about mental illness i think it’s important but it’s only a viable option if it is first taken seriously which social anxiety is not i’d like social anxiety similar to agoraphobia which is taken much more seriously but no one sees the avoidance of ever leaving the house as something to joke about instead of help someone get over',\n",

       " 'cmv the war on drugs is one of the worlds worst policy decisions does more harm than good and is ultimately pointless i know its not a controversial opinion but i want to see the other sides point of view war on drugs is one of the worst policy decisions in the countries that enforce them has led to a myriad of problems for society and is in direct opposition to the fundamental idea of liberty and the right to individual selfdetermination these problems include increase in crime war on drugs is primarily enforced by the prosecution of individuals who are engaged in the production sale distribution sale possession and use of drugs this automatically increases the number of people the government defines as criminals who in my opinion should not be considered criminals since drugs are illegal there exists a black market for them since there is a black market for drugs the people who would be business owners in a legitimate market now have to exist outside the law in order for drug dealers suppliers and cartels to handle market disputes they have to do it outside the legal framework this forces drug dealer and suppliers to resort to violence and murder in order to maintain their business this happens to any lucrative and unregulatedunderregulated business see the south african taxi wars  war on drugs also leads users who are caught with drugs to make their money in ways other than work if they have a criminal record as they cannot find work in the legitimate economy criminalization of a mentalpublic health issue addiction is a public health issue and people who are addicted to drugs are not criminals but often people who are suffering from mental health problems and selfmedicate using drugs in my opinion the way you help people with mental health problems is not by arresting them and putting them in prison but by giving them support and medical attention the war on drugs has made it more difficult for drug addicts to seek help has stigmatized their condition and criminalized their drug use making it more difficult for them to improve their quality of life and  often keeps them from being able to escape the cycle of drug use and addiction i do not think this is the best approach for mental health disorders that lead to substance abuse and is not only reducing the quality of life for drug addicts but actively preventing them from getting better violation of essential liberty war on drugs invades the essential liberty of all of us by stopping individuals from exercising our right to do what we want with our own bodies every individual should have the right to selfdetermination and should be allowed the freedom to do anything to their body even if it is harmful to their health it is not a crime to cut yourself drink alcohol or smoke eat unhealthy food and become obese or have unprotected sex therefore it shouldnt be a crime if you use a dangerous drug as long as the only person that is negatively effected is you  stunting scientific research war on drugs makes it incredibly difficult for any scientific researcher or institution to research drugs and how they interact with the human body since the brain is built on chemical signalling the best way to see how the brain works is to see the effects of chemical on the brain even through the limited research that has been conducted so much information on how the brain works has been learnt which can lead to better innovations in medicine and medical technology beyond that many of these illegal drugs have legitimate medical uses from medical cannabis to the psychedelic amphetamine doi having antiinflammatory effects drug assisted psychotherapy mdma for ptsd psilocybin for depression and end of life anxiety and ibogaine schedule  in the usa not only being used to help opiod addiction but also for the treatment of parkinsons disease making drugs more dangerous drugs are a prohibitive market there is no regulation as such drug dealers are not held to any legal responsibility for the purity or safety of the drugs they supply this is the main cause of the opiod overdose crisis in america using opiods as an example the most dangerous side effects of intravenous opiod use are caused by prohibition medically opiods can be used safely to treat pain and when used in a safe and ideal way they cause very few side effects not including addiction which is a mental condition and not a physical one and the damage to the body is minimal because heroin is illegal the alteration and misrepresentation of heroin is economically incentivized and has tainted the us heroin supply with fentanyl which is too potent to be dosed accurately leading to overdose as well as that the war on drugs has made it more difficult for intravenous drug users to obtain clean needles making the sharing of needles more common which increases the chance of infection as well as the spread of diseases that are transmitted through bodily fluids such as hiv the criminalization of drug users has made users more hesitant to call an ambulance in the event of overdoses for fear of being arrested for possession of drugs this is just one example the war on drugs is pointless issues would not matter as much if the war on drugs actually worked however the basic economic law of supply and demand as well as the inherent nature of drugs means that prohibition will never solve the issue but lead to an endless game of cat and mouse between drug dealerssuppliercartels and law enforcement even despite some of the harsh penalties for drugs the use of drugs has not decreased and all they have led to is suffering for drug addicts restrictions to scientific research and the handing over of a lucrative market to criminals though this is my opinion i want to understand why people are in opposition to the legalization of drugs so if youre for the war of drugs and opposed for legalization tell me why',\n",

       " 'cmv keeping psychedelics illegal only holds back research and doesnt actually help any of the causes the prohibition claims to first of all id just like to state the fact that i think a lot of this problem stems from how broad and problematic the word drugs is it refers to everything from coffee to heroin mushrooms to tylenol and im pretty sure most people agree that is too broad of a category to comfortably make blanket statements about understanding this a lot of people break things up into good drugs and bad drugs which is also completely useless because it always comes down to the person and the context a bit of mushrooms in a therapy session might be great for a terminal patient suffering from end of life anxiety but it might be horrible for someone with schizophrenia just like how sedatives might be good for certain people going into surgery but not for a depressed teenager with addiction problems my point with this is that its all relative and contextual refer to a specific subset of psychoactive compounds most commonly lsd psilocybin mushrooms dmt etc while mdma is not technically a classic psychedelic i will include it in the argument as most people do because of the massive amount of research coming out on its therapeutic effects similarities to psychedelic experiences and despite all this its status as a schedule  drug now i understand that despite the racist origins of drug prohibition in the west a lot of these policies are in place today not because of intentional malevolence but rather a continuing momentum from the past coupled with fear and a misguided attempt to keep everyone safe by prohibiting what youve been programmed to perceive as dangerous that being said it doesnt excuse the fact that the prohibition is not only keeping us from learning about an area of psychopharmacology which we already struggle to understand but its holding back research that could lead to breakthrough therapy capable of helping countless people therefor taking medicine out of the hands of people that desperately need it im not saying we should lift all prohibitive policy and fully legalise every psychoactive substance but what i am saying is that i dont believe it helps anyone having an all around ban on any substance making it illegal regardless of circumstance i would argue a large percentage of drugs that are illegal across the board have some sort of context in which their use makes sense even methamphetamine a drug thats dangers are widely known to most people is a schedule  substance under the understanding that there are certain medicaltherapeutic implementations for it so if we all understand how destructive methamphetamine can be yet we understand that it has its place how does it make any sense to place psychedelics in schedule  even if there are possible dangers attached even if you believe these substances are harmful and should have no place in society shouldnt we at least allow research into these substances to better understand them  if were being optimistic about the reasons they are illegal it would be because there isnt sufficient research they are possibly dangerous and keeping them illegal keeps them out of the hands of people who could possibly ruin their lives with them however psychedelics being illegal is the main reason there is a lack of research the lack of research contributes to the possible dangers involved in taking them and prohibition only creates a black market which doesnt stop anyone from doing them but just opens the door for research chemicals that are actually dangerous so how does sitting in ignorance of the subject help anybody thats my rant i feel like this is a pretty solid perspective but before committing it to belief id like to be as discerning as possible in finding holes in the idea using the help of you fine redditors im honestly open to whatever people have to say on the subject so please change my view ',\n",
       " 'cmv using race as a factor in us college admissions is under all circumstances wrong as a minority albeit one who gets the shit end of the stick when it comes to college admissions indian this is something that i have had a lot of trouble coming to a conclusion on hard to be a minority really really hard this is something i am unwilling to debate and will not change my mind on this matter i have suffered a great deal of racism and prejudice in my life just because i look different than most people even if im not considered by admissions officers as aggrieved enough to deserve a leg up because of this i know what its like to face discrimination as a person of color two wrongs do not make a right dr martin luther king dreamed of a country where his children would not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character this is what i believe america should stand for whether it comes to pursuing job opportunities making use of the financial system and also applying to college this in my opinion is nonnegotiable regardless of any good that this could have on society this is precisely why i have been so conflicted on this matter affirmative action has done a lot to benefit african americans latino americans and women in this country and having a diverse set of people on campus certainly has its benefits i am willing to acknowledge both of these but with all of the admissions scandals that have come to light in the last few months as well as the ongoing lawsuit against harvard i am beginning to lose my sense of compliance with the system this for example an admissions officer at harvard made the following note on an asianamerican applicant oh typical asian student wants to be a doctor nothing special here and then these people turn around and say oh we take all aspects of an applicants profile into account they are lying through their teeth shame on that officer i am sick of seeing so many of my friends and family face so much discrimination due to something that is out of their control we work so hard in life to succeed yet we are punished for being ourselves its time to draw a line in the sand viewpoint is as follows under no circumstances whatsoever should colleges take race into account when choosing to or not to admit a student nothing should compromise racial discrimination when it comes to college admissions if this negatively affects other minorities tough shit if this decreases the racial diversity of college campuses tough shit if this means that college campuses will be filled with a bunch of typical asians that want to be doctors fucking deal with it someone give me a convincing argument to think otherwise thank you everyone for your contributions id like to mass response with my opinions on some of the morediscussed topics eliminating legacy admissions im with this  statistically it might even completely solve the problem without anyone suffering discrimination even white people this in my view is probably the best solution right now\\n making up for centuries of discrimination doesnt matter the people in the present did not contribute to the wrongdoings of their ancestors its difficult because the people that need to be held accountable are dead but this doesnt mean we discriminate back against people who werent even born yet\\n why asians outperform other races has almost nothing to do with culture and mostly everything to do with immigration patterns\\n affirmative action levels the playing field so does abolishing legacy admissions so does improving public education so does getting rid of gerrymandering and racist zoning laws there are plenty of ways to solve a complex problem so a lack of creativity is no excuse for injustice\\n it’s not about disadvantaging asians it’s about giving an advantage college admissions is a zero sum game since there are a limited number of seats this means that you can’t lift one group up without disadvantaging another\\n its okay to disadvantage some people because they still benefit from their ancestors actions no its not its not their fault  you have changed my mind kudos to andoverian and photobummer for the proof by contradiction good job bit more about my background first of all im a grad student in electrical engineering thats taken plenty of machine learning and artificial intelligence classes one of the things that we talk about a lot is that ai while it seems like it would be more impartial than humans is not it is completely dependent on data collected by humans and humans are biased in fact theyre even worse than humans since for the most part they lack the capacity to have selfawareness that humans do mentioned this in one of the comments below and the ones that i just shouted out pointed out that this is precisely the reason why we need affirmative action because humans are biased and bias needs to be monitored this really connects the question at hand with something that ive spent a lot of time studying which is why this realization has hit me so hard perhaps im blaming the wrong mechanism after all what im really angry about is that asian and indian americans are being discriminated against but this is happening because affirmative action is being used against us not for us i believe that affirmative action should be used to remind admissions officers that its not okay to reject an indian student on as blatantly shallow of a basis of being a typical indian my revised thesis affirmative action itself is not the problem  its that it is not being used to combat biases against asians and indians you to every single one of you who contributed ive responded to many of you as i could the past day and have given deltas to those who gave arguments that genuinely gave me an interesting unique and convincing perspective but i am going to leave this case to rest for now im still passionate about discrimination and how it plays out with affirmative action and perhaps someday ill make another cmv regarding how asians and indians are treated in college admissions until then though im happy that we were all able to have this discussion',\n",

a terrible person and should not judge others i dont see why not as i believe every human has the right to judge and be judged what i am asking here is can anyone show me what is good in islam that justifies accepting or overlooking its harmful aspects i got a response the other day that put so much in my head i had to step away from replying  there is a great deal of variation within the muslim community in their opinions about these issues and closer analyses suggest that islam plays virtually no role in generating the distinctive opinions of muslims muslims are more religious than other canadians but nonreligious muslims are more different from nonreligious nonmuslims than highly religious muslims are from highly religions nonmuslims the effects of religion are not ruled out by the evidence uncovered in this paper but nor does the religiosity hypothesis emerge as a standalone or especially persuasive explanation for the patterns of opinions among muslimcanadians islam it seems is not “the problem” and efforts to curb the practice and visibility of islam  efforts which are well under way in some european countries  are unlikely to address the ideological distinctiveness of muslims even about social issues like gay rights and abortion yes this has succeeded in changing my view i no longer hate islam i hate muslims and to be perfectly clear this is not a violent hate it is a bottomlesslydisappointed hate like the bible or the book of mormon the quran is a book of fiction i already know that art cannot force people to act so how could i blame islam how could i blame a gun more than the one who pulls its trigger i had already known that american muslims are vastly different from muslims in other countries and it finally hit me that if the religion itself is the same the difference is the culture the people its the people who choose to identify as muslim who use it to justify their desire for peace or their desire for bigotry whatever is in their hearts islam is not the source it is the excuse now realize that what i feel towards muslims is exactly the same disgust i feel towards the fans of rick and morty who threw insane childish tantrums in public restaurants it is exactly how i felt towards the fans of avatar who convinced themselves that their soul is actually a navi and theyll be one again when they die it is exactly how i feel towards the fans of steven universe who ignored the core values of the show and bullied a fan artist into attempting suicide then turned against the shows creators when they were told to stop because they felt morally justified i am not making this comparison frivolously a religion is nothing more than a toxic fandom the only difference is how recently the central work was created embarrassing is that that after so many centuries these holy books could have passed into myth but they havent we can read aesops fables without insisting they are the only possible source of morality we can take the lessons of greek mythology without believing in the pantheon we can enjoy marvel superheroes without praying to them yes i know this is not an original thought but its only now hit me the enormity of it if the quran were allowed to be merely a book i would merely dislike it if i thought about it at all my problem is the people so weak of individual spirit that they need it to be more i entirely understand the need for humans to seek purpose but seek it find your own find it in other people how lazy to accept it prepackaged because someone told you heres all the answers you can stop questioning now watched star trek without calling myself a trekkie ive watched my little pony without calling myself a brony i dont make my enjoyment of those shows my primary descriptor i dont make it my life i called myself a mgtow for about a week i saw a video that explained it and i liked the concept of not letting other people define you then i took a look at the community and saw it was almost entirely broken bitter men complaining about their exes the community were not upholding the ideas i had been attracted to so i stopped calling myself mgtow i called myself a libertarian for a little while i read about it and thought its values lined up well with mine then i saw too many libertarians expressing support for anarchocapitalism this was not a belief i shared so i stopped calling myself libertarian because i didnt want something i dont believe in to be someone elses first impression of me have never in my life heard someone say  was the day i decided to stop being a muslim or the day of the pulse nightclub shooting or after hearing about the rotherham rapes or on and on and on what do i hear instead please dont blame my religion i dont anymore blame you the person who chooses to belong to it entirely understand the insidious family pressure islamic culture uses to keep people ensnared and the disgusting practice of murdering apostates but the catholic church was one of the most powerful forces in the world droves of people left after the reveal of their unspeakably evil systematic protection of child rapists and while the catholic church still exists as an entity numbers are strength and theirs are dwindling muslims could follow the example of catholics leave in such great numbers that the zealots cant kill you all they could if they chose to if you absolutely must keep that word branded on your forehead you could at least not let others decide how it makes you behave say this with a lot of pain id rather forgive id rather not hate this

       " 'cmv separate chess titles given exclusively to women should not exist first off heres some information for those who are unfamiliar with the chess world chess players are given ratings based on the results of the games theyve played the higher the number is the better the rating for every game played your rating will either increase or decrease depending on your result even for draws but less so for example if a  rated player beats another  rated player then the winner might receive a new rating of  and the loser might receive a new rating of  if however the  rated player beat a  rated player then their rating would increase by a larger amount and visa versa are roughly rated between  intermediates are roughly between  experts very roughly being  order to be awarded a chess title of grandmaster gm your rating has to be  this is unless you are a woman in that case you can receive the title woman grandmaster wgm at  may seem like a small difference on the surface but it is in fact significantly easier to obtain there are roughly  people in the world with a  rating or above whereas there are roughly  people with a  or above lowest female chess title is the women candidate master title which is rewarded at a  rating  is my rating if i was a woman i would have a chess title because i am a male however i will likely never receive a chess title unless i git real gud justifications for the use of separate female chess titles starting from the most stupid to the least stupid women are biologically at a disadvantage in chess is a perspective shared by quite a few high profile gms such as bobby fischer and nigel short showing that you do not in fact have to be smart to be good at chess the common argument is that mens brains are wired to be logical womens brains are wired to be emotional im of the opinion that theres just less female chess players than male ones ive read a couple studies that say females are rated similarly to males but theres just way less of them so of course theres not going to many women at the top if we took away women chess titles there would only be  female gms in the world then fuck it then therell only be  female gms in the world the rating system is based on an objective system that does not care about gender i want it kept that way its demeaning to give these fake titles women are socially at a disadvantage in chess argument actually has a tiny bit of credibility if you go to a chess tournament you will notice that  of the people there are men i can imagine how this could dissuade some women from continuing however you do not make progress in chess purely from chess tournaments its all done online now anonymous chess accounts its so fucking easy i got to  rated just from using anonymous chess accounts online they dont know my gender unless i state it theres so many learning resources to help without making yourself known youtube videos chess books practice online etc that i dont really buy this argument anymore especially as ive never witnessed any kind of sexism at a chess tournament before women should have more female role models in chess i said before it feels like  of tournament halls are men this is the case except for children it is much more equal for children i would estimate about a  ratio of girls to boys in fact my very first tournament opponent was against a  year old girl who i beat and flexed on her afterwards while she was crying i joke i won but it was very close seems that the number of female chess players will decrease significantly with age theres a number of suggested reasons for this  girls are not as interested in the competitive chess arena as much as boys  because chess online and in tournament halls are filled with men so they lose interest accept that but is offering chess titles to women barely rated higher than me going to change that no theyve been giving out female chess titles for  years now its not working take a fucking hint already it going to make guys like me incredibly salty when they have to pay £ to enter a tournament when female titled players rated the same as me get to enter for free because of their weakass title yes very much so but why does it even matter its just a title matters because these titles mean a lot to chess players ive seen people cry when receiving a title hell i would cry by giving chess titles to people at my rating it devalues the chess title also you get to enter tournaments for free and win prize funds so its basically a parttime job instead of a hobby when youre titled finally it opens the avenue for online coaching you can brag about it on your cv etc conclusion i know nobody outside of chess cares about this but i also know that if i posted this on rchess i would get downvoted to oblivion seriously all that sub does is downvote so i come to you no knowledge of chess is required to answer this give me a reason why there should be separate female titles this is a footnote from

       " 'cmv if you critically examine the bible like a movie script youd find god as a poorly developed character with inconsistent character traits and unexplained attitudes ive been thinking about how horribly the last jedi was written and how inconsistently the characters carried over their personalities from the force awakens and then it hit me what if the bible was examined in the same way thought back to the days where i went to sunday school and learned about god how god is supposed to love humankind to the point where he sends a part of himself jesus to endure physical suffering and make the greatest sacrifice in all of christian history but then it hit me why does god love humans does god choose to love humans if not can god have no choice but to love humans why does god exclusively love humans of course god couldnt exclusively love all humans since he had some humans kill other humans in his name so why choose some humans over others does he choose to love based on who agrees with him and what about the fact that god created humans last it is clear throughout the story of adam and eve that god can grant eternal lifesuffering and take it away in a moments notice this is the conclusion you get with the story of the fall where eve gets tricked by a snake into eating a fruit from the forbidden tree causing humanitys banishment from the garden of eden and subsequent physical suffering we have to endure  if god has the power to granttake eternal life and immunity to suffering why couldnt he create just humans first wouldnt he allow them to be immune to the effects of entropy hunger deterioration in a breathable atmosphere on an earth without anything but them and interact with his creation why did he have to create the other animals and plants first hell why did he even have to create light and a planet he couldve created adam and eve and make them immune to suffering a part of the story in the fall is that god gives adam and eve the capacity to feel shame when they notice that theyre naked they quickly cover themselves up so if he is also able to change the way we feel about certain scenarios another example would be the story of moses where god hardens the pharoahs heart then why couldnt he just create humans first with total immunity to death and without the ability to feel negative emotions in open space creating the animals first makes no sense whatsoever for a creator whose goal is to create something of his own image why would he start off with a lion or a serpent than start off with a human he is very tribal about it seeming to allow us to cause the suffering of his other creations by huntingkillingfarming them he rewards his followers and brings judgment against their enemies he gave his people the land of milk and honey he gave that jerkoff pharoah some desert pyramids and an asswhooping back to the harsh desert from whence he came he wanted these people to be happy because they are on his team yes god is very tribal he specifically chose us to love but he specifically chose to make us last this doesnt make any sense with the gods tribal character trait that is thoroughly described in biblical text why not make us first and just interact with us as he made everything else is this character who is this god that christians follow i need a serious change of view otherwise i could never take a christian seriously which would detriment my personal relationships with my christian friends so please change my view\\n \\nto the best of my understanding the purpose of religious faith is not factual correctness but emotional fulfillment the logical inconsistency of religious faith is in a way similar to the logical inconsistency of an irrational hope or to that of a dream that is to say its there but it doesnt matter that its there other thing to consider is that despite official statements to the contrary in the case of most people their personal faith isnt actually the same thing as believing everything in the bible is  true that is their religion may say so and they may themselves believe that they believe everything in the bible but for the purposes of examining logical inconsistencies its an important distinction\\n seriously didnt expect such great answers to come in so early this definitely changed my view and outlook on christianity christians arent inherently fools  they simply exercise their human capacity to be invested in something with emotional value my friends are definitely smarter than i am in many ways so i understand that they can be rational their irrational indulgence isnt something to be shamed but an indicator that they can be human this was a very fast cmv thanks ukilkil   alright guys thank you all for your lovely responses i mean no offense i do not mean to nor have i insulted you i genuinely appreciate the response but i will have to stop responding and place my attention elsewhere my stoned mind demands other content whether you are christian or atheist i am just happy that we can coexist peacefully   ugreatjasoni brought up a very objectively written plot element that actually provided some explanation for why god does certain things and how those could possibly lead us to discovering the truth about gods love there is an ongoing effort for the answer to the legitimacy of gods love that i hope christians will find one day',\n",

       " 'cmv america is the corrupted enterprise eisenhower warned about other than the sections of the speech below i think i can summarize my view shortly i served for just about  years in the navy as an officer over two deployments i shifted my view from one where the united states was ultimately a force for good to one where the united states is at base a hammer constantly looking for nails i was repeatedly disabused of my ideals of american foreign policy by the lackluster ideas of the senior officials i spoke with and the incompetent logic of the few admirals i had the luck to get into lecture rooms with one exceptionally frightening experience was listening to a minute lecture from an admiral on his belief that within a decade we would be in a shooting war with china this lecture was given in  short from these experiences and spending two extended maintenance periods in navy shipyards swimming with contractors i believe that americas foreign policy is no longer a force for good that an unwarranted influence exists between the military and its consequent industries and our government and that we do not have an alert and knowledgeable citizenry steering a proper meshing of the military industry and our societys peaceful proliberty goals my belief is that americans no longer have the ability to extract ourselves from the state of constant war that we presently have we will continue to expand our involvement internationally so that an era of peace will never again exist in the united states where all of our troops will be at home excepting our international bases and there wont be a looming clock of regularly planned interventionist deployments condensed the speech reads as follows full speech here \\n\\n    despite these holocausts america is today the strongest the most influential and most productive nation in the world understandably proud of this preeminence we yet realize that americas leadership and prestige depend not merely upon our unmatched material progress riches and military strength but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment\\n    progress toward these noble goals is persistently threatened by the conflict now engulfing the world it commands our whole attention absorbs our very beings we face a hostile ideology global in scope atheistic in character ruthless in purpose and insidious in method unhappily the danger it poses promises to be of indefinite duration\\n    \\n    a vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment our arms must be mighty ready for instant action so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction\\n    our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime or indeed by the fighting men of world war ii or korea\\n    until the latest of our world conflicts the united states had no armaments industry american makers of plowshares could with time and as required make swords as well but now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions added to this three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment we annually spend on military security more than the net income of all united states corporations\\n     the total influence  economic political even spiritual  is felt in every city every state house every office of the federal government we recognize the imperative need for this development yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications our toil resources and livelihood are all involved so is the very structure of our society\\n    in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the militaryindustrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist\\n    we must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes we should take nothing for granted only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together\\n    partly because of the huge costs involved a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity for every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers\\n    the prospect of domination of the nations scholars by federal employment project allocations and the power of money is ever present  and is gravely to be regarded\\n    another factor in maintaining balance involves the element of time as we peer into societys future we  you and i and our government  must avoid the impulse to live only for today plundering for for our own ease and convenience the precious resources of tomorrow we cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without asking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage we want democracy to survive for all generations to come not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow just wanted to put this link here because a few people got into it with me about whether or not the dod budget was too large they argued that military spending has been declining versus gdp for decades i pointed out that the public does not know the actual spending on the military because specops stuff is sometimes made secret and disappears from the budget i linked a wapo article from  its down there in my responses and today an article comes out about effectively legalizing hiding the military budget from the public hiding the dod budget made legal',\n",

       " 'cmv the united states is a very racially tolerant country this position will necessarily be stated in comparative terms i can certainly imagine some post racial colorblind society compared to which america would look positively dystopian but compared to whats reasonable to expect a country to be in  by comparing the us to other contemporary nations i think were actually a very racially tolerant country  it should be noted that our citizens are about as racially tolerant as they come some countries are our equal in this regard but none are really notably our betters most americans support diversity and again were one of the global leaders in that regard and our police forces often derided as extremely racist might actually be less racist than our not very racist general public or at least more able to repress whatever racial bias they do possess  like blm can give the impression that race relations are very poor in this country but id actually argue the opposite the mere fact that the vast majority of americans support blm and that tens of millions of us are willing to take to the streets in its names is proof of how deeply americans care about stamping out racism the fact that up to  of americans some  people are willing to go so far as abolishing the police entirely to help combat a tiny amount of police shootings that might have been racially motivated is frankly quite astonishing indeed im unaware of any other country that has dedicated as much social media and academic time and interest to studying the issue of racism in our society and how to best combat it one gets the impression that if black lives truly did not matter in the united states there would be no blm because nobody would give a shit about racial injustice  instead most people here do and im unaware of any analogous movements in any other country protesting the racial injustices that occur there if we truly were a deeply racist white supremacist nation then blm would have never gotten off the ground  there are racial injustices elsewhere racial disparities in things like wealth incarceration infant mortality etc are rampant across similar developed nations like the uk australia and canada as well as many countries that scored as just as racially tolerant across south america obviously such disparities are even more egregious in less tolerant countries like india did any of those countries start a blm type movement not that im aware of certainly none as large or notable or passionate the kneejerk reaction to that fact is to assume thats because racism is a worse problem in the us but perhaps its just because americans are more aware of our racist problems and more dedicated to fighting against them  obviously its asinine to think racism is over just because obama got elected but that fact shouldnt be trivialized either yes america has only had one minority commander in chief but thats one more than pretty much all our contemporaries can boast wheres the ethnically indian british pm wheres the native american leader of canada  while i do fully understand that we often focus on much more significant racial issues in this country the mere fact that we have the time and luxury to devote massive amounts of social attention to issues like the number of black oscar winners not precisely matching up with the demographics of the country indicates just how good race relations are in this country its fairly hard for me to imagine a deeply racist white supremacist nation giving a flying fuck about how many awards famous rich black hollywood elites are getting  often said that we need to have more conversations about race but do we granted ive only been around for a few decades but for as long as ive been aware it seems like were absolutely obsessed with the topic we talk about it all the time black history and various related racial injustices are major topics in us schools there have been countless articles and studies and books written about these topics documentaries and movies made special interest groups minority caucuses affirmative action grants and scholarships apologies have been issued and reparations paid tens of trillions of dollars and god knows how many man hours spent combating racial inequalities  not my view that just because i believe america is a very racially tolerant country that racism is therefore solved and there are no social frontiers worth fighting for i also fully recognize that arguably the only reason that were as racially tolerant as we are now is due to the heroic efforts of civil rights activists both past and present but i do reject the fatalistic defeatist depressing race baiting narratives of bestselling authors like tanehisi coates who paint a grim picture of an indelibly deeply and inescapably racist american nation  my view signing off for a bit will try to get back on later  whokay ive got about  essay length replies in my inbox awarded a few deltas and still trying to get to new responses but theres no way in hell ill be able to get to all these if youre looking to challenge my view i might suggest addressing one of the many people who are itt defending my position rather than leaving a top level reply i might not be able to get to  non ops can still award deltas thanks all',\n",

       " 'cmv reddit is the worst site for politics political congregations and political discussion cgp grey made a hauntingly prophetic video in regard to how emotions particularly anger manifests within large groups of likeminded individuals although it isnt explicitly stated in the video i believe that a way to diffuse much of the problem is by having both sides talk to one another talks story is far too long for me to go through but the essential gist of it is that once someone fills out a survey of their political views they get matched up with those who if they check the box to be able to talk to people that disagree with their views have different political views the project was an unexpectedly wholesome success and there are already expansions towards this concept is the polar opposite of germany talks like many other platforms reddit allows for the specified indulgence in particular communities that interest them while the first thoughts that come to mind would be relatively nontoxic hobbies such as the news gaming jokes and many others the isolation between said communities creates a literal cultural divide between subreddits with the only means of interaction between the two is through crossposting or organized brigades this isnt necessarily a bad thing as rgundam isnt remotely related to raccidentalitalian issues arise when communities that revolve around politics surface if you watch cgp greys video the anger germ doesnt get cultivated between two groups interacting with one another they get cultivated and get increasingly toxic in settings between groups of likeminded individuals sound familiar where they get angrier by stating their detest for the other side it sounds familiar to me these politics also spread and take over other subs with wildly different purposes while runpopularopinions used to be about well unpopular opinions now theyre a circle jerk hub of conservative viewpoints that arent necessarily seen culturally as popular in mainstream media rmurderedbywords is now a dilapidated retardation of rtrumproasts and rconservative and rchapotraphouse are toxic to anyone who doesnt exactly align with their beliefs is the subreddit ontop a shining hill confoundingly by actively encouraging participation on both sides however i believe that since the cgp greyeffect is in full swing people who lean on either extreme are disconcertingly becoming more and more unwilling to talk to each other because obviously the other side is a brainwashed moron who needs fox news or cnn to spoonfeed them fake news since they cant think for themselves i watched mr robot and it really says a lot about our society this leads to the trend of more and more centrist voices only participating in this sub which although i dont discredit centrist opinions is hardly a viable method for us to be able to congregate and discuss matters on political issues that concern us a selfpronounced conservative myself i get offended when someone attacks me of my viewpoint by generalizing me to fit a stereotype when they claim that they want to strip everyone from their stereotypes i get offended when conservatives become disillusioned with society with their few encounters with those with political opinions that are different to them under the guise of we just want to talk i get overjoyed when there are people like boyan slat who at such a young age created such a needed technology for our society and am unapologetically appreciative to people such as flat earth community who dare to challenge against the industryfunded research and are willing to even do their research themselves but if you bring up the good qualities of flat earth or even the antivax community whom id applaud for similar reasons and also abhorrently hate for other reasons in a discussion you immediately get downvoted and essentially for all intents and purposes suppressed because you dared to speak against the hivemind need more systems in place on our website which does have its good qualities to be able to encourage and cultivate programs similar to germany talks i dont have a system in mind posts like this or truth be told i looked around in my own traditionally conservative subreddits for an example to balance things out but its  am on a school night so ill let your mind fill in the blanks is not only unhelpful hypocritical but kind of pathetic now this this is good shit i would like to clarify a couple of things after receiving some helpful comments im unsure if my identity would be relevant at all to the

       " 'cmv arguing that historically oppressed people such as blacks cannot be racist only fuels further animosity towards the social justice movement regardless of intentions hi there ive been a lurker for a bit and this is a my first post here so happy to receive feedback as well on how able i am on expressing my views  many if not most people in the social justice movement have the viewpoint that the historically oppressed such as blacks cannot be racist this stems from their definition of racism where they believe it requires systemic power of others to be racist this in itself is not a problem as they argue that these oppressed people can be prejudiced based on skin color as well they just dont use the word racist  problem however lies in the fact that literally everyone else outside this group has learneddefined racism as something along the lines of prejudice discrimination or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that ones own race is superior google whatever their source is merriam webster and oxford all have similar definitions which dont include the power aspect that these people define as racism  there is a fundamental difference between how a normal person defines racism and how a social justice warrior defines racism even though in most cases they mean and are arguing the same exact point  these people claim in shorthand things like black people cant be racist there is fundamental misunderstanding between what the writer is saying and what the reader is interpreting this misinterpretation is usually only solvable through extended discussion but at that point the damage is already done everyone thinks these people are lunatics who want to permanently play the victim card and absolve themselves from any current or future wrongdoing this viewpoint is exacerbated with the holierthanthou patronizing attitudetone that many of these people take or convey  examples\\n\\n\\n\\n took these examples from a similar cmv post that argues that blacks can be racist    type of preaching of blacks cant be racist completely alienates people who may have been on the fence regarding the movement gives further credibilityammunition to the opposition and gives power to people that actually do take advantage of victimizing themselves while the actual victims are discredited all because of some stupid semantic difference on how people define racism  the movement should drop this line of thinking because the consequences far outweigh whatever benefits it brings fact what actual benefit is there to go against the popular definition and defining racism as prejudice  power i genuinely cannot think of one it just seems like an arbitrary change edit i now understand that the use of the definition academically and regarding policies is helpful since they pertain to systems as a whole  \\n this is a footnote from the cmv moderators wed like to remind you of a couple of things firstly please read through our rules if you see a comment that has broken one it is more effective to report it than downvote it speaking of which downvotes dont change views any questions or concerns feel free to message us happy cmving',\n",

       " 'cmv high schools or at least the th and th grade should allow for students to have more choices in the classes that they want to take and have less required classes \\ni’m currently a high school senior well i finished my work a few days ago so technically i’m basically out of school and i found this subreddit and i really wanted to see if people could change my view on this\\n since i was in elementary school i’ve never liked school i didn’t want to go to school because honestly i found it quite boring the highlights of my school day were talking to my friends and going to art class because hey that’s what i was interested in i will also just say that i do believe that a big part of me not wanting to go to school was simple kid stuff i’m pretty sure that lots of elementary school aged kids would have rather stayed home and watched tv colored played sports or whatever interested them at that age i’m only mentioning this because it kind of has to do with my argument\\n when we physically went to school i remember i was sitting in my calculus class while my teacher was lecturing and i asked myself “why am i learning this” as interesting as finding the slope of a line at a certain point on it and then using that information to find the acceleration of it at that point too i can’t understand how somebody in a non stem field would need to know how to do thisi will admit that this came from a place of laziness and boredom because i will be a computer science major in college and i may or may not be using calculus techniques and ideas but i thought about my friends that were going to major in english art or or even go to college why were they being forced to stay in higher level math classes to get the credits to graduate when they could use that same slot of their time to focus on something they’re actually interested in\\n know i’m about to go down the whole middle school meme route with this one like when the class clown asks a teacher when they’re ever going to use a certain concept in their algebra class in real life but i feel like they have a point they just don’t phrase it the right way i ask myself when am i going to use these concepts in real life i had to stop getting math homework help from my parents around my transition from elementary school to middle school because they simply just didn’t remember how to do it it wasn’t applicable to their daily lives it isn’t just adults that forget how to do concepts in school that they were taught it’s teens too i’m a year ahead in math but i can’t count how many times a friend has asked me how to do a concept they were taught in a class that i took last year and i’d respond with “you know i can’t remember” i think that this has to do with either me not being interested enough to know how to solve problems a year after i was taught or i never had to use it again so i cleared my “brain space” for something else\\n i went off on a slight tangent there i apologize but i ask again why are high schoolers forced to take these higher level classes that they have no interest in the most common argument i see is that “oh well they’re young and still in high school they don’t know exactly what they want in the future so we shouldn’t have personalized classes” i’d argue against that and say that by the time a student is in the th or th grade they have a pretty good idea of what they want to do in the future to add onto this many college students do end up changing their major so i don’t see why that argument only applies to high schoolers i feel like if we were not required to take as many “required core” classes we could instead take classes that seem interesting to us and help us explore different activities\\n of the classes that i think should be “optional” are super upper level math courses that will only benefit students if they’re going into a stem field and history classes that focus on memorizing little details instead of focusing on the impact on the world for example i believe that history classes that make you memorize when the byzantine empire was founded when it ended and what they did is highly irrelevant information for anybody not going to college for anything historical \\n\\n if anybody could cmv on this it would be greatly appreciated i’m always looking for opportunities to become more educated on certain topics and this is one i’m really interested in\\n first i just want to thank everyone who has given up some of their time to write such a detailed and well written response i promise that i’m reading them all even if i don’t respond to you there’s so much to read and i didn’t expect this to get so popular but yeah thank you all again i was thinking of giving out more deltas because some of you guys have such amazing responses but i’m not sure if giving out too many is suspicious it’s my second day on the sub and i haven’t really paid attention to how many deltas are given out per post  thank you to everyone that warned me about the amount of math in cs all i’m going to say is i’m glad that i’m good at math   yes i’ll continue reading all of the responses maybe respond to a few and i might

       " 'cmv the paygap in womens national football is fair unless specifically noted this post concerns the state of womens football in the us and europe statement of my general views on the broader social issue at play women have historically faced and continue to face unfair labor practices\\n there exists a general pay gap for equal work rendered in most industries though it is not nearly as large of a gap nor simple to calculate as the oftenquoted  per  earned by a man\\n i enjoy womens football and believe it has proven value in the mediaentertainmentcultural landscape\\n i am not persuaded by the argument men should be paid more for x sport because the worst mens team would still demolish the best womens team i hold this view mens and womens tournaments in the same sport are not equal work the la times compared sports teams to assembly line workers who unarguably deserve the same pay whether they put together a lowselling commuter car or a blockbuster highend luxury sedan but athletes arent skilled workers they are performers and their work is to entertain a specific audience the audience is the work in this equation both beyonce and justin bieber perform live music but they are not doing equal work even though significant portions of their audience may overlap in the sports industry revenue is generated not by the volume of goals scored but by the volume of people willing to pay to watch it happen and buy products branded to their teams and heroes the mens world cup in russia generated over  billion in revenue with the participating teams sharing  million less than  of revenue meanwhile the womens world cup is expected to earn  million for the full fouryear cycle  and dole out  million to the participating teams just shy of  of revenue factoring in the wwcs total team roster at  vs the mwcs roster of  the perteamperplayer revenue share is substantially higher for the womens teams claims that the womens team in the us brings in more money than the mens team is cherrypicked data  this is true for the past few years but over the long term the more established men’s game brings in consistently higher game revenue year over year revenue sharing does not scale linearly a fixed percent of revenue for both mens and womens tournaments is thus an unfair risk to the governing corporate body it pains me to say this  i hate fifa just as much as everybody in other words committing  of  million in expected revenue is a much greater financial liability than committing  of   billion molly levinson the spokesperson for the women’s national team said regarding their lawsuit “these athletes generate more revenue and garner higher tv ratings but get paid less simply because they are women”  the data disagree while the women’s team broke viewing records in the us during the wwc ratings for men’s games have been more than double those for women’s games on average since  according to nielsen calculations  excluding world cup games the men’s team’s ratings are almost four times as high the us soccer federation is genuinely good at rewarding top talent regardless of gender  according to figures provided by us soccer since  it has paid  players at least  million six of those players were men and six were women  the bestpaid woman made about  million from  to  while the top man made  million in the same period some women in the top  even made more than their male counterparts over those years to qualify for the women’s world cup  the united states women’s team plays five games in a single twoweek tournament the men’s qualifying road is a twoyear game slog across north and central america and the caribbean us soccer argues that the roster bonuses for successful qualification —  for the women in   for the men in  — reflect that a wage gap is seen near the bottom of the most paid list when separated by gender  the no  highest paid  female player made just under  and the corresponding male player took in  at no  the male player made  times as much as his female counterpart this is due to the fact that the mens team plays far more many games per year and are paid by appearance as they earn most of their income from their lucrative club deals to account for the lack of a profitable womens professional league in the us all attempts to establish one have failed thus far the ussf struck a deal with the womens players union to pay a fixed base salary to each player regardless of appearances  a comparable pay for play structure that is offered to the mens team would be financially devastating and unfair to the womens team talent roster the mens system results in higher average pay per player but this is a fair concession to the male players who receive nothing if they are not called to camp the lions share of a star athletes revenue comes from endorsement deals with private companies nike will pay an athlete pari paso to what it thinks it can earn from increased sales if the pay given to female athletes in these deals is unfair andor discriminatory based on sex we would need to see the value generated by such deals against what similar male and female athletes were paid afaik this data is not available further endorsement deals are entirely based on negotiation  what is fair or unfair is subjective to each individual deal and the parties involved there is good reason to believe that fifa undermarkets undersupports and underinvests in the womens world cup in their lawsuit the us womens team refers to this as a manufactured revenue depression but fifas failure to fully capitalize on the growing popularity of the womens world cup does not mean players are being paid unfairly it is not unfair to not pay players a share in revenue that doesnt exist because of fifas incompetence fifa has generally been good at increasing compensation to female players as the popularity and revenue of the wwc grows  last year fifa doubled the prize money for this summer’s women’s world cup to  million and has now pledged to double it again in time for the next edition in  the uswnts contract with ussf is up for renewal and they will do everything they can to further the rallying cry of equal pay for equal work to achieve its best possible negotiating position i do not think there is anything wrong with this other than they are rallying behind what i view as a false claim that the pay gap is not fair lets discuss i would very much like to change my view on this as i generally dont like to agree with angry voices on the conservative right but my feelings dont matter i want to know if the wage gap in womens football is fair or not my view is that it is fair and is on track to grow be even more favorable to the female players with the increasing popularity of the wwc but my mind is open word choice see strike through   wow this blew up there is a lot of great discussion here so thank you all i fully intend to keep responding thinking and doing additional research today i would like to dig around ussf data and see if i can get a copy of the uswnt lawsuit to see their arguments i will try to keep up as fast as possible so please forgive me if it takes a while to respond to every comment i also wish to work to pinpoint as many specific circumstances as possible that would cmv a big open question i have right now that may lead to some deltas is why arent players male or female commonly paid xx of revenue generated by a team or league   still working to read  reply to every substantive comment  take care of my day job  aslo i got invited to the cmv podcast going to speak with the mods now and accept   folks we have deltas to award changed and unchanged views to declare and a helluva lot more understanding of the issue to share and discuss i’m now ready to make a statement regarding women’s national football in the us i will continue to look into women’s football in europe as i do not yet have enough data nor analysis on this sector would love for anybody who knows anything about this to chime in terminology i use “national football” to refer to the national team that competes against other nations the paygap in women’s national football fair as far as the us is concerned my view currently remains unchanged however i also now believe that the current paygap is fair but unreasonable and it is in the best interest of the uswnt’s employer ussf and fifa to substantially raise wages  “quality of life” terms for female players  fiscal investment in the women’s game i’ve come to this affirmation compensation reflects all real andor potential capital value added to an organization by an employee against the upfront risk the organization must commit  my analysis considers all forms of capital including social marketing brand awareness brand value long and short term returns etc… the current cba between uswnt and ussf went into effective on  well after the usmnt meteoric rise\\n the next cba agreement will go into effect in  and it is incumbent on the uswnt to leverage their strongest bargaining chip public adoration changing social attitudes regarding working women public sympathy as much as possible to receive the most favorable terms\\n there is little to no risk for the uswnt to stoke public outrage and tie their claim of unfairness to the larger social issue of genderbased wage gaps\\n it has not been demonstrated to me that the work of the men’s and women’s teams meet the standards outlined by the equal pay act and equal pay act title vii and thus the heuristic “equal pay for equal work” does not apply\\n assuming the uswnt “quality of life” job benefits are unreasonably lower than the men’s eg no chartered plane travel frequency of games not played on natural turf etc… it has not yet been demonstrated to me that the lack of these perks is the product of unfair labor practices nor gender based discrimination\\n apples to apples a pure ofrevenue based wage for both men’s and women’s teams would be onthesurface fair but in practice would overwhelmingly favor ussf at the uswnt’s expense to this end the women’s player union has not argued for a pure ofrevenue model nor would their members accept one\\n for the past  years the us government office of the eeoc investigated the player’s claims of epaepa title vii violations at ussf and did not find sufficient evidence for government intervention note such findings does not mean the ussf is not in violation further the eeoc attempted mediation but these efforts failed\\n past discrimination of women in football does not justify greater pay prima facie\\n lack of similar negotiating leverage enjoyed by the mens team does not prima facie establish that the deal signed by the uswnt in  is unfair  similarly it does not establish that the deal is fair the increase in wages paid by ussf to the uswnt does however indicate ussf acknowledges that what is fair today is not fair tomorrow especially in the case of elite level performance this is evidence that the current wage gap is generally fair as it rewards the players for exceptional performance deltas to award… going to award deltas to users who changed my thinking andor prompted me to think about this view from new angles even if my overall view didn’t change delta goes to damejudyclench for doing the work providing a thought provoking comparable to consider tennis and pointing me to thought regarding systematic changes that lead to better pay for the womens teams that are not based on emotional appeal back to back world cups is a genuinely good idea worth considering also want to award a delta to a redditor who argued that the uswnt enters into each contract negotiation with hardly any leverage so one must be skeptical that the deal on the other end is fair to this end it caused me to think about what i consider to be fair play and it changed my sideview that outcries of equal pay for equal work from the uswnt were unfair and unreasonable i cannot find this comment because the thread has gotten so big but i mentioned that it was brewing a delta for me awarded to cargdad for showing me evidence and convincing argumentation that ussf unreasonably failed to invest in youth developmental academies for girls so much so that clubs established an unofficial development academy out of frustration if it can be demonstrated that had ussf not failed to established these programs that revenuecapitalvalue generated by nwsl andor the uswnt today would be substantially or substantively higher then i will cmv on my op toplevel claim excellent new sources i pulled including primary source documents norwegien model  an ‘equal pay’ model financials response expert on soccer in america  articles from legal experts at sports illustrated of uswnt lawsuit filings    wow holdontoyerbutts from out of now where with a stunner heshe linked to an informal poll of economists on this issue that just came out today question a in a case like the us women’s national soccer team where the revenues that they generate and their onfield performance both exceed those of the men’s team there is no justification for lower pay only  disagreed  going to reach out to a bunch of them to see if i can find out more about what brought them to that conclusion',\n",

       " 'cmv the glorification of victimhood andor marginalization status by some is a bad precedent for society moving forward over the course of the last few years ive seen an everincreasing push for the idea that those who have been victimized in some way shape or form should be propped up and promoted by society  while i understand the fact that this is all rooted in sympathy and in many instances has done great good for society the ideology behind it as ive noticed has grown increasingly rigid  its hard for me to put into words but basically the idea is that people blindly rally behind the less fortunate and proceed to push a narrative that because they are less fortunate society should do all that it can to rectify the situation idea is not inherently bad i dont believe but in many cases ive noticed that society sometimes writes metaphorical blank checks to those who have been victimized where if they have an opinion you are not allowed to challenge that opinion unless you yourself are a victim lest you hurt somebodys feelings  for example if two people are having an argument about say domestic abuse and one of the person has personally been a victim of domestic abuse then the common thread i see far too often is that even if the victim has incorrect or dubious claims as to the facts involving domestic abuse that social pressure dictates that you dont contradict them or youre an insensitive asshole also seen it arise in situations such that rather than helping victims it becomes easier or more convenient to shame or silence those who arent victims which is especially egregious when combined with intersectionality to assume who is and is not a victim based off of certain aspects  for example ive often been in groups of people friends coworkers fellow students what have you where when people bring up harassment or discrimination that theyve faced that when i bring up instances in which its happened to me im shut down with youre a man get over it or well youre white so it probably wasnt that bad and things along those lines as if because my group is not traditionally marginalized then im not allowed sympathy gotten to a point that sometimes people consciously play up bad things that have happened to them in order to extract as much pity as possible from a society in which pity ironically becomes power  rant aside the reason i think it sets a bad precedent is  the constant vying to be the most oppressed person in the room creates a culture where we constantly dwell on the problems in our lives because if you work past a problem and put it behind you then youve voluntarily discarded a social asset  this can create negative outlooks at best and cause situations in which individuals actively look for ways in which they can become victims at worst    it is a bad idea to run a society based off the views of the most marginalized to the exclusion of those who are not  should the marginalized have a say  absolutely  but everybody should have a say on things and if not everybody then the experts should  the thing is that being a victim of something doesnt inherently make you an expert on how to fix something anymore than being a perpetrator would  we shouldnt form our opinions on whether vaccines are good or not entirely based off the personal experience of that one mother whose child died because of a rare side effect of vaccination   and this is my weakest held argument just something that slightly concerns me for all of human history society favored strength and weakness was something to be hidden  it was unwise to bare your vulnerabilities lest they be used against you  a society which favors showing the world your every scar in order to gain social acceptance stands juxtaposed to the human condition and it worries me that at some point society could revert to the historical norm and all these vulnerabilities that people posted on the internet years ago be dug up and used against them this being said i am not against showing sympathy andor empathy to those who have suffered  i only take issue with taking things further and giving victims special social privileges',\n",

       " 'cmv race based affirmative action should be abolishedreplaced with socioeconomic based affirmative action i believe that race based affirmative action in college admissions should be abolished or replaced with socioeconomic affirmative action for the reasons listed below different topics will be listed by alphabetical letters and different contentions by numbers for the ease of reference i will abbreviate affirmative action to aa and underrepresented minority to urm all of my underscored texts are direct quotes from the linked source bit on my background i am around  pacific islander and  east asian i spent most of my  education at an east asian country i will refer to it as country x i have a dual nationality americancountry x i have been to  different schools from elementary to my current stage and i am now a college freshman relevant to given topic for reference i do not support legacy admissionsdonor advantage and i support athlete recruits i see it as merit based a mastery of physical education if you will social mobility i believe race based aa does not provide the social mobility some claim i have seen people argue that urms are on average on the lower end of the social class and race based aa would make the situation better now lets take  hypothetical students a rich white student a rich black student a poor white student and a poor black student now lets assume wealth is correlated to academic performance and the rich black student performs similar to the poor white student harvard can take in  students so who gets in most likely the richer white and black students as the rich white kid performs the best and the rich black kid and poor white kid have similar academic performance but aa breaks the deal and now if race based aa is replaced with socioeconomic based aa the deal breaker would turn in favor of the poor white kid thus achieving social mobility now magnify the four studetns into  groups of  different social class and  different race the same situation would apply  elite private schools would still fill up its cohorts with the  upper class groups while the  lower class groups remains rejected this is why race based aa does nothing to aid social mobility\\n in harvard and other elite private schools to a similar extent rich students outnumbering lowincome ones  to  quite the opposite of what you would expect for affirmative action isnt it this is inherently a statistical backing to  which shows that most urms in elite private schools would still be rich anyhow\\n most importantly combating social immobility cannot be done by giving a easier pass to college the poor black kid from  and the vast majority of those who are genuinely disadvantaged will never make it to the doors of elite colleges no matter what better education starts from elementary middle school and high school  reform the trashy public schools where a handful of people get pregnant every yeara big portion of the class are under drug abuse etc social mobility will not happen when aa benefits the wealthiest and resourceful of each race renowned berkeley philosophy professor john searle believed that race based aa was a disaster “there was a huge dropout rate of affirmativeaction admits in my classes by midterms” searle added “no one had taught them the need to go to class so we started introducing bs majors in an effort to make the university ready for them rather than making them ready for the university”\\n uc berkeley tried to give an admissions preference to lowincome students this device backfired however when it yielded a wealth of eastern european and vietnamese admits — not the kind of “diversity” that the university had in mind so the campuses cut their new socioeconomic preferences in half and went back to the drawing board\\n just to bring in some name clout martin luther king jr argued that a bill of rights for the disadvantaged would disproportionately benefit black people who “form the vast majority of america’s disadvantaged” at the same time it was appropriate for poor whites to benefit king said because they suffer deprivation if not racial discrimination “it is a simple matter of justice that america in dealing creatively with the task of raising the negro from backwardness should also be rescuing a large stratum of the forgotten white poor” he wrote campus diversity categorizing asians whites blacks latinos respectively into one single racialcontinent sized group is a completely foolish and lazy way of classification lets take the asian category it consists of indians pakistanis chinese japanese malays koreans indonesians taiwanese vietnamese laotians bangladeshis singaporeans a mix of its own hk chinese filipinos etc each of them with vastly different ethnicity anthropology history and sometimes even skin color of their own countries like vietnam hong kong philipines india etc were all colonized at some point and might have more similarity to their european colonizers than their neighbors quite ironic that the best anthropologists and historians come from the same institution that failed to realize such basic fact innit\\n building on  race  ethnicity if youre looking for diversity ethnicity is closer to actual behaviouralcultural diversity than race race refers to a persons physical characteristics such as bone structure and skin hair or eye color ethnicity however refers to cultural factors including nationality regional culture ancestry and language\\n building on  identity  ethnicity in essence your identity is what makes you unique from others your identity is probably the single most significant factor youre welcome to change my mind but at the same time identity incorporates social classenvironment ethnicityculture religion etc your skin colour is a subset of a subset of your identity and classifying diversity based on race is just again laziness\\n as i explained in the intro i have been to  schools in  continents from elementary to now as a college freshman most of them were in country x where i attended  local schools  privates schools and a private american school which is the most expensive one in country x while anecdotal my observation from my experience with all these different classmates was that no matter which continent i was in those who are richer and poorer behave similar to their own social class respectively regardless of their race my local school mates consisted of mostly lower and middle class and they tend spent money very very sparingly the spending culture of my private school mates was completely opposite they could afford to go clubbing every weekend some even started at  or  with fake ids while my local school mates never clubbed my private school mates were into netflix kendrick lamar giannis antetokounmpo etc while my local school mates were into baseball local celebrities localkorean tv shows anime etc my private school mates take usd per hour tutors student cram classes while my public school mates study on their ownattend lecture style  student per class cram schools in europe private school my school mates acted very similar to the rich school mates back in country x my point is behavioural culture of the same social class weighs more than that of the same race\\n ucscaltech do not perform race based aa yet i have never heard anything negative about their campus life with regards to diversity besides caltech being quirky due to its stem only environment berkeley is especially notable for being one of the most progressive institutions in the world and a diverse ideological pioneer of society why is it a problemfor schools performing aa racism ive seen arguments about how racist bullies prevent urms from excelling academics however the us today is definitely progressed enough for everyone to frown upon racists and hard core kkk style racists are generally widely condemned as for subtle racism it happens to all races to blacks latinos arabs counted as white in college apps asians rasianmasculinity and even whites dumb blonde jokes stereotypes exists for everyone and from my experiences with tons of urms and being a minority in country x racism is a taboo no matter how much of a pillock someone is also it is impossible to quantify racism so an admission guideline based on it would be too incompetent to reflect any realistic situation\\n race based aa stirs more racism a chinese friend of mine studied in a public magnate school in florida he was the valedictorian class president president of a few clubs officer of a student government in his local region nd place in local math competition not olympiad tho he got rejected from every t he applied to except upenn thank god he has a very passive personality but from talking to him i can tell that he still holds a slight grudge because a black classmate of his got into his dream skl ea but still applied to all kinds of ts on the rd round and he thinks that he wouldve had a good chance if the black student stopped applying after getting into his dream school he also strongly believes that the black kid got in to uchicago columbia stanford dartmouth etc over him because he is black not because of his merit or have a personality colleges are looking for i of course believe that it is wrong to place any blame atundermine the black student but the fact is my friends grudge and opinion about the black student was a combination of his believing that aa played a part and that there are quotas in his public school normally only  get into hypsm every year\\n on the micro individual level race based aa is indirectly racist towards whitesasians since if one worked extremely hard to achieve the academic performance and extracurricular but still fails to get in knowing that people who are less qualified get in because of their race it is only natural for them to feel imbalanced or even a target of institutionalized racism i have seen people on reddit claiming that they or their friends mischose their race then their offer got rescinded after contacting colleges the current race based aa is too incompetent to combat social mobility

primary school i am considering leaving teaching because i no longer feel that it is a safe working environment for a male quick background about who i am i need to mention this because it is our current cultural climate is very polarized im proud to say that i come from a nuclear free south pacific country i currently live in germany and see myself as european im a well traveled teacher of young kids so like most europeans like me we are liberal in other words to americans away from the coastal cities im pretty much a fake capitalist who is really a communist choose to teach young children because i find it the most rewarding job it isnt like i cant do other jobs i love addicted some say to learning so i also have degrees in geography computer science programming d movie animation padi divemaster and on top of that i am a lead designer of fully autonomous drones for a engineering company here in germany most of these skills i can use to make a lot more money than the low pay you get in primary teaching but i am who i am my personally suits working with small children i am the male teacher that children love  im often known as my favourite teacher in class they say i am strict but yell the least off all the teachers told that today from my head teacher who interviewed the children im a bit loony okay loony actor is my style i teach through positive reinforcement exstudents on facebook as teenagers or young adults always request me as friend and often thank me personally  im good at this job and each time my teaching has been officially observed i have only received excellence okay once i did get a good i know males are needed in primary school and it is my civic duty to help the next generations grow into well rounded people i am afraid im afraid that one allegation against my character will ruin my life i am aware of this i have taken training for male teachers on how to keep yourself safe i am never in a room alone with a child i will leave the room if the child wont leave i never walk alone just with one child i always make sure i do as much as i can to keep myself safe i am making sure the children no longer can hug me even though it is what they need and at the same time a tool teachers use to build a personal rapport with the child i try and fail still to leave the emotional parts to the female teachers the years i have watch how things have changed parents no longer trust teachers as they did only ten years ago its got worse i believe the brett kavanaugh hearing in the last  days has been my final tipping point quick note here remember im liberal european so kavanaugh judiciary practice goes against my core personal beliefs here  is a man who has worked in public office for over  years is a leader of hiring women in the courts has documented proof in the forms of in a calendardiary in who he met and what he did can get  women from his high school days to vouch for him within one day has written testimony from all those involved saying they have never met to go along with the calendar female friend choosing him to discuss their own sexually harassment and along with a lot more facts that can be proven yet in spite of having a clean history with support he has been accused of being guilty by the media celebrities and political leaders all before hearing his side of the story whats worse and the thing that is breaking the camels back is that the ordinary people who share my core beliefs were the strongest in condemning him and believing her before anything had been said on both sides now after the testimony where the facts were heard it is still seen as credible that he did something she provided no extra facts about that night apart from emotion yet when i read most of the media i see that they still support her scares me it scares me so much that i want to leave teaching im not brett kavanaugh i dont have records of my daily activities id struggle to find  women from school to sign a letter saying the nice guy i was in high school i was the geek loony guy  girls liked the strong sports type more hell ive got drunk and past out a few times and yes ive kissed a lot of girls ive seen how parents are i have noticed how the people i am around the most firmly believe her over him even when he presents facts to back up his claim is it really worth it one claim and no matter how i have acted what proof i have i have seen from this hearing and many more in the past few years that my life and that of my family will be ruined is the start of autumn holidays i love being a teacher but i am thinking of handing my notice in help me change my mind  please mention if you are male or female i am hoping it helps me see each gender perspective  thank you all for your comments i have enjoyed the discussion and it has given me many things to sleep over i will be back later to comment more but i am a father and being on reddit all day just as the holidays start i need to do other things yes

       " 'cmv parties are for politicians citizens should remain independent and register as such ill be using ‘we’ to refer to ‘we the people’\\nand ‘theythem’ to refer to those in positions of power\\n don’t always talk politics  but when i do i say screw both parties and usually the people i talk to agree whichever way they lean  they might have reasons for why this party is ‘the lesser evil’ but i haven’t come across many people who are genuinely happy with either party  if you are happy with one of the two parties id love to hear about it as an r or d is effectively voting ahead of time and publicly  your now in a category of person who is active politically and can be assigned a color your vote should be earned and you shouldn’t make up your mind ahead of time  your also being factored into political data which is used to strategize how to win a state or district and has moved away from anything remotely resembling a genuine presentation of political policy as independent is a far more effective means of protesting the two party system rather than doing nothing  a rising number of independent voters would affect the political strategy of both sides  elections are won by slim margins and a substantial independent voting block would make it harder to play the game and harder to play around the party lines they might even have to start saying what they really think but let’s not get carried away and liberal values are both essential for a healthy society and we should all be more open in discussing what each side is good at and bad at rather than blaming and demonizing the opponent  a third and better yet unaffiliated group would help to break up the back and forth  of essentially asking the politicians to change through protests we the people need to change how we interact politically and make them adapt to us  the redblue binary has evolved around our opinions and we need to stop giving out free information  you genuinely believe in your party and want to put your support out there i won’t tell you not to  but consider the tinge of inauthenticity that often accompanies public displays  publicly displaying your religious affiliation without being asked or beating some drum is often an attempt to gain attention and acquire affirmation to gird your own lack of faith or some other motive  keep your beliefs personal and private what you believe is best shown through action and it will become obvious if your words contradict them this country was designed around the idea that democracy requires citizens to be skeptical of those in power  skepticism should be your default  do not back a parties nominee simply because of their affiliation or because you’ll never vote for ‘the other guys’  we set the tone and the blame for this political divide can be laid at our feet for playing into it for so long  if a substantial independent block came out of the woodwork we would also have more independent politicians come out of that movement let’s change the narrative rise above the binary and claim independence from the two party system register independent don’t give away your opinion too easily or atleast keep them guessing to be a good op i’ve read most and appreciate the feedback wish i had more time to respond to each  i realize why we have two parties and how it developed i realize registering is a way to engage with your chosen party and have your say in the primaries and work with what we have in place  it is my position that our willing participation is being used against us to stay one step ahead of public opinion probably developed by trying to stay ahead of the other side or idk who or what started it but now both parties are deeply invested in controlling the narrativesand no i dont think this is new phenomena i’m not gonna dive into this you either see it or you don’t i’ve observed so far is that it’s pretty easy to guess where someone is at leftcenterright by the comments alone  i believe this is mostly because the two parties while not homogeneous are essentially adapted to appeal to all that we hold sacred depending on your personality a and b if you like  both sides do it  it has been beneficial to my perspective and how i examine politics as a whole to say ‘i am independent’ and i will assume nothing as best i can because i know nothing  i hear people assert republicans are by association or somehow inherently racist like it’s a given and plenty of people on the right think a lot of liberals are godless sadists who actually enjoy getting abortions  whatever the example you want it’s all fucking wrong extreme views are almost always wrong or oddities presented as common that person across the aisle is standing there because they believe in something that matters just like you do but we can’t seem to communicate about it anymore  we’ve divulged into a state of total noncooperation  the two parties are like the left and right brain two brains one body and they can’t communicate anymore that’s a problem choose to be independent because my conscience cannot allow me to be apart of this ‘pick your poison’ dilemma  i also cannot burry my head in the sand  this is a solution i see that helped me look at things with less bias and i’m not expecting it to be revolutionary or even new but we are all responsible for everything so just think twice about who you blame things on the easiest way to be completely and totally wrong about something is to be convinced you are right  also thanks for the insults toward my intelligence live long and prosper',\n",

       " 'cmv the idea of “believe all women” in regards to sexual assault doesn’t really make sense and or doesn’t mean anything so once again a claim of sexual assault has become a big story and this point occurred to me and i’d like to hear what other people thing  i dont understand why anyone would say “believe all women” or “we should believe women automatically” are you saying that there should be a different legal standard in sexual assault rape cases ie guilty until proven innocent if so that is an interesting if legally unfounded opinion if you think that we should take sexual assault allegations more seriously than that’s a valid opinion but ultimately if a woman makes a credible claim of sexual assault people tend to listen granted not always in the same way that people listen if you say you were physically assaulted in a practical sense if you go to the police in good faith and report a crime they have no reason not to believe you now again if the issue is that you think there is misconduct and a given case isn’t being taken seriously enough than thats a valid point and one that i’m interested in that said my main belief is that “believe all women” doesn’t really make sense and people should stop saying it besides that i would be interested to hear what other people think that phrase means or why it might be useful in discourse',\n",

       " 'cmv everyone should have easy access to painless death  of my view everyone above age of  so that they are capable of making their own decisions irrespective of whether they are mentally or physically ill should have an easy access to painless suicide probably by inhalation of carbon monoxide we already have the technology to do that so my only proposal is to make its access legal and easy for everyone my view does not advocate promotion of suicide this post is not prosuicide but rather prochoice and antipain in fact i would hope nobody would take the choice given to them however everyone should still have a choice are some of the arguments in favor of my thesis personal liberty\\xa0everyone should have the right to choose what to do with their lives as long as it does not directly harm others\\n euthanasia is not enough\\xa0the problem with euthanasia is it covers only sick people and the the government gets to decide who is sick thats not ok i am the sole authority over my life if i decide i would like to die no one should be able to stop me from doing so even if i dont have any problems at all in my life\\n problems currently\\xa0presently people who have decided to kill themselves have to go through extremely hard time to get it done jumping from building hanging are extremely painful and inefficient methods and has high risks of failure the consequences of failed suicide attempt are harmful to the person and their close ones\\n antipain over prolife pain be it physical or mental is single worst problem of humanity almost all problems on earth boils down to enduring pain we should try to eliminate pain as much as possible even if it involves letting people to die i believe lifes value is determined by the value people assign to themselves and not by government society and certainly not god\\n towards utopia \\xa0in an utopia earth should only be populated by those who genuinely wish to be here not and those who do not should have an easy and painless exit me address some of the arguments against my view myself so that you need not repeat it in the comments suicide is not ok\\xa0or any antisuicide arguments i have addressed this in personal liberty you can feel feel to hold your views but you should not be able to control other peoples views and their personal life choices i dont see a difference between antigay sentiments and antisuicide sentiments both of them are directed against personal choices about which the society or government has no business to choose\\n loved ones suffer because of the decision\\xa0i think this falls under antisuicide argument in first point yes they are affected but so are they if someone they love turn out to be gay go on a drinking spree hold a view that they dont and what not depending on the persons beliefs if someone they love has taken a personal decision they have no choice but to accept it this should not stop anyone to have the right to do whatever they want with their own body\\n its not your life to end it its your opinion you can feel free to hold it however if others disagree let them\\n depressed people are mentally unstable incapable of taking decisions i agree depression is a mental illness and cannot think as clearly as a normal person however i believe even they are capable of evaluating their own pain if they decide their pain is intolerable they deserve to have a choice to end their lives forcing them to stay in this world and making them to take therapy is inhumane denying the depressed people access to suicide because they cant think clearly is like forbidding a low iq person to manage their own finances because they are not capable of doing it\\n depression can be cured or whatever your problem is it can be solved well their problem may or may not be solved and they might even potentially have a happier life but it is irrelevant if they have decided they have had enough nobody should have a say in it just like nobody should have a say in how someone else should spend their lottery money moreover a potential happy life event a after cure of depression is not necessarily a better outcome than a painless death event b after death there is nothing nothing is just that nothing its not better or worse than event a on the other hand suffering is a worse outcome than a painless death\\n the proposal may lead to death due to rash decisions i agree it can happen it may even lead to a miserable lives for their kids or spouse thats why i think people should take the decisions responsibly which according to me they are capable of doing so i also dont think its easy to commit suicide psychologically despite making it easily available however if it happens we would have to live with it\\n easy access may lead to a suicide epidemic\\xa0i will not deny the possibility of this happening let me rather address the consequences of the event as i have addressed in point  supporting my view i think world is better off if less people endure pain even if it is under the cost of losing many lives while i do not believe it will happen i dont see a problem even if half of the planet decides to press the suicide button or even end of humanity said this i believe we should actively dissuade people from committing suicide and campaign them to live we should also help cure depression as we are already doing now however despite the efforts if they choose to end their lives they should have a choice to do it easily and painlessly',\n",

       " 'cmv serena williams sexism claims after losing the us open are not only false but also dangerous as probably all of you know serena williams lost the us open final to naomi osaka a  yearold tennis player from japan who won her first grand slam but what made it to the headlines was the outburst that the northamerican had after being penalized by the umpire carlos ramos in my opinion she was correctly admonished by the portuguese umpire who just limited himself to follow the rules to set some common ground carlos ramos barely misses anything from the matches he umpires so it is likely that he catches any coaching coming from any coach it is also known that ramos is known for being relatively strict in what comes to umpiring having given several violations to the most famous tennis players such as nadal djokovic murray and of course kyrgios and knowing serenas temper it would be predictable that had she gotten even the slightest heated up she would get at least a warning since she screamed at him calling him a liar and a thief and using the fact that shes a mother as an excuse which im still trying to figure out hows that an excuse i guess the outcome is far from surprising as for the racket being smashed theres really not much to say its a clear violation so even though it is arguable that he could have skipped some of his warnings the fact is that violations were committed and rightfully reprehended resulting in a one game penalty what i want to discuss here is the fact that williams turned this into a sex discrimination issue i think she has only done this because she wanted to find a way to justify the fact that she was visibly inferior to her opponent who undoubtedly deserved to win and also definitely deserved more praise following her incredible victory secondly i also think that she is better than all of this and that she was only caught in the heat of the final think it is a true shame that serena williams accuses carlos ramos of sexism acts of discriminating nature sexism racism xenophobia etc are unquestionably wrong and must be censured to its core as far as possible they bring dishonor and disgust to our society which also means that we should be particularly cautious in what comes to identifying this matters well this is exactly the opposite of what the  yearsold did she was not careful instead she found an opportunity to unduly play the sex card as a way of making herself look better after throwing a tantrum in front of her own people she had nowhere to turn and she chose the victimization path not only blaming her loss on the wrong decisions made by the umpire but also hiding her failure behind made up chauvinism claims without grounds far as my opinion is concerned this allegation is dangerous because it can bring hatred and more to carlos as well as lower the standards of what is considered sexism opening up a whole new discussion on what is and what is not ethic in what regards gender treatment this way some women may feel that they too can play the sex card for any minor adversity they may have even when completely disconnected with gender thereby the gender balance that all of us especially women are fighting for becomes uneven finish i think this has only got such worldwide dimensions since sexism is such a trending topic nowadays with womens selfassurance fairly getting more and more power and attention and dont get me wrong im all in favor of double standards and equal opportunities but it is important to look at things impartially and to have a critical eye on what is and what is not discrimination or else it may have drastic consequences especially when the main actor has the same influence as serena i think serena made this sexism thing up to find an excuse for her loss and we have to be careful not to call every little thing as sexist or discriminating or else we will all be little snowflakes that get offended with everything also as udontcallmeshirlie stated below theres one more thing to take into account does he penalize other women more harshly then men everyone keeps framing this as serena vs men  sexism if ramos penalizes women in general more harshly then men then yes thats sexism if it was just serena then i think sexism is a baseless accusation ',\n",

       " 'cmv reddit usernames that contain racial slurs should be banned warning i use racial slurs in the explanation of my argument black and the use of nigger on reddit makes me uncomfortable for obvious reasons hard r is objectively a racist term and is only used to make black people feel attackedunsafeunwelcome but im also uncomfortable with how popular use of the word nigga has become among what is a primarily white user base people dont necessarily use it in ways to make black people feel bad but they often use it for shock value to troll or because they think its edgyfunforbidden to me it really ignores the history of the term and is super disrespectful to black people on reddit that have said they find it offensive im sure a lot of people have a black friend that has given them the nigga pass but  if you ask that black friend  they would definitely tell you that the nigga pass is not transferrable just because you got it from one person doesnt mean you have it from all black people it is entirely fair for some black people to be offended by nonblack people saying nigga and for some others not to care this isnt a cmv about that if you want to hear my basic viewpoint on the matter check out this video by tanehisi coates again its not the focus of the cmv there was a great comment made on raita a little bit ago on a superficially unrelated thread that i think is just so pithy and useful for describing my feeling on how we should speak to each other online is this important to me i have never not once been able to identify myself as black on reddit without getting a deluge of private messages calling me a nigger not a nigga  a nigger telling me to shut the fuck up nigger nigger nigger nigger so on and so on reddit is on the whole a pretty cool place but it is not always welcoming to people of color since its not a place where people of color can always feel welcome since its a place where some amount of people not everyone obviously go out of their way to harass black people simply for being black on the internet it makes me uncomfortable that so many people are just throwing around the term on here like it doesnt mean anything one of the reasons why i have no emotional reaction to black people using nigga is because i know they dont hate me because of the color of my skin they dont think im dumb or violent because of my skin they dont think that i deserve less because im black i dont know that with people on reddit and every time i see nigga in a username or a comment is a small reminder of that of the fact that  if i mentioned this one small detail about my identity  id get a bunch of threatening harassing messages on a place that should be fun for me to hang out and look at dumb shit has started making an effort to curb the use of nigga on the site in ways that dont feature any overt racial animus rwaterniggas comes to mind i believe this should extend to usernames if theres a way to allow affected users to change their names instead of deleting their accounts that would obviously be preferable but if thats not possible i think the accounts should be deleted again i dont necessarily think that everyone with nigga in their username is a bad person but that word affects a lot of people in a pretty negative way and we should respect the history and power of that word you may have an argument to make about the changing nature of that word id disagree but theres an argument but to return to the comment i shouted out earlier theres a difference between being right and being a nice person not being able to use the word nigga in a username should not negatively impact the reddit experience for anyone and it would positively affect the experiences of quite a few for reading and responding i hope we can keep it civil and productive ive got to say that at this point this is the first time ive idd myself as black on reddit and havent been hit with a bunch of racist messages as of pm eastern on  i dont know if thats because people on cmv are cool or if its because this isnt a super popular post or both but its cool nonetheless that being said ive got to get some sleep but ill hop back on tomorrow i will say though that a lot of the argument has been about whether or not nigga is offensive and not about the point i made that reddit has started quarantiningbanning subs with nigga in the title and they should similarly ban account with nigga or other slurs in the name i hope im not coming off as not being able to change my mind im trying to be as open as possible  okay i know i said i was logging off an hour ago but i came back on to respond to a couple more people now im logging off if you can please avoid making more what about this word arguments for starters its already been made like twenty times in the comments below but on top of that i dont know if they really address the issue at hand im enjoying the chat though i hope you find it interesting too  holy crap this blew up overnight for starters we can nix that whole cool i didnt get any racist harassment thing i got less than usual but a couple of classy fellas felt the need to remind me that im a nigger overnight second im definitely not going to be able to respond to everyone but ill try to hang out for a bit and see if there are any deltas to give out im starting with the bottom since toplevel comments have already gotten quite a lot of attention edit thanks to all of you that replied this seems like its starting to snowball and im getting  notifications every time i refresh theres no way for me to keep up with everyone but ill post a quick rundown here there have been a lot of what if hypothetical responses that have strayed away from the main point reddit doesnt allow these words in the titles of subs and that should extend to usernames too \\n weve talked a lot about the slippery slope which is not inherently fallacious but i believe that it has been used in a fallacious way pretty frequently a lot of the logical consequences of banning niggernigga in usernames that are being discussed are actually not all that logical nor do they address the point of this cmv im not talking about the legitimate gripe that some people have with the word eskimo thats a different discussion\\n i gave a delta that was removed for some reason to uscottcmus comment saying that though i find it problematic i think the suggestion that reddit create a feature that automatically hides usernames featuring slurs that individuals find offensive is a viable solution that is different from my original proposal try to keep commenting throughout the day but its pretty overwhelming at this point again thanks to all of you for for the most part engaging with this cmv in a productive way and if youre someone who insisted on taking time out of your daynight to message me calling me a nigger or to tell me in the comments to stfu you dumb nigger  i dont know think about your life

       " 'cmv tipping leads to worse service im from an european country but have also lived in us for a few years im not going to argue whether tips make sense as a practice or economically just how they effect the quality of service  is commonly believed that us waitstaff goes out of their way because of the incentive that is the tips but here i will argue that this actually only makes things worse for the customer here is what tipping leads to\\n overbearing service from fake cheerfulness to constantly having them at your table its just way too much realistically there just isnt that much that a regular waiter can do aside from taking your orders and as long as they are polite and not slow the service is good if you try going above and beyond you actually end up harassing customers in europe the staff leaves the table alone until called  rushing the guests  another negative side effect of having staff constantly at your table is that your pace is dictated by staff who want to clear the table for the next tipping customer i on the other hand enjoy the relaxed atmosphere of european restaurants where you can take all the time in the world to uninterruptedtly talk and enjoy your drinks or meal at any pace  lack of sincerity  among the customers are introverts who like to be left alone and extroverts who like to chitchat and connect with the waiter neither profits from fakemoneybased friendliness of an us waiter you dont actually know if they like you as a person and you suspect no one is that enthusiastic to serve you in europe wait staff isnt over the top and treats you like person to person but when you instigate small talk and get along you know its genuine\\n putting value on the customer  for a system that prides itself with great service i find us waitstaff quite rude and exploitative if youre a customer who doesnt intend to spend too much in europe you can gather some coins walk to a pub or a coffee shop ask for the cheapest something and then sit over it for as long as youd like in us this is considered wasting your waiters time and it wasnt until i learned about the mentality later that i could explain why i got such weird reception after saying this i also find it rude that if the client can tip only within the lower end of norm they are also considered or treated as assholes and many americans think these people should not go out at all at least in europe you never meet this sentiment and you can be a cheap customer without any negativity the main reason why us staff hates cheap customers is also that cheap food means low tip even if you calculate the good percentage its sad that poor people are seen as wasting time and space if they want to go out by same servers who expect customers to care about their financial situation \\n all these reasons i think service is better when it doesnt directly financially depend on each individual customer but when servers can instead just focus on doing their job if the service is really bad which can happen in both systems customers can still complain to the management or not come back at all providing good service is still part of a job description and like any other profession being bad at your work can still get you fired put you in a bad spot with your boss customer experience is better when they arent seen as a dollar sign',\n",

       " 'cmv you can refuse to accept someones identity and still treat them with respect and believe they should have human rights so big mistake rather than accept i meant believe meaning you can refuse to believe someones identity and still treat them with respect and believe they should have human rights because accept implies coming to terms with someonesomething and if you cant come to terms with someones identity then you probably cant respect them things first i believe transgenderism and non binary is a thing and believe being born in the wrong body is a real issue and transitioning is so far anyway the best method for fixing it just felt like it was unfortunately important to make my position on this clear when it really shouldnt be imo especially in this subreddit been getting a sentiment for a while where if you dont accept someones self identity you simply do not respect or feel they deserve basic human rights to say its mostly from leftist andor lgbt community but might have other people too i think have been getting it from when ever left or lgbt says transgender people are being denied their human rights they almost always point to someone who believes there are  genders or transgenderism doesnt exist and somehow that means people who identify as non binary or are transgender they are literally not human and dont deserve respect or human rights for starters i dont thing being accepted as what you identify as is a human right its only a violation of human rights when humans rights as we know are being violated in other words you identifying as say some animal and other people not accepting that identity isnt a violation of rights its only when people start treating you with the same contempt as an animal brings me to the respect part i also believe that you can treat someone with full respect as everyone else but still not be on board with what they identify with because i honestly dont see why not ̶i̶f̶

issue or continuing to use the wrong pronouns on a person after being told to use the correct pronouns is not disrespectful however i believe it is again let me stress this enough deliberately using hehim on someone who politely asked to be called with sheher is disrespectful why because its not your business to try anything other than basic respect for a random person sure if she was someone closed to you might strike up a conversation about it but if its some random person all you can really do is remember the pronouns that heshe wanted to be addressed by now if you cant remember thats fine but atleast you are trying and thats respectful the main point is to just get by the daily lives of you and that person and anything that gets in the way is just no good for either person someone who thinks hes a alien and hes not and goes to a therapist for help how is the therapist is going to helpaddress that persons problems will he straight up say it to his face hes not a alien or will he say he is what he is and leave it at that no hes going to respectfully say you are a good and sane person which he is with the exception of identifying with a alien but you are just mistaken on your identity and ask him how he got there in identifying as a alien if a therapist can be respectful with someone who identifies with something they are not why cant your average joe thats what i wanna know obligatory holy shet this blew up overnight i would try to reply to as many comments as i can but im afraid i will not be able to reply to everyone out of the  comments now that is out of the way clear up some misconceptions and answer some of the most asked questions disrespectful to indulge in someones delusion what is the alternative in trying to be respectful tell them straight they are not what they perceive themselves as or strike up a conversation about it right then and there regardless of the time or the place or theres something else im not getting disrespectful to not believe in someones identity what are you supposed to do to respect them genuinely believe them right then and there from deep within or like the above halt everything you are doing and discuss it with them or use your own time to research it and change your mind on it just to respect them if thats the case then frankly thats asking for a bit too much for basic respect imho but feel free to cmv even on this im not very good when it comes to making up post so maybe there are some grammer issues here and there and some points left out so just bear with me   even thought it may not look like it i had the assumption that respect is a conscious effort meaning you can always respect someone as long as you want however that is not the case because you can unintentionally disrespect someone as well however i dont think that is too big of a change because you are bound to disrespect someone one way or the other regardless of what you do  given to the person who made me realize i been using accept the wrong way  i believed how you came to think of a certain group has no bearing on you respecting them whatsoever but someone made me realize if you believed something negative about a certain group just by reading only a few articles instead of being a little skeptical it would mean you didnt hold them to much respect because we tend to not regard the feelings or rights of people we are quick to judge i think edit phew lots of good points across the board but i think my view and the way ive presented was both a mess because first i think i been conflating everyday respect with genuine respect for a person and the way ive presented also gave people the idea that i believe refusing to accept  that is  refusing to come to terms with a person is somehow respectful so i think ill call it quits now this is only my nd reddit thread anyway out of the years of lurking around so i was prepared for a bit of mess but maybe this topic just got out of my hand',\n",

to respond im trying to listen to everybody but youre all writing interesting and longthoughtout posts so its becoming increasingly difficult i just want to clarify for the new readers ive basically yielded that white is not really an important word in my prompt there isnt much i describe below that singles out white men its more of a men thing in general i also want to clarify that i am almost entirely determined on voting for blue candidates this fall the prompt should be read as im begrudgingly voting blue for sure but worried that blue doesnt care about me many of you have already expressed that this is a systemic shortcoming of a twoparty system  not necessarily a specific targeting or lack thereof thank you all for your input and ill try my best to continue replying  guys im really sorry  this blew up to an extent far greater than i can respond to im not trying to ignore newer posts and im sure there are others who are lurking to read what you have to say but im getting flooded here im very thankful for that but it also means most of you probably wont see a reply from me im very sorry havent had a cmv post this large before  had no idea how overwhelming it can get thank you for all of your different perspectives it helps a lot  some this probably sounds like the most privileged post youve ever heard to you id say im sorry because im really not trying to upset anybody but rather express a frustration i very dearly want to vote against the republican party come this midterm just for a quick snapshot of my political opinions i want tighter tax doctrine imposed upon corporations and the wealthy coupled with lower taxes for submedian income groups i want overseas funds to return from these corporations\\n i want a political party that doesnt take corporate handouts hahahahahaha and doesnt spit on the likes of the homeless\\n i want socialized healthcare and socialized higher education\\n i want nuclear energy with supplemental wind solar hydroelectric and geothermal\\n i want lgbtq to feel as welcome and wanted in this country as the rest of us\\n i want a clear pathway to citizenship that gets everybody paying their taxes and able to access affordable healthcare and the other perks of citizenship i want the children of the immigrant families returned and i want the people in charge of the horrible shit that has happened to them brought to justice\\n i want a foreign policy that is warm and trusting of the eu  nato and standoffish against russia\\n i want men and women to continue to step forward to unveil the horrible sexual scandals that have been occurring in the entertainment industry and elsewhere i want these pieces of shit brought to light and i am happy to see a guilty persons entertainment career torched because of how they treated their coworkers and the general public can continue but i just want to get the point across that i really do intend to vote for a leftleaning candidate however my frustration is that i do not feel welcome by this party most recent democratic presidential candidates including bernie sanders hillary clinton and barack obama have been guilty of using the same centsonthedollar statistic to describe a problem that has nothing to do with centsonthedollar clinton and obama both have discussed in their respective campaigns troubling statistics such as suicide rates or incarceration of women while glossing over how disproportionately fucked men are in these categories politicians and citizens try to assign discrete weight to every social issue the issues facing white men can go on the backburner or be ignored because someone else has it worse\\n no democratic candidate in the past two general elections to my knowledge has ever summoned statistics such as the suicide gap the horrendous state of us divorce and custody trials the terrifying way in which a false rape accusation for a college  graduate student likely means the end of their career domestic violence against men  lack of public resource available to help abused men etc if they ever said something about problems like this my guess is that they said it in passing sandwiched between a statistic about women and a statistic about lgbtq i imagine they avoided these issues because they would probably correctly feel that they would be cast out as democratic candidates for failing to pass muster here\\n with sarah jeong still holding her seat at the new york times and the nyt being a usually leftleaning news source its pretty clear that leftist media is not afraid of being racist toward white men or at least they are not afraid of being controversial when it involves white men but stay away from woman  minority controversies like the plague\\n any time a white man discusses the issues which are specific to white men they are considered either racist redpillers or both i think this point is incredibly dangerous because if a leftleaning voter feels cast out by their own party you know who they want to go to jordan peterson and ben shapiro and all of those fuckin guys telling them that theyre right to feel frustrated because blahblahblah and then you know the far right has their own perpetuated narratives too and none of its good bernie sanders was in my opinion a very strong egalitarian candidate but hillary clintons team coupled with some bullshit editorials from the wapo and nyt calling bernie supporters bernie bros was all it took to torch his campaign that is a pathetic weakness for a political candidate on the national stage\\n the republican party has essentially installed a catchnet for any democrats who fall out with their party over controversial social stuff trump may be a madman but if he and his crew are the only people talking about the issues that white men face who the fuck do you want someone who is concerned about the lack of concern for white men to go think a major weakness of the current state of the democratic party moving forward is that they demand  loyalty on social issues and have completely abandoned an organized fiscal or foreign policy plan democratic candidates can rise and fall in an instant depending on whether or not they made a rude comment to a secretary during the primaries but if clinton feels hawkish against russia or wants to abandon  trash some key trade deals thats all fine according to her voters as long as she talks about wage gaps she can be whatever type of diplomat she wants a major strength of the current state of the republican party is that theyve leveraged themselves in such a way as to capture dissent within the democratic party when voters inevitably fall out just want a candidate that gives equal airtime to every demographics issues i want someone who acknowledges that everyone has major fucking problems and not try to continue a narrative that the furthers the goals of a particular group only the left does a very good job recognizing the bullshit lies and narratives that the right commits against their own voters but are you fully aware of the shit happening in your own party do you want to see what happens in a court when a female teacher has relations with a male student do you want to see what happens when a virgin with a  at harvard gets accused of raping a woman i understand that you need to say some things to appeal to each voterbase right so if you make a pit stop and give a  hour speech in a hispanic community you need to make mention of some hispanic community issues and what you plan to do to fix them thats just what makes good political sense where is the democrat candidate making the same appeal to men do they care are we supposed to accept that nobody gives a shit that men get wrecked disproportionately in divorce cases false rape accusations occupy the majority of prison cells and are the majority of homeless underestimate the voting plurality of white men  old men divorced men bored men picture this voter a man is on the hook for child support often times even when the woman earns more money a man fails in the majority of custody cases his life has been ripped away by a vengeful woman he is pushed into a deep depressive state with suicidal urges he hears from the wapo how female suicide rates are rising while not a peep about men or how close he was to pulling the trigger yesterday he hears from vox how the patriarchy does mysterious dare i say deep state type shit all the while a woman and a female judge just took his life away where the fuck do you expect him to vote theres a red candidate whos a little extreme on guns mind you but hes the only one who told him his problems matter dont want this to be a red midterm and lord willing it isnt going to be but for fucks sake people how many more

       " 'cmv nothing i can do will meaningfully contribute to ending climate change and pollution hello im writing this because this is a rather pessimistic stance and i really hope someone can change my mind think that for some reason people seem to enjoy antagonizing themselves we are the ones causing climate change we are the ones killing the polar bears and walruses and penguins we are the reason why plastic is in the ocean and why  the rain forest is depleting i dont think its an individual issue if i were to cut out meat entirely stop purchasing anything made of palm oil only ever bike to school and never purchase anything made of plastic or with plastic packaging climate change would still be happening it might help slightly but not in the long run i am only one person people say that everyones actions will add up but i dont think that many people will ever sacrifice their current lives to save our planets future companies alone are responsible for  percent of global carbon emissions this shows that pollution is caused primarily by companies and corporations not by little people like you probably or me sure if everyone stopped buying toyota cars theyd probably stopreduce their emissions of carbon and drop off the list but i think its rather impossible to get everyone on board for that they will keep contributing to climate change whether they have  million customers or  million or even just  million america beautiful is a good example of where my opinion lies kab was created in the s by people like the pepsi and cocacola ceos theyre the ones that coined the term litterbug and fund beach cleanups and similar events i think this is rather despicable really rather than taking responsibility for the huge amount of plastic they manufacture with they shift all blame to individuals like you or me why should a bunch of people like us have to clean up the ocean for kab due to a problem almost entirely instigated by kab last thing i wanted to touch onthe self antagonizing stuff is especially bad for those of low incomes even if i wanted to cut out plastic and stuff entirely i along with what id argue to be most americans couldnt afford to ecofriendly products are typically much more expensive than standard ones cotton clothing is often much more expensive than clothing made of polyester dont think that using an led bulb rather than fluorescent or skipping a shower every other day or boycotting everything made of palm oil is really going to do anything this mentality is harmful not only for antagonizing people with low incomes but for shifting blame off companies and onto average people voting is a good start to solve these issuesholding politicians accountable for keeping companies corporations and net carbon emissions in checkbut i cannot yet vote hence the title nothing i can do overall though i think the solution isnt for us to take responsibility but for those with power to hold corporations and companies responsible please change my view and if there is something i can do that meaningfully impacts climate change please share that with me woah thanks so much for all the insightful comments and great discussion ive never had a cmv or post like this and i really appreciate all of the conversation right now thanks to you all ive changed my view to something like its good to strive to act environmentallyfriendly via recycling conserving energy etc as its the moral thing to do and ones actions may influence others alone nothing i can do will meaningfully contribute to ending climate change and pollution or create a longterm change however by acting as a unit with others and placing pressure on others a larger impact may be made framing climate change as solely an individual issue is still harmful not only for antagonizing people with low incomes but for shifting blame off companies and onto average people voting and lobbying are perhaps the best ways to combat climate change at this point that and not having kids didnt expect this many comments and i have homework to do so it might take me a while but ill try to reply to everyone thanks',\n",

       " 'cmv girlsonly math and science competitions are counterproductive and do not help to encourage more girls into these fields currently math and science tend to be much more maledominated than other fields and this seems to be the case in mathscience competitions as well competitions like the international mathematical olympiad imo are usually disproportionately male dominated to the extent that one or two girls on a countrys team is enough to make the news to encourage more girls to enter competitions like this and to encourage interest in stem there are some competitions like the egmo european girls mathematical olympiad that are open only to girls  find this counterproductive because i dont see the reason why creating a competition only for girls will actually help encourage them into math and science separating by gender can give people the incorrect impression that girls are less able than boys in these fields and therefore require a separate competition to get anywhere at all only reason i can think of for why a separate competition needs to be created for different genders is when significant physical differences would make a combined competition unfair which is why physical sports are separated by gender but in academic fields like math and science i dont see any biological reason why someone with xx chromosomes should be predisposed to be worse in stem addition since the population is close to half and half male and female a competition limited to one gender would probably mean less people take part  so the fact that there are fewer people in the female only competition will mean that standards are lower overall just because there are fewer people in the competition  like if you take the fastest person in a large city and a small village the fastest person from the city is statistically more likely to be faster than the village person because there are more people in the city so the probability is higher  may mean that the girls only competition may be perceived as secondrate or at a lower standard and wrongly stigmatise girls as being less able in math even though it isnt the case which is counterproductive to the original intention',\n",

       " 'cmv affirmative action is bad policy even from a progressivesjw perspective generally arguments against affirmative action are levied from a conservative sometimes racist perspective those against aa generally deny the existence of systemic racism or historical injustice against black people in the united states opponents of aa also tend to look down upon its recipients believing that they dont deserve it would consider myself a progressive i acknowledge that historical injustice and systemic racism exist however i am still against aa as a policy for two main reasons  it doesnt use progressive values to approach social justice and  there is insufficient evidence that it is effective policy action isnt progressive two foundational progressive ideas are that race is a social construct and social justice should be viewed through an intersectional lens keeping these two ideas in mind aa is not a very progressive policy\\n race is a social construct that is the most scientific way to look at it even from a less academic more practical standpoint it makes more sense to view race as a social construct some black people look hispanic some hispanics look black other hispanics look white indians can look hispanic or black depending on the season the fact that we lump east asians and indians into the category of asian despite them looking nothing alike or having little to no cultural similarities should make you question the way we view race in america at one point in american history irish and italian immigrants werent considered white and were called white nwords so even the category of white isnt fixed\\n if you accept this premise that race is a social construct then racebased aa becomes very complicated it becomes very difficult to gauge who deserves aa why do hispanics who look white receive aa when indians that look black do not what about mixed race children indians irishmen italians ethnic jews chinese and japanese—while they werent enslaved like black people—faced massive discrimination historically and in some cases are still victims of discrimination today yet these groups dont benefit from aa at all\\n intersectionality is the idea that social categories such as race class and gender are interconnected and combine to create unique levels of discrimination and privilege this further complicates the role of aa why should white women benefit the most from aa should nigerian immigrants who are arguably the most successful ethnic group in the us and whose ancestors have not been victims of slavery in america benefit from aa it could also be argued that it is unfair not to consider class why should a white female student coming from an affluent family receive aa over a white male student coming from a destitute family what about transgender students should a trans male receive aa because he is trans or because he wasis biologically female or should he be seen as having male privilege action is not effective the stated goal of aa is to address racial inequality by providing opportunities to marginalized groups that have been squandered by historically racism andor current systemic racism i dont believe there is sufficient evidence to suggest that aa is effective policy for achieving that goal one of the most comprehensive studies on aa concludes that its efficiency is ambiguous at best and the redistributive effects may not be large given that aa has been around for over  years and its effects are ambiguous at best i feel like it is safe to say it is not effective\\n an analysis of  studies on aa suggests that it can perpetuate negative stigmas so not only is aa not very effective it can also be harmful i see aa as trying to use a bandaid to patch a severe laceration it may or may not help but there are more effective ways to deal with the issue of social injustice also implementing aa without committing social injustice in the process seems very complicated when considering intersectionality and the socially constructed nature of race solutions imo end the war on drugs blacks use and sell drugs at similar rates as whites but are  times as likely to be incarcerated for drugrelated crimes ending the drug war could end the mass incarceration of black and brown men in america being raised in a singleparent household is associated with more juvenile crime worse educational outcomes behavioral and emotional issues etc less incarceration could mean more intact families and better outcomes for black and brown children\\n improve access to abortion and contraceptives this can also help combat teenage pregnancies and reduce singleparent households\\n dont fund schools from property taxes poorer often black neighborhoods levy less property taxes which leads to underfunded schools education should be the great equalizer but this system amplifies inequality between the rich and the poor\\n i believe these solutions unlike aa are closer to targeting the root causes of the racial inequality in america today that being said i am not a policy expert these are just some of the many potential solutions',\n",

       " 'rchangemyview is graduating reddit introducing changeaviewcom tldr reddit has been a great incubator for the rchangemyview project but we’re very excited to announce that we have built and launched changeaviewcom now in beta in order to take things to the next level  those of you who have received or given at least  delta during your time on cmv follow these instructions to add a “legacy badge” to your cav profile we hope to see you at change a view\\n what’s this about  cmv has come a long way since its creation in january  i never could’ve predicted its growth to  subscribers the team of passionate moderators keeping things in check nor the many genuine connections made here every day between people willing to listen and learn from each other as the subreddit has grown weve matured and so have our ambitions  was the perfect starting point for this experiment but we feel strongly that our positive contribution to public discourse would be better served by having the freedom to forge our own path this is why in mid i decided a “cmv ” was necessary and shortly formed a founding team with alex projectwatt creator liz longtime cmv moderator and jon udeltabot developer to begin development of changeaviewcom cav  may be wondering what exactly inspired us to expand outside of a subreddit—i’ll go into detail below for those who want to better understand the original motivation behind cmv and now cav please read our mission\\n user experience  moderators we don’t have much influence on how reddit works most of the time that makes sense—imagine  active subreddits existing for wildly different reasons all getting their wishes when it comes to the fundamental reddit mechanics while we had concerns that the reddit redesign was favoring quickconsumption content over longform discussion and led a group that raised these in a proposal named “design for discussion which the admins engaged with us on we ultimately realized that reddit had made the necessary design choices for its needs our needs we understand are different we continue to enjoy reddit and appreciate that it afforded us an opportunity to learn and grow this period of time was undoubtedly a catalyst for pursuing our own ideas and design philosophy we’ve known for a while now that we’d have done many things differently if cmv had been built from the ground up instead of within the reddit mould for example the purpose of voting would be redefined and ranking mechanics would reflect this the delta system would be fully integrated users could filter content geographically or by category we would make dramatic moderation improvements that cascade down to the user experience and many other cmvspecific features would be added  has made this all possible and much of it has already been built but rather than continue to develop privately towards perfection we’re now ready to share this journey with you as we continue to improve the website including a feedback area dedicated to incorporating your thoughts and critiques \\n moderation experience deserves its own section reddit’s mod tools are perfectly fine for probably  of subreddits but we have very specific workflows and recordkeeping processes behind the scenes of cmv that use various “hacky” solutions tasks that take  clicks copypasting and two browser extensions for us on reddit are now completely streamlined at cav removing friction and saving moderators time ensures quality at scale this matters as any cmv contributor will know because what we do here only works if our rules and standards are consistently upheld built a public moderation log with the intention of allowing those who seek it out to verify that content removals are justified we trust our moderators but understand that transparency in this area is mutually beneficial sometimes mods may still need to redact sensitive information from the public modlog—in cases of ‘doxxing’ for example also plan to make the moderation team led by brett cmv mod ansuz a much more structured and valued part of the overall organisation our moderators are involved because we want them to be we think humans need to be in the loop and even though we are building partnerships to automate some moderation use cases we want people looking at difficult scenarios and setting coherent precedents for us this is a feature not a bug and why weve spent so much time developing quality moderation tools\\n\\n perspective api collaborated with jigsaw and have integrated perspective api into cav’s moderation in addition to user reports perspective is used to increase the speed of our human moderation by flagging comments that may break our rules so that moderators can review and make the final call we will continuously work to improve the efficiency and quality of cav’s moderation to keep the conversation productive and inclusive\\n future plans cav isn’t just about improving what we do today but also having the capacity and autonomy to take opportunities and branch in new directions as we evolve we have big plans some of which we’ve made a start on that will require more resources than we have now to fully execute—concepts like integrating with education providing private cav areas to organizations and a widget to facilitate twoway cav discussions below external articles we also expect to eventually introduce a paid subscription on the public site for users who want some extra servicesfeatures the website isn’t monetized today but hopefully these ideas will generate the revenue necessary to make this project sustainable—we’re determined to avoid the need to display ads \\n let’s go change some views hope this announcement has been informative—as you can probably tell there’s a lot to cover

       " 'cmv in christianity and all its denominations the bible portrays god as immoral and unrighteous and preistspastors who try to explain otherwise only give weak and fallible arguments i am a roman catholicish i went to a private catholic high school for some time i received first communion when i was seven and confirmation when i was six and previously went to bible school every saturday night to learn about the bible and mass i dont necessarily believe in the god that has been presented towards me in fact i dare say i dont know what i believe in as of currently however my belief in god does not change the argument that has been laid down now that the exposition of who i am is out of the way let me explain my position  off i am not attacking the christian church nor its practices though i do have strong feelings towards american christianity in specific this claim is only  referring to the holy bible itself i could even extend this argument to judaism and islam as they all share the same beliefs of the old testament at least generally  where the majority of my argument will reside  want to get out of the way a few counter arguments that i will not find acceptable arguments that priests have given me in the past god is a nonhuman being therefore does not need to practice human morals is a claim that god is a higher being then humans themselves that he is one that humans cannot begin to comprehend one that is in a completely separate category then humans are and therefore because he is higher then us it is his right to treat us accordingly to his will if it is true that god created humans and also created the moral laws in which humans need to abide by then by humans standards if god breaks the moral code then he is being not only immoral but hypocritical and the hypocrisy factor is what adds the second layer to why god breaking his own law is morally impermissible any arguments that say god is always right because he is omniscient or anything similar is a logically circular argument and is question begging  when god is seemingly mistreating you it is simply a test of your faith  is a claim that states that god never really has any negative intentions in any thing that he directly or indirectly does but he instead is testing your will and faith towards him by discomforting the human testing faith is not something to be done with pain and if faith is tested via harming or causing the other person discomfort or pain then it is immoral because it uses the person only as a means to your personal ends kantian bias if when in a relationship one of the partners decides to test their significant others faith by pretending to cheat on them or trying to get them to cheat on you via seduction it is immoral so why is god morally allowed to harm humans to test their faith and my answer is that it is not god is right morally permissible even when he is wrong a logical standpoint this makes no sense and is flat out wrong in a black and white standpoint something cannot be true while it is also false however i will entertain the idea that the meaning is more of something is right even when it seems to be wrong which is a logically acceptable statement my counter argument for this is an argument that is not very strong however i find it stronger then the initial argument of gods rightness itself and that is that we as humans even under god have the right to have a collective subjective opinion towards what is right and wrong and this why we study ethics and because god claims to give us free will though this also disputed and we have the right to believe in a human subjective opinion therefore we can obviously distinguish what decisions are and are not morally permissible even at a godly level  that was not the point of the story of how the story ends or what the story means i want to claim that god acted immoral in some way or another to receive some sort of teaching by the end of the story regardless of how the story played out i believe that some of his actions are  in one way or another  morally impermissible therefore the moral of the story plays no effect in my argument  to my main argument which is that the bible portrays god as immoral for this im not going to cite specific quotes as the translations and differences in religionsdenominations all slightly vary instead i want to allude to some of the bibles stories itself i also want to point out that  the story of abraham and isaac this test of faith story goes that god asked abraham to sacrifice his son isaac in order to prove this faith to god now many religions have extremely different interpretations on gods intentions of the sacrifice but i will not go that far into the story as to share its moral the story ends by god or an angel stopping abraham from killing isaac and offering up a ram instead  gave humans a rule specifically to not kill anyone however it is apparently morally permissible to break this rule iff god himself gave the divine command to do so this in itself is not only hypocritical but also morally impermissible by gods and humans rulings god had no reason to ask for the attempted murder of one of his children there are other more righteous ways in which god could have handled abrahams faith other then asking for the murder of his son regardless of what his intentions are to asking the task the story of job is a story that i bring up a lot and get the that was not the point of the story argument job was a man who had faith in god and lived a good and wealthy life with many kids and was in prosperity to test his faith god made a deal with the devil be it was apparently the devils idea rather then gods but i dont see as to why that matters that the devil may do anything he wanted to job in evil to test his faith to god whatever the devil does it cannot kill job himself  ends up happening is job losing everything his family was killed farm brutalized and his wealth evaporated but in the end of the story job gets everything back because he stayed faithful to god through hardships  reason i find this morally impermissible is that god was the one who indirectly caused these hardships again with testing faith god made the decision that he will serious f up one of his followers lives for the pure reason of seeing his reaction towards it another step is the question of if job hadnt stayed faithful to god would god have punished him even more for well for being punished by god god used his follower his child as a means to his personal end game in a deal with the devil which is morally impermissible contradictions in the bible is not a specific story this time but contradictions of different points from around the bible to set up this argument i want to make it clear the belief that god has complete control over humans meaning that he has the ability to affect their lives by either creating them in a certain way or affecting a certain condition  the discrimination against other religions  if god indeed created each child and had control over humans in the first place why birth any children to other religions why let humans tickle the possibility of other fake gods if god is to do this and allow this then he must also not discriminate over the belief of false gods as he was the one who had complete control of the creation and the spreading of these religions \\n the discrimination of other humans  homosexuality disputed women and those born with lesser then others or in unfortunate circumstances a leper should not be treated differently by god nor judged differently as he created them \\n thou shalt love tho neighbor as thyself except when x y z disclaimer this is only for christianity as it is only portrayed in the new testament not my strongest argument as it derives sources from both the old and new testament but the main argument is that god tells to always love your neighbor however commonly contradicts in saying that others are okay not to love  list of noncomprehensive argumentsexamples for the sake of time god wiping the world void from moses though he does feel remorse for this action\\n god punishing eve even though he knew that eve had the capacity to sin as he had created her\\n killing egyptian first born sons during passover \\n god killing half a million people in chronicles\\n god killing people because people were complaining that god was killing too many people\\n killing wife and children for worshiping other gods\\n forced cannibalism leviticus  jeremiah\\n the foretelling of mass genocide in exodus

view of gods immoralism can be changed thank you for the responses thus far i need some time to think as well as sleep as i have work in the morning i’ll share my thoughts and work through some

       " 'cmv the current discourse surrounding pedophilia and viewing it as synonymous with child molestation is counterproductive and cause for otherwise preventable sexual offences disclaimer  because apparently this hasnt been stressed enough i dont want to give pedophiles child pornography i dont want more pedophiles around children i dont want to make child molestation legal i dont want therapies that teach pedophiles that its okay to act on urges i want a cultural climate in which the existence of pedophilia as a sexual desire is recongnized and distinguished from the act of child molestation for the purpose of them feeling safe enough to voluntarily and without fear of repercusions seek treatment that focuses on supressing desires and avoiding riskful situations and behaviours before they become offenders again hope that clears things up  i’m not a pedophile but interested inadvocating for a more effective way to protect children i’ve been in a happy relationship with an adult woman for several years now and never have viewed a child as anything other than i child i only bring this up because there seem some people who will immediately jump to conclusions as i’ve experienced as it seems uncommon to use throwaways on here i will conform and use my regular profile trusting the reddit community to take my words at face value  i’m not arguing for something like discussed during the sexual revolution in the s where there were proposals to decriminalize or legalize sex with children it is thoroughly wrong in my opinion and i’m  for criminalizing child molestation and child abuse to anyone who experienced this i’m deeply sorry for what you had to go through and i wholeheartedly understand if you’re disgusted by my position is a sexual preference not consciously decided on or easily suppressed without treatment and professional help the understandable stigmatizing of pedophilia leads to fear of pedophiles outing themselves and seeking effective help simultaneously it prevents policy makers to supply funds for the research and implementation for effective therapies as it would seem weak on or sympathizing with pedophiles bring this up because of a post yesterday in which i’ve advocated for something similar – though not as explicit as here – and faced a lot of negative reactions my goal is in the best scenario to see if i’m missing some benefit of the tabooing and shaming of pedophilic tendencies and change my view accordingly or – at least – to find an underlying rational that would oppose my view on a different level than an emotional one talking about pedophilia and pedophiles in a medical sense here not following the common usage of the word as synonymous with child molester this means anyone who feels sexually attracted to prepubescent children i’m diverging from the common medical definition in the sense that i’m also including people attracted to adolescents during puberty because it applies similarly and is in my opinion something that should be prevented of outing themselves preventing treatment our current climate i think it’s far to stigmatized to out yourself as a pedophile even for the purpose of getting therapy most people will react understandably disgusted when someone tells them he has pedophilic tendencies this is problematic in the sense that a lot of pedophiles are deeply disgusted with their preferences themselves this article goes into a bit more detail about the whole situation detailing the depression and suicidal thoughts faced by many pedophiles furthermore it explains that a lot of pedophiles don’t want to commit the atrocity they are attracted to but given the climate a lot of them will be too frightened to talk to their loved ones gp or a specialist because of fear of getting judged regardless if they molested a child already or only have difficulties suppressing their urge to problem with that is that – i think – being continuously depicted as monstrous sexual offenders by society and internalizing that self view might actually decrease the threshold to become an offender if everyone including you already thinks you’re more monster than men why not just give in to it the other side we have programs like “don’t offend” spearheaded by the charité university hospital in berlin the program has been widely praised in the field and by participiants as evident by their review section the options range from everything starting with group therapy to chemical castration if sought after by the pedophile and will help the partaking individuals to find the best ways on how to get ahead of their preferences and not wanting to satisfy their urges sadly they have to invest a massive amount of resources in raising awareness and securing the anonymity of participants fear of being somehow outed or only picking up leaflets somewhere will still cause that a lot of people – who would benefit from the program and not be as likely to become an offender – will never go there despite the track record and i can blame them british man was so desperate he moved to germany to be able to access a dunkelfeld programme in an email exchange with the guardian the man who wished to remain anonymous wrote “so far all i have ever received from the nhs is doors slammed in my face “despite paedophilia being listed as a mental illness in the dsm the standard classification of mental disorders they don’t want to help you they just want to see you locked up or perhaps even burnt at the stake i am so sick and tired of uk medical ‘professionals’ looking at me as if i’ve grown horns and a barbed tail” guardian and policymakers cant support therapy programs actually brings me to my second point policy makers fearing to back programs like this out of fear of being labeled to sympathize with sex offenders there is an effective therapy that will lead to keeping children safe but as it focuses on preventing offenders from offending instead of the victims it faces an uphill battle like that are unlikely to get implemented because the regulations for keeping the identities of pedophiles in therapy isn’t possible in a lot of countries in many countries they couldn’t even be effectively be therapized because if they already became an offender and not want to offend again the couldn’t be open about what they’ve done which is necessary for therapy because the psychologist would legally be required to alert the police changes in these laws seem unlikely because of the optics it would’ve if a politican proposed something like that goes for the funding of these projects or research in that area gladly that program in berlin is backed by the german administration but as far as my experience goes most people voting for that administration don’t know that the cduspd supports this in their program and will be offended or downright angry because of it this is only possible because of a consensus to keep quite about this by politicians of all over the spectrum and the media however if i imagine something like this in the us i just cant picture a world where fox news wouldn’t call for the heads of the party writing something like this in their official agenda change my view typos  disclaimer  sorry for screaming',\n",

       " 'cmv as a trans person i believe that current trans activism has completely lost the plot they will lose much of the public debate they choose to engage in due to their overly radical agenda my argument is largely philosophical so its somewhat malleable and i legitimately would like yo see it changed i would prefer to believe in and support current trans activism wholeheartedly but far too often find myself shaking my head instead theres a few points on which i base my contention a trans woman i do not believe that i am biologically female and i dont believe that i should have to be to access womens spaces im female like and function well enough as one i look female i experience much of if not the majority of the same baggage as biological females im more physically like a female than a male and pose about as much danger to females as any other female due to the effects of hormones despite this i know that if nature had been left to its own devices i would have been completely capable of reproducing through the production of male sex gametes sperm furthermore i still have male reproductive organs theyve simply been switched off by the effects of long term hormone replacement therapy and potentially could function completely again on the cessation of hormones i think it is an inherently unwinnable fight to argue that i am biologically female based on nothing more than the potential and unproven configuration of my brain hardware have seen trans activism push an agenda that states that biological sex is an entirely socially constructed concept based on the existence of intersex people i think this makes about as much sense as saying that because orange exists red and yellow arent real colors biological sex is at its core about sex gametes in the absence of a reproductive system that functionally produces one its relatively easy to deduce which gamete a persons biology was intended to  produce  even in the presence of the overwhelming majority of intersex conditions and even at an extreme enough end that you can argue an intersex person is not neatly either male or female males and females still exist independent of them this hurts trans activism goals if trans activism spent less time trying to convince people that biological sex is made up and more time educating people about the effects hormones have on trans bodies i believe that we would be much further into achieving our social and political goals by now i believe that we are bogged down in an unwinnable and inherently disingenuous fight we are driving away people who believe in rationalism and science a la people who would actually be very receptive to treating transgenderism as a medical condition with a very specific and unorthodox  treatment regimen and instead of trying to sway them with an argument that appeals to their natures we are fighting them with unscientific rhetoric i have actually changed my view at this point regarding biological sex uconvoces raised to me a really good point that if you can point to an exception within your paradigm then the scientifically honest thing to do is rethink your paradigm if  of cases do not work within it then it was too broad ive come to believe that sex is nuanced and while someone might not necessarily fall within a strict female category that does not necessarily indicate that they are males rather biological sex is a mix of different characteristics which are not always able to be defined neatly and the social role a person lives in is as important if not more important than potentially invisible characteristics have seen trans activists push a genitals dont matter argument when it comes to sex and dating while i do not believe that a man dating a preop trans woman is gay genitals are very important to many people when it comes to sex trans activism states that this reduces people solely to their genitals but its frankly terrifyingly batshit to argue to people that the parts used in sex should not matter when it comes to sex it is not transphobic for someone to not want a particular configuration of genitals in their bedroom that is their prerogative this hurts trans activism i have seen lesbians show up in rrelationships and rasktransgender threads describing being shamed and ostracized by their friends for not wanting to sleep with trans women  i have seen gay men do the same regarding trans men the lgb community has typically had a strong association with the t community and they are all potential allies we are united in the ways we are stigmatized yet when we are the ones doing the stigmatizing we risk alienating them from our cause lastly i have seen trans activists argue that you do not need to be gender dysphoric to be transgender merely self identified as something other than your birth sex this fundamentally makes no sense and runs contrary to the entire pathology of what it means to be transgender its as fundamentally incorrect as arguing that gay men dont have to be sexually attracted to men to be gay you just have to self identify gender dysphoria is integral to shaping a transgender identity this particular argument seems purely ideological that people should be allowed to identify as whatever sex they feel like because gender is dead and anything goes i believe at minimum this actually reinforces sexist gender roles since believing that because you are effeminate or gender nonconforming as a man or the inverse as a woman actually makes you the other sex or a third sex undermines the progress feminism has made to insist that women can be masculine and still women or that men can be feminine still men  this hurts trans activism after countless conversations with cis opponents of protrans bathroom laws ive come to the conclusion that most cisgender people could care less what someone who has transitioned does and where they go the bathroom their primary fear comes from the wording typically being used the gender they identify as cis people are most afraid of there being no standards whatsoever imposed on access to sex segregated spaces when were arguing that there should be no bare minimum standards for being identified as the opposite sex we are playing directly into those fears when cis people are afraid that men will wake up and decide they are a woman why are we arguing thats not how it works then turning around and in different conversations arguing that its exactly how it works summation i believe that by embracing radical and untrue tenents based on ideological goals rather than objective reality trans activism is actually driving away potential supporters and otherwise reasonable people who could be potential allies thanks to uiyzie pointing out the scary possibility or republican lawmakers being charged by the evangelical right with determining who is and isnt transgender enough ive partially changed my view on nondysphoric trans people i havent necessarily changed my view that they are not actually transgender people only that it is dangerous to start drawing lines in the sand to determine who is and is not legitimate and that once you establish that power for a reasonable group it becomes easier for unreasonable groups to seize that power so what i have changed my view on is that trans activists pushing the view that anyone can be trans is not necessarily harmful because they are rightfully trying to avoid a legitimate slippery slope\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'cmv universal basic income is superior to a jobs guarantee   \\n  \\nive been paying a lot of attention to the us  elections and in particular some of the policies brought forward by the various candidates two policies in particular that i think are worth examining in more detail are bernie sanders federal jobs guarantee and andrew yangs ubi i think they are interesting in that they are two solutions to the same problem — runaway capitalism — but i ultimately think that of the two a universal basic income is the superior solution i have been a fan of ubi for a while now not sure when i first heard of it but i liked it since i did so i admit to some pro ubi bias and i disliked a job guarantee from the moment i heard of it so i admit an anti jg bias in the spirit of epistemic hygiene i would lay out why i oppose a jobs guarantee why i think a ubi is counterfactually better i would be light in my pro ubi section because of length and what could convince me to change my mind   \\n  \\nbefore we begin id like you to take not of the fact that i said counterfactually better i am not claiming that the status quo is better than a jobs guarantee but that a universal basic income program is better than a jobs guarantee to defend a jobs guarantee its not sufficient to make the case that warts and all its superior to the status quo you must make the case that its superior to a universal basic income the world youd be comparing a jobs guarantee to isnt the status quo but a world with universal basic income  \\n  \\nnbsp  \\n\\n  \\nnbsp  \\n  \\n i oppose a federal jobs guarantee  \\n  \\n note on incentives\\nbefore i lay the case for why i am opposed to a jobs guarantee i would like to talk about my beliefs regarding incentives as they are central to why i oppose job guarantees a defense of these beliefs would be worth its own post so i wouldnt lay out the motivation for these beliefs and would instead just lay out the beliefs themselves i do not take these beliefs as axiomatic so it is not fruitless to argue against them though i would prefer you didnt do that as the burden of evidence required for me to meaningfully change my mind on this is much higher but your efforts would be better served attacking the arguments against a job guarantee directly that said these are my beliefs     \\n  \\n most humans largely have the same preferences most of us have the same basic needs food shelter clothing and similar wants higher status happiness happiness for our loved ones etc theres variation in specifics eg different preferences in types of houses but we do prefer houses generally\\n most problems in complex systems involving humans can be explained using incentives systematic bad behaviour is often as a result of incentive structures which incentivise undesirable behaviour amongst members of the system its rarely as a result of personal moral failings of members of the system  \\n as a corollary to the above most successes in complex systems involving humans can be explained using incentives systematic good behaviour is often as a result of incentive structures which incentivise desirable behaviour amongst members of the system its rarely as a result of personal moral uprightness of members of the system  \\n from the above i conclude that the best way to improve complex human systems is to change the extant incentives rather than to change the people involved either by replacement or modifying their utility function directly if your plan requires people to be especially moral to be effective then its a shite plan the desired outcomes should occur even when the individuals involved have no moralpersonality idiosyncrasies as a result of the incentives in place  \\n  \\nnbsp  \\n  \\n case against a jobs guarantee  \\n  \\ni am not a gainst a jobs guarantee because of the jobs part but largely because of the guarantee part assuming that the guarantee implies that workers cant be fired excluding extraneous circumstances and theres strong job security a jobs guarantee perverts the incentive structures it decouples employee productivity from employee compensation and removes any incentive employees have to be productive at their workplace without an incentive to be productive employees would be counterfactually much less productive than they would be under private employment one could argue that employee productivity is already decoupled from employee compensation but i would counter that while there isnt a very strong positive correlation between productivity and compensation the two are largely still correlated for example higher productivity may lead to bonuses promotions raises stock options or rise in company valuation for employees who have stock options more benefits etc on the other hand lower productivity may lead to no bonuses less benefits lowered wages demotions getting fired the private sector generally tracks some measure of employee productivity and it seems to factor into decision making they are also incentivised to reward higher productivity and punish lower productivity so its what you would expect  \\n  \\nthe above leads to a situation in which the average employee in a jobs guarantee program is less productive than a similarly compensated employee in the private sector this makes the economy less efficient as a whole and as each jobs guarantee employee is one less private sector employee there is a reduction in overall productivity furthermore there are allocative inefficiencies as employees in jobs programs may not be matched to the most appropriate application of their skills granted this would also occur in the private sector but a jobs guarantee would exacerbate it further depressing economic output \\n  \\nfurthermore employing several tens of millions of people a number that would only rise as accelerating technological advancement displaces more and more private sector employees has massive bureaucracy a lot of resources would be expended merely administering all the workers this giant bureaucracy would likely incentivise systematic inefficiency and lead to even more resource waste  \\n  \\nto make matters worse workers admitted into a jobs guarantee program may find it exceedingly difficult to transition to the private sector federal employees already find transitioning to the private sector difficult but a jobs guarantee may make this worse due to skill atrophy as a result of the lowered productivity this creates a class of workers dependent on the government for sustenance this would make ending the jobs guarantee program difficult in the future as it would lead to significant hardship for tens of millions of people and entrenches the inefficiency ultimately this reduces the jobs guarantee program to workfare welfare with a work requirement like the victorian workhouses we are left with a ginormous bureaucracy that is woefully inefficient and wastes both the governments resources and workers  \\n  \\nto top it all off workers in a jobs guarantee program are out of luck if they dislike their assigned jobs however as theye dependent on it theyre unlikely to quit as the dependent population would only continue to grow as more and more people are displaced from the workforce all the above problems would become progressively worse  \\n  \\nnbsp  \\n  \\n case for a jobs guarantee  \\n  \\nthe main advantages of a jobs guarantee i see are  \\n  \\n cost it would be less expensive than a universal basic income program  \\n labour the government gains access to a steady and reliable labour force for various projects like infrastructure development climate change etc  \\n  \\nthe first is a point in a jobs guarantees favour though it would grow faster than a ubi as each displaced private sector worker is one more jobs guarantee worker as for the second a normal jobs program without the guarantee part seems superior all the advantages without many of the disadvantages as i said before i am not opposed to jobs programs ultimately it seems to me that the only advantage of a jobs guarantee over a universal basic income is cost and i think the benefits of ubi and the disadvantages of a jobs guarantee tip the scale in ubis favour  \\n  \\nnbsp  \\n\\n  \\nnbsp  \\n  \\n i support universal basic income  \\n  \\nthere are many reasons to support universal basic income on its own or as an alternative to a jobs guarantee and i dont really want to rehash here what you can read elsewhere so i just linked them above and below ill formulate the arguments most relevant to me  \\n  \\nthe ssc article goes into more detail about this if you read only one link above read that one but a ubi helps many classes of people that a jobs guarantee does not disabled caretakers parents\\n  \\nin my case against a jobs guarantee i mentioned that a jobs guarantee would likely lead to a reduction in economic output ubi does the exact opposite by putting money directly into the hands of everyone ubi acts as a massive financial stimulus to the economy most of the people who receive ubi would spend a lot of their extra income and that money would go to others who would also spend some of the money so the fiscal multiplier would be high the increased money in circulation would likely result in a significant increase in economic ouftput a study by the roosevelt institute on mo predicted a permanent  rise in gdp after  years  \\n  \\nfurthermore ubi is likely to increase productivity not only compared to a jobs guarantee world but also compared to the current one ubi gives workers financial independence no longer dependent on their employers government and private sector alike for sustenance they are are free to identify the jobs best suited to their particular skillsets milton friedman said no one spends anothers money as wisely as he spends his own as a corollary to that i would say no one spends anothers labour as wisely as they spend their own the financial independence provided by a ubi would drastically reduce the allocative efficiencies that would exist under a jobs guarantee program and under the current system this could result in a substantial increase in productivity this in particular is one of the things that most excites me about a ubi    \\n  \\nadministering a ubi has relatively very little bureaucracy involved and much lower administrative costs so there would be less wastage of resources labour capital etc in maintaining a ubi program admittedly the monetary cost due to inefficiency in a jobs guarantee program would be offset by the greater expenses in a ubi program but a ubi also does more and the administrative workers maintaining the bureaucracy would be free to do more productive work  \\n  \\nnbsp  \\n\\n  \\nnbsp  \\n  \\n to change my mind  \\n  \\ni admittedly havent done much research into jobs guarantees so i expect that there are things i am wrong on misunderstanding or whose impact im incorrectly estimating i think it would be easier to shift my mind on a jobs guarantee than on ubi not as much as for incentives but i am pretty firmly in the pro ubi camp and the burden of evidence required to change that is pretty high so ill focus on that in this section  \\n  \\nill be more favourable towards a jobs guarantee if  \\n  \\n the guarantee is softer than i believe and compensation isnt completely decoupled from productivity  \\n there are other incentive structures that i am not aware of in place to maintain productivity  \\n the us government is competent at administering tens of millions of workers and the bureaucracy involved in administering jobs guarantee workers grows sufficiently sublinearly with the number of workers the resource wastage is otherwise significantly smaller than i currently believe  \\n a jobs guarantee program has other benefits over a ubi besides being less expensive and providing the government with a reliable source of labour  \\n  \\nnbsp  \\n\\n  \\nnbsp  \\n  \\nthanks for participating ',\n",

they can bring a coffeemaker to work or carry a thermos and pour the coffee into it for better insulation who want to drink on the road have no other option but to wait with the lid on scared to take a sip its unconscionable  couple of counters to common replies serving temperature and brewing temperature are not the same  is a microroastery guide on optimal brewing temperature which by the way is not boiling which goes into more depth\\n\\n is a medical paper on the ideal coffee temperature to avoid burns publishe din the medical journal burns in \\n\\n to this article the ideal serving temperature which was determined using both data about risk of burns and the subjective taste and experience preference of  subjects was  degrees however the average serving temperature at restaurants is between  and  degrees ice is not a good solution i am working on a longer writeup for this point including calculations of heat transfer but lunch is being served ill try to work on it asap update  i am too lazy to do math but aside from still providing an inexact time over which the temperature changes my other issue here is theres no reason to think this will lower it to the proper amount without lowering the temperature too much it may still be too hot or too cold let me add more emphasis to a small part of this its not just that i want my coffee to be generally a bit cooler there are lots of solutions to that i want it to basically be as hot as possible without actually causing burns at a biological level if it is hot enough to make me pull back or say whoa thats hot its fine if its hot enough to kill the top layer of skin cells on my tongue its not outside of people who actually like being burned the only reason to serve it above the temperature that causes burn seems to be if you want to carry it and drink it later which i addressed in the first part of the question  concept ive had to go into a few times is drinkable window we all have a range of temperatures where we find coffee drinkable theres some subjectiveness here of course but i argue that most people dont actually drink coffee when it would burn them they wait until it cools sipping off the top until it gets there if we take the temperature at which they actually start taking full sips instead of tentative slurps and measure how long it takes for that temperature to reach the too cold area that time remains the same regardless of how hot the coffee initially was it doesnt have a memory of how how it was a few minutes ago  the total drinkable window of the coffee is unchanged by the starting temperature only by your personal preference of how wide that range is the only reason to serve it hotter than the high end of that preference is if youre planning to store it for a bit before drinking which i think is a small number of cases i think it is more reasonable and safer for them to put the hot coffee into an insulated container while parked than for me to try and sip scalding coffee while i drive to test whether it is safe to drink and if i just let it sit for an extended safe period of time i have missed out on a lot of that drinkable window ive invested a lot of time into this as it is a slow day at work i still should not have as i have a long list of things to do from this point on i will probably only respond to things that are original or that are easy to reply to thanks for a fun conversation everyone i hope others who agree with me will carry on the debate with more vigour as i step back a bit i think a redditor has just changed my life  find you and guild you soon but im trying to finish my inbox and ive neglected a bit of work i have to do before  sorry man bother me if i dont get to it tonight oops i still ahvent guilded him according to a

       " 'cmv there are no extra ethical obligations for white parents who adopt children of color this may be a bit of a niche issue i was recently told that it was justifiable for parents seeking to adopt children to prefer children of their own race because there is an increased burden specifically in the context of white parents adopting black children to provide a child of color with role models and peers of that color the justification for this view was in part that only people of color could effectively speak to a child of color about experiencing racism and secondly that culturally the child of color should be exposed to but not forced into their associated culture strikes me as backwards for several reasons \\nthis view promotes systemic racism in adoption white parents are statistically in better positions to adopt children than black parents are but under this view black children are potentially denied opportunities to be adopted because the view promotes arbitrary and illusory difficulties associated with raising them to me the overwhelming benefits of having a stable family would outweigh any of the problems that might result from white parents adopting a black child but i do not think these are real problems to begin with  it seems problematic to me to suggest that just because a child has a certain skin color and ancestry they should be exposed to the culture associated with that skin color and ancestry this isnt to say that african american culture or any other culture in america is invalid only that its okay if a black kid grows up without getting exposure to american african american culture from their parents and even if this is a legitimate concern the internet basically ensures that every child today can have exposure to any culture that interests them  only problem that i think comes the closest to being legitimate is that it may be difficult for a white parent to speak with authority on issues of experiencing racism but i have two solutions for white parents they can research the issue and relay advice from people of color on the issue to their child good advice is good advice even if it is relayed through a pair of white people or they can focus on teaching their child how to learn for themselves which is something they should do anyways then the child can learn from voices of color on their own or in tandem with the parent neither method i think requires anything the parent shouldnt already be doing for their child  person who espoused these views is someone i have immense respect for but we just could not come to an agreement one way or the other in the short time of our discussion so im interested in seeing what the people of this wonderful subreddit have to say and changing my view if it makes sense',\n",
       " 'cmv the superhero genre is really just centered around spectacle and the creative exploration of superpowers but there is no real depth to it in general warning there is a spoiler for the marvel film civil war ahead writer brandon sanderson once said what your magic cant do is more interesting than what it can do i heard this phrase it really made me appreciate how true that is soon after i watched the marvel movie civil war and realized that basically all superheroes are mary sues and they all have equal power levels while watching it i got the sense that they were all just made of invincibilium and the fighting didnt mean anything nobody was going to be permanently injured much less killed when they are killed its always built up and has an obvious subversion of the rules of the universe up until that point when don cheadles character was crippled by falling from the sky i almost laughed out loud here we have a movie full of highpowered superheroes fighting each other and yet the only significant injury is from a guy falling and hitting the ground its pretty absurd really why i think this shows that the films arent meant for a postjuvenile audience is that when youre a kid all you care about is how awesome the superheroes are you dont want them to have weaknesses but once you reach a certain age things change in movie reviews for other genres youll often read the critic espousing what a wellrounded and human character soandso is and that almost always involves their flaws as well as their strengths because we understand that this is what an interesting character is heroes journey almost always involves a person who is mediocre weak or somehow not as good as they could be the story is about them growing improving maturing whatever  and eventually coming out a better stronger person on the other side superheroes dont really follow this arc often they start off normal or whatever but then they just skip straight to becoming powerful and never stop noticed this in the arrowverse tv shows also very often a plot will revolve around a superhero either killing or not killing and the internal struggle of this i think this is often a point in the story because once you have a mary sue superhero who is unkillable the drama can only come by them choosing to utilize their power to its full extent or not to me this is very boring its kind of like taking something immature and trying to contrive it into something more mature like vincent adultman on bojack horseman okay that was a bit of a stretch heard people say try to defend the superhero genre but i feel like this is kind of indefensible i mean dont get me wrong i think superhero movies speak to a very real part of us all the part that thinks people with superpowers are fucking awesome which they are but thats only because you dont care about the things that end up being more important in fiction we just love the spectacle of it i think the only really potentially interesting characters in the superhero genre are villains they are vulnerable obviously  theyre always defeated by the superheroes  and the potential is always there for a compelling and humanistic backstory  the batman series does this well probably some others too however i think there arent enough interesting villains like this to vindicate the genre as a whole as often its acceptable to just have the villains be fairly onedimensional this has gotten a lot of attention so i guess ill address a couple quick things acknowledge that characters can change over time despite being invulnerable dark knight and watchmen are two good examples of superhero movies that subvert many tropes of the genre true im a fan of both in batman in particular though i think the villains are equally as interesting as the hero if not more so and watchmen is a unique spin on the superhero genre almost more like an indictment of it than a part of it moment i remember from when i was younger that opened my eyes about superheroes is this speech from the film angus superman is not brave  superman is invulnerable\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'i believe that we should have a reverse boot camp when veterans return from active duty in order to better transition them back into society cmv so from my limited understanding of this ive read that ptsd and depression just two examples are reaching ridiculous levels of diagnosis it would seem that coming back from the events of war causes significant changes in ones mental state and that transitioning back to society is extremely difficult even for the soldiers who are fine we know a lot of ways to combat ptsd and depression and theres new studies coming out all the time so its clearly something we as a society care about just seems to me that generally american society continually spouts the whole i support the troops mindset but what does that really mean the biggest problems that face troops dont have to do with supplies funding or a lack of training going into the conflict but their transition back into society afterwards we train them to go into the conflict why would we not train them to come out of it we know that many many troops struggle with this and we know how to treat it obviously each case is different but i mean as an overarching topic we do know treatment methods it seems like a no brainer that we should be doing something about it in my mind the best way to do this would be to have some sort of mandatory program for soldiers when they return it could be just a month or two long after which those soldiers who still need help will at least have the resources readily available to them and it would consist of living and working as a group to achieve peaceful goals possibly raising animals spending a lot of time outside etc etc even for those soldiers who arent suffering from these serious issues would benefit from some down time to reduce stress levels and transition back into everyday life ugroovyoctopus suggested possibly doing volunteer work i thought it was worth mentioning up here as well so new readers could see it money for all of this in the perfect world would come from all the excess military spending that this country pumps out if you dont believe that just google excess military spending and see what comes up final supporting point is that over half of all enlisted forces are between the ages of  this means that most people who are enlisted are still relatively young and have not spent a lot of time off in the real world on their own so another argument is that since they have not spent a lot of time interacting with society as a regular citizen then they have very little to fall back on in terms of old habits or old feelings to relate to thats the thinking behind my view im really interested in reading some arguments as to why we dont already do this everyone i understand that funding might be the biggest issue people are going to raise i would prefer to hear other arguments against this because funding is the most apparenteasiest one to spot but also the easiest one to refute this whole topic was sparked in my mind over this recent this american life story skip to deep dark open secret ive already clarified in comments below so instead of posting the same thing to each reply the program would definitely provide ample time to spend with family and friends i think that the program could be structured in such a way that veterans could commute to the camp in order to preform tasks much like a  job it would not necessitate being away from their families for another month or two after the end of deployment  also the details of the program arent what matters so much about my post if you have suggestions about what soldiers could be doing during this reverse boot camp time id gladly hear them however my view isnt so much about what they should be doing to reintegrate but the fact that they should be doing something and that something should be organized and paid for by the military that put them in a combat zone  for anyone who wants to say that we already have programs in place like individual counseling etc i am aware of that and that is a valid point however before you post it id like you to take a look at veteran suicide rates or just google it if you dont like that article theyre out of control so it would appear that the system we have in place isnt working if you have evidence to refute that id love to read up on it  it has been brought to my attention that reintegration programs do exist in each branch of the military i guess someone thought this was a good idea before however from the descriptions ive read they sound terribly ineffective extremely dry boring no one takes them seriously etc i guess the cmv has transitioned from there should be these programs to these programs need to change thanks to everyone for their input so far ill do my best to keep replying below but at this point i guess changing my original view is impossible because these programs already exist however if people wish to keep the discussion going from where it has evolved to i believe these programs are ineffective and need to change feel free to put your input below',\n",

       " 'cmv cupcakes are vastly overrated while the cupcake craze of the early s has lessened there are still a number of residual holdouts peddling their gourmet cupcakes for  here in chicago there are mollys sprinkles magnolia bakery the cupcake counter and countless other selfindulgent cupcake hellholes they are a symbol of the vast marketing done by big cupcake to make us believe that cupcakes are a superior dessert they sit among the cookie the cake and the pie in great american desserts however such a statement is a lie and cupcakes while tasty are overrated due to  inefficient taste delivery  irregular proportions  messiness and  overrated convenience these  points are not exclusive but cover the basic reasons why cupcakes do not deserve the laud and attention they currently entertain\\n position a cupcake is a cake based dessert that consist of cake batter placed in ridged paper cups baked in a specific pan with holes the cake batter bakes until it overflows the hole and is then frosteddecorated on top before being served image for reference furthermore the purpose of a cupcake is to be a more efficient delivery system of cake that can also be individualized\\n inefficient taste delivery in appearance a cupcake make sense as a individualized cake however the delivery of frosting and cake is inefficient as the structure of a cupcake makes it impossible to taste the cake and frosting evenly the generally accepted method of biting a cupcake is to pinch the sides of the stump open ones mouth and then bite down through the frosting and up through the cake this supposedly avoids the messiness of grabbing the frosting while still allowing a person to eat the cupcake with hisher hands some may bite the frosting or cake first but those people are fucked in the head however the inherent design of a cupcake makes it impossible to deliver an even taste instead the biter distinctly tastes frosting on the roof of his mouth and cake on his tounge in contrast other handheld foods like a sandwich or burger addresses this issue by encasing the center filling meat cheese condiments etc with bread allowing every bite to be even in how the varying tastes are delivered some have suggested that you can rip the stump off to put it on top of the cupcake but this only proves my point that the natural design of a cupcake is flawed and therefore it is overrated as a dessert\\n irregular proportions the inherent design flaw of cupcakes leads to my next point the irregular proportions and delivery cupcakes especially gourmet ones have gotten excessive in their proportions of frosting to cake while cakes normally adhere to a range of frosting depth current cupcakes can range from  to  of frosting on top this picture alone shows how ridiculous it can get it is not standardized in any way can leave you with either too much sweet frosting or too little depending on the one you get added to the already  stump youre also looking at possibly an  bite unless you can unhinge your jaw such a is ridiculous as a result you will always receive irregular proportions of frosting and cake as you try to tilt the cupcake for a bite such proportions show that the cupcake is overrated as a dessert \\n messiness the fucked up proportions of current cupcakes causes the next point messiness cupcakes appear to be a cleaner alternative to your average cake its handheld contained in a paper wrapping and solid enough to be turned upside now and not collapse or fall apart however to anyone who has eaten a cupcake they understand that the paper wrapping becomes more of a hindrance than a help once pulled down the wrapping either blocks the bite rubs the bottom of the chin with its dirtiness or gets completely removed for better cupcake eating but once removed the wrapper is now useless waste much like a plate except that unlike a plate the wrapper can no longer catch the crumbs from each bite instead they fall to the floor or your hand additionally the frosted top often too big to consume in one bite will brush the upper lip or nose leaving frosting residue as a result you are left with cake crumbs on your hands and frosting on your face thus messiness\\n overrated convenience the messiness of the cupcake supports the final point the overrated convenience of a cupcake a cupcake is intended to be a more convenient cake yet it leaves you with the same messiness and garbage a slice of cake would coupled with the inefficient delivery of fucked up proportions the convenience of eating a cupcake is made minute if not nonexistent additionally if making your own the individualized nature of each cupcake destroys the convenience of the cupcake both baking frosting and cleaning are exponentially increased in time and effort so as to render any future convenience worthless\\n it stands the cupcake should be relegated to novelty desserts that while tasty are inherently flawed by their design\\n\\n i ask you to change my view on the inferiority of the cupcake and its overrated position in the dessert pantheon\\n thanks so much for the comments its making a slow day go by quick im still of the opinion that cupcakes are vastly overrated despite their inherent design flaws and underwhelming eating experience but i need to get some work done so ill be taking a break from responding please continue
