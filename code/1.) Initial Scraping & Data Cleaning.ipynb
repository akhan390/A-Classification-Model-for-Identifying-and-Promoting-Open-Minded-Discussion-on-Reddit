Even with this loss, he is still worth over $55 billion dollars.\\n\\n\\nI believe that this effortless spending on Bloombergs part showcases the reality that is wealth inequality between the ultra rich and working class. While I do not believe the rich should give up their fortunes, I do believe that any arguments against taxing them more is simply propaganda from those who hold the wealth and higher power at this point. \\n\\nCertain media outlets claim that taxing the super wealthy is unfair and would be detrimental to those below them due to \"trickle down\" effects. There is also rhetoric that many self made billionaires worked hard for their fortunes, and that if we as Americans work hard, we might be rich ourselves one day.\\n\\nI believe that moving forward, we should push for much higher taxes on those earning/worth more than 1 billion USD. If the money Bloomberg spent on his campaign went to actual communities that need funding, actual change could have been possible. Social programs could benefit greatly from these funds, and maybe we could afford to better fund national programs such as healthcare or family leave.</td>\n",

Third, he has been an avid defender of Trump and the MAGA agenda. Just from reviewing other threads on reddit, there are people willing to vote for him.

I must be missing it, because any time I try to research into a topic I get lost in opinion and bias. \\n\\nI am completely willing to hear and review and accept any examples of success or lasting positive change that has come about as a direct result of Trumps presidency. In fact I want to! It can’t be ALL bad.\\n\\nEdit1: a lot of responses here. I need to actually read the sources for the claims everyone’s making, so it may take a while for me to respond to each comment, but I will try. I’ll take this chance to remind everyone it’s possible to have civil discourse about even the most divisive topics, even the infamous DJT. Thanks all for the responses.\\n\\nEdit2: double thanks to those who are responding and engaging one another civilly, and awarding the post. I think it’s important to realize how biased we can become despite the facts. The good things don’t necessarily outweigh the bad, so maybe there’s a counter-post to be made regarding all of the harm DJT has done as well. Every point has a counter point, so take anything you hear with the ole’ grain of salt. I urge everyone to educate themselves and vote in the upcoming election for the candidate they believe in - and don’t let politics negatively impact your happiness. It’s just like any other thing, and can be harmful in high doses.\\n\\nEdit3: definitely had my view changed. I wanted examples of positives and I received examples with sources. I appreciate everyone’s responses, and feel better about having informed conversation about DJT’s presidency. Still have a lot to read and respond to!</td>\n",

Therefore, I am hereby announcing my bid to run as VP with Kim Kardashian. \\n\\nI still believe standardized cognitive testing should be administered. This could be automated, perhaps using open-source N-Back software or various standardized cognitive testing designed to screen for early cognitive decline. \\n\\nRegardless of who you like, this is a democracy, so register to vote and get those ballots in by November! \\n\\n---- Original Post ----\\n\\nThe office of the President of the United States is being used as a tool to boost social media presence, to syphon votes, and to simply sell products. This is an abuse of the office of the presidency and should be illegal, especially if someone has zero intent on running or winning. \\n\\nTo limit entry into this field, and to limit the abuse of power that has been recently demonstrated by Kanye West, it should be illegal to announce you are running for president unless you undergo a comprehensive set of exams that show you have at least a basic mental competency to run the United States of America. \\n\\nThe results of these exams should be available to everyone as a pass/fail, though the exact scores should be held secret so as not to be used to favor one candidate with a higher score over another. They should cover cognitive, physical, as well as brain scans using MRI, EEG, etc.\\n\\nWhile these tests may not completely stop such abuse, they would make it far more difficult for any celebrity to simply announce to their millions of Twitter followers that they are running for president. More importantly, voters could be assured that any candidate running for president has passed a basic competency exam, which would prevent candidates from using perceived cognitive decline as a political weapon.</td>\n",

       "0  Mike Bloomberg recently dropped out of the 2020 Presidential race after spending over $500 million dollars of his own money on his campaign. Even with this loss, he is still worth over $55 billion dollars.\\n\\n\\nI believe that this effortless spending on Bloombergs part showcases the reality that is wealth inequality between the ultra rich and working class. While I do not believe the rich should give up their fortunes, I do believe that any arguments against taxing them more is simply propaganda from those who hold the wealth and higher power at this point. \\n\\nCertain media outlets claim that taxing the super wealthy is unfair and would be detrimental to those below them due to \"trickle down\" effects. There is also rhetoric that many self made billionaires worked hard for their fortunes, and that if we as Americans work hard, we might be rich ourselves one day.\\n\\nI believe that moving forward, we should push for much higher taxes on those earning/worth more than 1 billion USD. If the money Bloomberg spent on his campaign went to actual communities that need funding, actual change could have been possible. Social programs could benefit greatly from these funds, and maybe we could afford to better fund national programs such as healthcare or family leave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "1  Kanye West is a shill for president Trump and running to syphon off young voters from voting for Biden. First, he may have an excentric take on reality but can't honestly believe that he has a chance of winning. Second, if he truly wanted to be president, he would have started his campaign last year when he still had a chance to get on state ballots. Third, he has been an avid defender of Trump and the MAGA agenda. Just from reviewing other threads on reddit, there are people willing to vote for him. Generally speaking, the fan base of artists like Kanye skews young and culturally diverse, which are both not likely to vote for Trump. \\n\\nThere are plenty of other reasons you can say that Kanye is running, but unless you say how my view is flawed I will only consider those reasons as supplemental to the above concept and not as a replacement for.\\n\\nEDIT: Interesting.... https://www.thedailybeast.com/billionaire-kanye-wests-company-yeezy-llc-gets-multimillion-dollar-ppp-loan-from-trump-admin?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=webfeeds                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "2  I write this because I am tired of the wild goose chase that is finding examples of his success. Anything surrounding Donald Trump is shrouded in divisive language and biased opinions. Liberals will have you believe he has done nothing, while conservatives will tout his unlimited success. I must be missing it, because any time I try to research into a topic I get lost in opinion and bias. \\n\\nI am completely willing to hear and review and accept any examples of success or lasting positive change that has come about as a direct result of Trumps presidency. In fact I want to! It can’t be ALL bad.\\n\\nEdit1: a lot of responses here. I need to actually read the sources for the claims everyone’s making, so it may take a while for me to respond to each comment, but I will try. I’ll take this chance to remind everyone it’s possible to have civil discourse about even the most divisive topics, even the infamous DJT. Thanks all for the responses.\\n\\nEdit2: double thanks to those who are responding and engaging one another civilly, and awarding the post. I think it’s important to realize how biased we can become despite the facts. The good things don’t necessarily outweigh the bad, so maybe there’s a counter-post to be made regarding all of the harm DJT has done as well. Every point has a counter point, so take anything you hear with the ole’ grain of salt. I urge everyone to educate themselves and vote in the upcoming election for the candidate they believe in - and don’t let politics negatively impact your happiness. It’s just like any other thing, and can be harmful in high doses.\\n\\nEdit3: definitely had my view changed. I wanted examples of positives and I received examples with sources. I appreciate everyone’s responses, and feel better about having informed conversation about DJT’s presidency. Still have a lot to read and respond to!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "3  In recent days some have decried the POTUS and FDOTUS brazenly ignoring federal ethics laws by posing with a certain company's bean products. \\n\\nBut I welcome it. The ethics rules really just obscure behind a thin veneer the truth of American politics: namely, many politicians are just in it for their friends and donors. \\n\\nWe shouldn't hide it anymore.

       "4  Edit: Ok, this has been fun and some great conversation, but I am beginning to feel like a one-man army trying to defend the gates of Sparta. \\n\\nI have changed my mind for three reasons. \\n\\n1) Test-taking ability is not necessarily an indication of one's ability to run the office of the president. \\n\\n2) He who creates the questions dictates the barrier for entry. \\n\\n3) Freedom of speech is a slippery slope, and even though announcing one's intent to run for president can and will continue to be abused, you can't knock out one brick and expect the wall to remain intact. Therefore, I am hereby announcing my bid to run as VP with Kim Kardashian. \\n\\nI still believe standardized cognitive testing should be administered. This could be automated, perhaps using open-source N-Back software or various standardized cognitive testing designed to screen for early cognitive decline. \\n\\nRegardless of who you like, this is a democracy, so register to vote and get those ballots in by November! \\n\\n---- Original Post ----\\n\\nThe office of the President of the United States is being used as a tool to boost social media presence, to syphon votes, and to simply sell products. This is an abuse of the office of the presidency and should be illegal, especially if someone has zero intent on running or winning. \\n\\nTo limit entry into this field, and to limit the abuse of power that has been recently demonstrated by Kanye West, it should be illegal to announce you are running for president unless you undergo a comprehensive set of exams that show you have at least a basic mental competency to run the United States of America. \\n\\nThe results of these exams should be available to everyone as a pass/fail, though the exact scores should be held secret so as not to be used to favor one candidate with a higher score over another. They should cover cognitive, physical, as well as brain scans using MRI, EEG, etc.\\n\\nWhile these tests may not completely stop such abuse, they would make it far more difficult for any celebrity to simply announce to their millions of Twitter followers that they are running for president. More importantly, voters could be assured that any candidate running for president has passed a basic competency exam, which would prevent candidates from using perceived cognitive decline as a political weapon.

I would assume it's the same group of people making crappy merchandise and cycling their names over and over again and buying the same fake reviews.\\n\\nBeyond this, I'm always worried that they've put some pollutant or carcinogen into the manufacturing process because their regulations are so lax. The examples in the media are countless--toothpaste with  diethylene glycol, pet food that kills our dogs and cats, toys with lead paint, make up with lead, beryllium, bacterial contamination, cheap hardware that self destructs after a year.\\n\\nAnd it can be so hard to tell because they often manufacture for companies like Mattel and Nestle so you think you're getting American or European.\\n\\nThis has been going on for decades and we just turn a blind eye to it because they're cheaper. Business ethics wise, they're about where the US was in the 1920s. This is an example of how capitalism can result in deadly consequences without strong governmental regulation.\\n\\nPlease feel free to downvote me into oblivion, whatever, I don't care, I'm just sick of the nonsense.\\n\\nEDIT: Thank you for the discussion. In response to comments:\\n\\n\\- Of the top 100,000 sellers on Amazon, 58% are from China, 36% from the United States. This does not take into account manufacturing.  \\n\\- Amazon shut down its China marketplace last year because consumers weren't willing to stray from JD and Taobao (Alibaba)  \\n\\- Authoritarian Capitalism: An economic system in which a capitalistic market economy exists alongside an authoritarian government.

       "0  It is disgusting. If Will had cheated on Jada the entire internet would turn on him and crucify him. Except because he is a man he is the one being mocked and memed.\\n\\nFirstly, we don't have a reason to be involved in their relationship, and if they choose to make it work then good on them. \\n\\nHowever, that doesn't mean Jada should be proud of her actions. She abused the trust of a great man. I'm kinda surprised the internet isn't backing Will on this to be honest.\\n\\nFYI the mods have banned me from posting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "1  It is so frustrating to shop on Amazon with the Chinese sellers and manufacturers on the site.\\n\\nThe fake reviews are overwhelming (think 50-90% fake reviews on FakeSpot or ReviewMeta), plus the products are cheap and break and when you go back to the manufacturer, most of them don't exist after 1-2 years. I would assume it's the same group of people making crappy merchandise and cycling their names over and over again and buying the same fake reviews.\\n\\nBeyond this, I'm always worried that they've put some pollutant or carcinogen into the manufacturing process because their regulations are so lax. The examples in the media are countless--toothpaste with  diethylene glycol, pet food that kills our dogs and cats, toys with lead paint, make up with lead, beryllium, bacterial contamination, cheap hardware that self destructs after a year.\\n\\nAnd it can be so hard to tell because they often manufacture for companies like Mattel and Nestle so you think you're getting American or European.\\n\\nThis has been going on for decades and we just turn a blind eye to it because they're cheaper. Business ethics wise, they're about where the US was in the 1920s. This is an example of how capitalism can result in deadly consequences without strong governmental regulation.\\n\\nPlease feel free to downvote me into oblivion, whatever, I don't care, I'm just sick of the nonsense.\\n\\nEDIT: Thank you for the discussion. In response to comments:\\n\\n\\- Of the top 100,000 sellers on Amazon, 58% are from China, 36% from the United States. This does not take into account manufacturing.  \\n\\- Amazon shut down its China marketplace last year because consumers weren't willing to stray from JD and Taobao (Alibaba)  \\n\\- Authoritarian Capitalism: An economic system in which a capitalistic market economy exists alongside an authoritarian government. China hasn't been a communist state in any real sense since the early 20th century, if ever.   \n",
       "2  I don’t understand why it’s illegal in some places and under many circumstances to sleep in your car. Your car is your property and you should have the right to sleep in it without question. For any reason whatsoever. It could be that you can’t afford an apartment or you just decided not to drive home drunk and sleep in your car. Or any other damn reason. I understand if you park your car on someone’s property illegally and try to sleep in it you should be forced to find another spot but sleeping in your car should be legal. It’s property and no one should be telling me that I can’t sleep in it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

After starting my own business and spending years in upper management I have to say I love millennials and think they will change the work place for the better.

       "4  I am a true believer that cereal with water is better. The taste of milk conflicts with the taste of the cereal, whereas water does not. While still getting the same texture, water does not ruin the taste of cereal. My friends crucified me when I told them this...so for this reason I am coming here in search of others who share my beliefs of water being better than milk. \\n\\nEdit: I pour the cereal before the water, for those asking\\n\\nEdit2: The much requested video:\\n[Cereal with water ](https://imgur.com/a/wiaNWqA)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

Even with this loss, he is still worth over $55 billion dollars.\\n\\n\\nI believe that this effortless spending on Bloombergs part showcases the reality that is wealth inequality between the ultra rich and working class. While I do not believe the rich should give up their fortunes, I do believe that any arguments against taxing them more is simply propaganda from those who hold the wealth and higher power at this point. \\n\\nCertain media outlets claim that taxing the super wealthy is unfair and would be detrimental to those below them due to \"trickle down\" effects. There is also rhetoric that many self made billionaires worked hard for their fortunes, and that if we as Americans work hard, we might be rich ourselves one day.\\n\\nI believe that moving forward, we should push for much higher taxes on those earning/worth more than 1 billion USD. If the money Bloomberg spent on his campaign went to actual communities that need funding, actual change could have been possible. Social programs could benefit greatly from these funds, and maybe we could afford to better fund national programs such as healthcare or family leave.</td>\n",

First, he may have an excentric take on reality but can't honestly believe that he has a chance of winning. Second, if he truly wanted to be president, he would have started his campaign last year when he still had a chance to get on state ballots. Third, he has been an avid defender of Trump and the MAGA agenda. Just from reviewing other threads on reddit, there are people willing to vote for him. Generally speaking, the fan base of artists like Kanye skews young and culturally diverse, which are both not likely to vote for Trump. \\n\\nThere are plenty of other reasons you can say that Kanye is running, but unless you say how my view is flawed I will only consider those reasons as supplemental to the above concept and not as a replacement for.\\n\\nEDIT: Interesting.... https://www.thedailybeast.com/billionaire-kanye-wests-company-yeezy-llc-gets-multimillion-dollar-ppp-loan-from-trump-admin?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=webfeeds</td>\n",

In fact I want to! It can’t be ALL bad.\\n\\nEdit1: a lot of responses here. I need to actually read the sources for the claims everyone’s making, so it may take a while for me to respond to each comment, but I will try. I’ll take this chance to remind everyone it’s possible to have civil discourse about even the most divisive topics, even the infamous DJT. Thanks all for the responses.\\n\\nEdit2: double thanks to those who are responding and engaging one another civilly, and awarding the post. I think it’s important to realize how biased we can become despite the facts. The good things don’t necessarily outweigh the bad, so maybe there’s a counter-post to be made regarding all of the harm DJT has done as well. Every point has a counter point, so take anything you hear with the ole’ grain of salt. I urge everyone to educate themselves and vote in the upcoming election for the candidate they believe in - and don’t let politics negatively impact your happiness. It’s just like any other thing, and can be harmful in high doses.\\n\\nEdit3: definitely had my view changed. I wanted examples of positives and I received examples with sources. I appreciate everyone’s responses, and feel better about having informed conversation about DJT’s presidency. Still have a lot to read and respond to!</td>\n",

Therefore, I am hereby announcing my bid to run as VP with Kim Kardashian. \\n\\nI still believe standardized cognitive testing should be administered. This could be automated, perhaps using open-source N-Back software or various standardized cognitive testing designed to screen for early cognitive decline. \\n\\nRegardless of who you like, this is a democracy, so register to vote and get those ballots in by November! \\n\\n---- Original Post ----\\n\\nThe office of the President of the United States is being used as a tool to boost social media presence, to syphon votes, and to simply sell products. This is an abuse of the office of the presidency and should be illegal, especially if someone has zero intent on running or winning. \\n\\nTo limit entry into this field, and to limit the abuse of power that has been recently demonstrated by Kanye West, it should be illegal to announce you are running for president unless you undergo a comprehensive set of exams that show you have at least a basic mental competency to run the United States of America. \\n\\nThe results of these exams should be available to everyone as a pass/fail, though the exact scores should be held secret so as not to be used to favor one candidate with a higher score over another. They should cover cognitive, physical, as well as brain scans using MRI, EEG, etc.\\n\\nWhile these tests may not completely stop such abuse, they would make it far more difficult for any celebrity to simply announce to their millions of Twitter followers that they are running for president. More importantly, voters could be assured that any candidate running for president has passed a basic competency exam, which would prevent candidates from using perceived cognitive decline as a political weapon.</td>\n",

       "0  Mike Bloomberg recently dropped out of the 2020 Presidential race after spending over $500 million dollars of his own money on his campaign. Even with this loss, he is still worth over $55 billion dollars.\\n\\n\\nI believe that this effortless spending on Bloombergs part showcases the reality that is wealth inequality between the ultra rich and working class. While I do not believe the rich should give up their fortunes, I do believe that any arguments against taxing them more is simply propaganda from those who hold the wealth and higher power at this point. \\n\\nCertain media outlets claim that taxing the super wealthy is unfair and would be detrimental to those below them due to \"trickle down\" effects. There is also rhetoric that many self made billionaires worked hard for their fortunes, and that if we as Americans work hard, we might be rich ourselves one day.\\n\\nI believe that moving forward, we should push for much higher taxes on those earning/worth more than 1 billion USD. If the money Bloomberg spent on his campaign went to actual communities that need funding, actual change could have been possible. Social programs could benefit greatly from these funds, and maybe we could afford to better fund national programs such as healthcare or family leave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "1  Kanye West is a shill for president Trump and running to syphon off young voters from voting for Biden. First, he may have an excentric take on reality but can't honestly believe that he has a chance of winning. Second, if he truly wanted to be president, he would have started his campaign last year when he still had a chance to get on state ballots. Third, he has been an avid defender of Trump and the MAGA agenda. Just from reviewing other threads on reddit, there are people willing to vote for him. Generally speaking, the fan base of artists like Kanye skews young and culturally diverse, which are both not likely to vote for Trump. \\n\\nThere are plenty of other reasons you can say that Kanye is running, but unless you say how my view is flawed I will only consider those reasons as supplemental to the above concept and not as a replacement for.\\n\\nEDIT: Interesting.... https://www.thedailybeast.com/billionaire-kanye-wests-company-yeezy-llc-gets-multimillion-dollar-ppp-loan-from-trump-admin?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=webfeeds                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "2  I write this because I am tired of the wild goose chase that is finding examples of his success. Anything surrounding Donald Trump is shrouded in divisive language and biased opinions. Liberals will have you believe he has done nothing, while conservatives will tout his unlimited success. I must be missing it, because any time I try to research into a topic I get lost in opinion and bias. \\n\\nI am completely willing to hear and review and accept any examples of success or lasting positive change that has come about as a direct result of Trumps presidency. In fact I want to! It can’t be ALL bad.\\n\\nEdit1: a lot of responses here. I need to actually read the sources for the claims everyone’s making, so it may take a while for me to respond to each comment, but I will try. I’ll take this chance to remind everyone it’s possible to have civil discourse about even the most divisive topics, even the infamous DJT. Thanks all for the responses.\\n\\nEdit2: double thanks to those who are responding and engaging one another civilly, and awarding the post. I think it’s important to realize how biased we can become despite the facts. The good things don’t necessarily outweigh the bad, so maybe there’s a counter-post to be made regarding all of the harm DJT has done as well. Every point has a counter point, so take anything you hear with the ole’ grain of salt. I urge everyone to educate themselves and vote in the upcoming election for the candidate they believe in - and don’t let politics negatively impact your happiness. It’s just like any other thing, and can be harmful in high doses.\\n\\nEdit3: definitely had my view changed. I wanted examples of positives and I received examples with sources. I appreciate everyone’s responses, and feel better about having informed conversation about DJT’s presidency. Still have a lot to read and respond to!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "3  In recent days some have decried the POTUS and FDOTUS brazenly ignoring federal ethics laws by posing with a certain company's bean products. \\n\\nBut I welcome it. The ethics rules really just obscure behind a thin veneer the truth of American politics: namely, many politicians are just in it for their friends and donors. \\n\\nWe shouldn't hide it anymore. Make these allegiances visible, front-and-center. \\n\\nWe should make it mandatory for politicians appearing in public to wear NASCAR-style jumpsuits with their major sponsors emblazoned across their bodies. Then we'll more readily know who they're beholden to and which companies we may want to boycott or patronize. \\n\\nChange my view.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "4  Edit: Ok, this has been fun and some great conversation, but I am beginning to feel like a one-man army trying to defend the gates of Sparta. \\n\\nI have changed my mind for three reasons. \\n\\n1) Test-taking ability is not necessarily an indication of one's ability to run the office of the president. \\n\\n2) He who creates the questions dictates the barrier for entry. \\n\\n3) Freedom of speech is a slippery slope, and even though announcing one's intent to run for president can and will continue to be abused, you can't knock out one brick and expect the wall to remain intact. Therefore, I am hereby announcing my bid to run as VP with Kim Kardashian. \\n\\nI still believe standardized cognitive testing should be administered. This could be automated, perhaps using open-source N-Back software or various standardized cognitive testing designed to screen for early cognitive decline. \\n\\nRegardless of who you like, this is a democracy, so register to vote and get those ballots in by November! \\n\\n---- Original Post ----\\n\\nThe office of the President of the United States is being used as a tool to boost social media presence, to syphon votes, and to simply sell products. This is an abuse of the office of the presidency and should be illegal, especially if someone has zero intent on running or winning. \\n\\nTo limit entry into this field, and to limit the abuse of power that has been recently demonstrated by Kanye West, it should be illegal to announce you are running for president unless you undergo a comprehensive set of exams that show you have at least a basic mental competency to run the United States of America. \\n\\nThe results of these exams should be available to everyone as a pass/fail, though the exact scores should be held secret so as not to be used to favor one candidate with a higher score over another. They should cover cognitive, physical, as well as brain scans using MRI, EEG, etc.\\n\\nWhile these tests may not completely stop such abuse, they would make it far more difficult for any celebrity to simply announce to their millions of Twitter followers that they are running for president. More importantly, voters could be assured that any candidate running for president has passed a basic competency exam, which would prevent candidates from using perceived cognitive decline as a political weapon.   \n",

First, he may have an excentric take on reality but can't honestly believe that he has a chance of winning. Second, if he truly wanted to be president, he would have started his campaign last year when he still had a chance to get on state ballots. Third, he has been an avid defender of Trump and the MAGA agenda. Just from reviewing other threads on reddit, there are people willing to vote for him. Generally speaking, the fan base of artists like Kanye skews young and culturally diverse, which are both not likely to vote for Trump. \\n\\nThere are plenty of other reasons you can say that Kanye is running, but unless you say how my view is flawed I will only consider those reasons as supplemental to the above concept and not as a replacement for.\\n\\nEDIT: Interesting.... https://www.thedailybeast.com/billionaire-kanye-wests-company-yeezy-llc-gets-multimillion-dollar-ppp-loan-from-trump-admin?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=webfeeds</td>\n",

I must be missing it, because any time I try to research into a topic I get lost in opinion and bias. \\n\\nI am completely willing to hear and review and accept any examples of success or lasting positive change that has come about as a direct result of Trumps presidency. In fact I want to! It can’t be ALL bad.\\n\\nEdit1: a lot of responses here. I need to actually read the sources for the claims everyone’s making, so it may take a while for me to respond to each comment, but I will try. I’ll take this chance to remind everyone it’s possible to have civil discourse about even the most divisive topics, even the infamous DJT. Thanks all for the responses.\\n\\nEdit2: double thanks to those who are responding and engaging one another civilly, and awarding the post. I think it’s important to realize how biased we can become despite the facts. The good things don’t necessarily outweigh the bad, so maybe there’s a counter-post to be made regarding all of the harm DJT has done as well. Every point has a counter point, so take anything you hear with the ole’ grain of salt. I urge everyone to educate themselves and vote in the upcoming election for the candidate they believe in - and don’t let politics negatively impact your happiness. It’s just like any other thing, and can be harmful in high doses.\\n\\nEdit3: definitely had my view changed. I wanted examples of positives and I received examples with sources. I appreciate everyone’s responses, and feel better about having informed conversation about DJT’s presidency. Still have a lot to read and respond to!</td>\n",

Therefore, I am hereby announcing my bid to run as VP with Kim Kardashian. \\n\\nI still believe standardized cognitive testing should be administered. This could be automated, perhaps using open-source N-Back software or various standardized cognitive testing designed to screen for early cognitive decline. \\n\\nRegardless of who you like, this is a democracy, so register to vote and get those ballots in by November! \\n\\n---- Original Post ----\\n\\nThe office of the President of the United States is being used as a tool to boost social media presence, to syphon votes, and to simply sell products. This is an abuse of the office of the presidency and should be illegal, especially if someone has zero intent on running or winning. \\n\\nTo limit entry into this field, and to limit the abuse of power that has been recently demonstrated by Kanye West, it should be illegal to announce you are running for president unless you undergo a comprehensive set of exams that show you have at least a basic mental competency to run the United States of America. \\n\\nThe results of these exams should be available to everyone as a pass/fail, though the exact scores should be held secret so as not to be used to favor one candidate with a higher score over another. They should cover cognitive, physical, as well as brain scans using MRI, EEG, etc.\\n\\nWhile these tests may not completely stop such abuse, they would make it far more difficult for any celebrity to simply announce to their millions of Twitter followers that they are running for president. More importantly, voters could be assured that any candidate running for president has passed a basic competency exam, which would prevent candidates from using perceived cognitive decline as a political weapon.</td>\n",

Social programs could benefit greatly from these funds, and maybe we could afford to better fund national programs such as healthcare or family leave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "1  Kanye West is a shill for president Trump and running to syphon off young voters from voting for Biden. First, he may have an excentric take on reality but can't honestly believe that he has a chance of winning. Second, if he truly wanted to be president, he would have started his campaign last year when he still had a chance to get on state ballots. Third, he has been an avid defender of Trump and the MAGA agenda. Just from reviewing other threads on reddit, there are people willing to vote for him. Generally speaking, the fan base of artists like Kanye skews young and culturally diverse, which are both not likely to vote for Trump. \\n\\nThere are plenty of other reasons you can say that Kanye is running, but unless you say how my view is flawed I will only consider those reasons as supplemental to the above concept and not as a replacement for.\\n\\nEDIT: Interesting.... https://www.thedailybeast.com/billionaire-kanye-wests-company-yeezy-llc-gets-multimillion-dollar-ppp-loan-from-trump-admin?utm_source=feedly&utm_medium=webfeeds                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "2  I write this because I am tired of the wild goose chase that is finding examples of his success. Anything surrounding Donald Trump is shrouded in divisive language and biased opinions. Liberals will have you believe he has done nothing, while conservatives will tout his unlimited success. I must be missing it, because any time I try to research into a topic I get lost in opinion and bias. \\n\\nI am completely willing to hear and review and accept any examples of success or lasting positive change that has come about as a direct result of Trumps presidency. In fact I want to! It can’t be ALL bad.\\n\\nEdit1: a lot of responses here. I need to actually read the sources for the claims everyone’s making, so it may take a while for me to respond to each comment, but I will try. I’ll take this chance to remind everyone it’s possible to have civil discourse about even the most divisive topics, even the infamous DJT. Thanks all for the responses.\\n\\nEdit2: double thanks to those who are responding and engaging one another civilly, and awarding the post. I think it’s important to realize how biased we can become despite the facts. The good things don’t necessarily outweigh the bad, so maybe there’s a counter-post to be made regarding all of the harm DJT has done as well. Every point has a counter point, so take anything you hear with the ole’ grain of salt. I urge everyone to educate themselves and vote in the upcoming election for the candidate they believe in - and don’t let politics negatively impact your happiness. It’s just like any other thing, and can be harmful in high doses.\\n\\nEdit3: definitely had my view changed. I wanted examples of positives and I received examples with sources. I appreciate everyone’s responses, and feel better about having informed conversation about DJT’s presidency. Still have a lot to read and respond to!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "4  Edit: Ok, this has been fun and some great conversation, but I am beginning to feel like a one-man army trying to defend the gates of Sparta. \\n\\nI have changed my mind for three reasons. \\n\\n1) Test-taking ability is not necessarily an indication of one's ability to run the office of the president. \\n\\n2) He who creates the questions dictates the barrier for entry. \\n\\n3) Freedom of speech is a slippery slope, and even though announcing one's intent to run for president can and will continue to be abused, you can't knock out one brick and expect the wall to remain intact. Therefore, I am hereby announcing my bid to run as VP with Kim Kardashian. \\n\\nI still believe standardized cognitive testing should be administered. This could be automated, perhaps using open-source N-Back software or various standardized cognitive testing designed to screen for early cognitive decline. \\n\\nRegardless of who you like, this is a democracy, so register to vote and get those ballots in by November! \\n\\n---- Original Post ----\\n\\nThe office of the President of the United States is being used as a tool to boost social media presence, to syphon votes, and to simply sell products. This is an abuse of the office of the presidency and should be illegal, especially if someone has zero intent on running or winning. \\n\\nTo limit entry into this field, and to limit the abuse of power that has been recently demonstrated by Kanye West, it should be illegal to announce you are running for president unless you undergo a comprehensive set of exams that show you have at least a basic mental competency to run the United States of America. \\n\\nThe results of these exams should be available to everyone as a pass/fail, though the exact scores should be held secret so as not to be used to favor one candidate with a higher score over another. They should cover cognitive, physical, as well as brain scans using MRI, EEG, etc.\\n\\nWhile these tests may not completely stop such abuse, they would make it far more difficult for any celebrity to simply announce to their millions of Twitter followers that they are running for president. More importantly, voters could be assured that any candidate running for president has passed a basic competency exam, which would prevent candidates from using perceived cognitive decline as a political weapon.   \n",
