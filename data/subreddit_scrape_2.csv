CMV: Boycotting companies that exploit workers has no practical benefit,0,jfopl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jfopl5/cmv_boycotting_companies_that_exploit_workers_has/,12,2020-10-22 07:56:21,"This is a view I'd really like to have changed, because I would like to believe that I have some amount of power as a consumer. 

A few weeks ago, I bought a shirt from from a company that was super transparent about their entire manufacturing process. From the designers to the embroiderers, each worker was US based and paid a fair wage. Initially,  I was very proud to know my dollar wasn't supporting cruelty to someone else,  like some random sweatshop worker in some developing country, but the more I think about it, the more I think this wasn't a necessarily beneficial decision.

The reason these companies are able to exploit workers so terribly is because the workers have no better options.They pick on people with no other prospects and offer them table scraps for the labor they provide. But if we boycott them, the product demand decreases, and fewer manufacturing jobs would be offered in the first place. Then they would be even worse off.
 
One example of this would be [Apple](https://youtu.be/5ItLIywwepY), which treats workers so badly that they install nets that prevent suicide (instead of actually improving conditions). Would avoiding iPhones help them at all?

I think if these companies were boycotted on a large scale, of course that could be effective at waking them up. They wouldn't want to lose money.  But what can an individual do that might actually be beneficial? 

I don't know much about economics or how many of these industries work. I'm looking forward to responses that change my view.",changemyview

The front page of Reddit really isn't left. It's slightly liberal (aka spicy centrist). There are no ideals displayed through reddits censorship. What appears on the front page of Reddit seem to stand for temporary situations instead of pushing an ideology.

For example, one day you'll see a major company getting tons of slack and private and enterprise getting absolutely bashed and the next day some company will sue some poorly though of politician or donate some money and all the anti corporate sentiment will be forgotten and suddenly that one companies actions will be praised.

This is just an example both because true leftists would never praise a company for anything because they are all shit and because it shows how specific reddits censorship is.


Aside from reddits wishy washyness, when they do settle on anything for a while it's almost always a very liberal movement. For example, Reddit clearly pushes the BLM ideology along but none of the videos of protestors being brutally and inhumanely beating or otherwise injured by police make it to the popular section of Reddit.

There are countless examples of this but my point is Reddit isn't far left it's barely left and it's just liberal. You can't find a single leftist post on the popular page if you checked everyday for years.",changemyview

My view is that an abortion should need both parents' consent rather than only the mother, with a few exceptions, which are in cases of rape, when the fetus is unviable, when the mother's life is in danger, when the identity of the father is unknown, and maybe a few other extraneous cases I can't think of.

First, the most common argument against my point is that women are the ones who have to deal with pregnancy (+ all the bodily changes), and thus it should be up to them. I disagree with this point because it seems to presume that pregnancy is the most defining part about having a kid, which I think is very untrue. The 18+ years of parenting, which the father does alongside the mother, way outweighs the importance of bodily changes in my opinion.

Going along with the last argument, I refute the idea of ""my body, my choice,"" because the body in question is the child's, not the mother's (unless her life is in danger). While I agree that cases in which the mother's life is threatened should be up to her, if that is not the case, the mother's say should be about the same as the father's as they each make up half of the kid's blood.

My other problem with it is that it reinforces the stereotype that the mother is more important than the father. In society, there is a bias to motherhood over fatherhood. Many believe that a child's relationships will always and should always be stronger with their mother than their father. I think the same bias that gives women better odds in custody battles influences the debate about abortion. Some kids have closer relationships with their moms, and some their fathers, we shouldn't presume one or the other.

&#x200B;

Edit: To clairfy, because the first two responses here are both asking, I believe there needs to be consensus to get an abortion. If no consensus is reached, baby is born (save for the same circumstances I specified above).

Edit 2: I've been convinced. Someone mentioned the alternative of just letting the father opt out of the responsibilities of being one if they don't want to have the kid and while it isn't a perfect solution (I feel that there is none for this situation), it checks the most boxes possible for me. But you can debate me on that point if you want.",changemyview
CMV: Flying cars would be impractical and should never be made,12,jfll6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jfll6l/cmv_flying_cars_would_be_impractical_and_should/,34,2020-10-22 05:00:46,"Just kinda wanted to do a light-hearted topic lol.

For one, 1.35 million people die each year from car crashes; remember, we're still using ground vehicles here which can't do much structural damage most of the time. A lot of these deaths are contributed by drunk driving and general irresponsibility.

Now, imagine the pilot that's driving your jet is drunk; just completely pissed. So is the co pilot. This is a terrifying situation. For one, they'd be less likely to drive properly and may pass out. This can lead to the plane plummeting. In ground vehicles, you can rely on seatbelts and those balloon things to save you; however, when you're going down at a few hundred miles per hour, you're going to die, regardless of seatbelts. If someone passes out on the wheel due to tiredness/drunkenness, the car will go plummeting and he will die.

Seatbelts; like I said, seatbelts are useless when you're going down; your chest will still be in place but your head will go YEET, along with your other body parts. 

Along with that, if you're not wearing a seatbelt on a ground vehicle, you have a chance of surviving; if you crash into someone in a flying car and fly out, you have a much higher chance of dying due to height being mixed in with the Velocity you're flying at.

And there is a minority that are completely lost in translation. We could go deeper in the conversation but I am not sure it’s working or that’s the only way. 



I think ideologues and ideologies can be a problem in our society. 

Worldwide. 

I define ideologue as someone possessed by a caricature of an idea. 
An idea that can or cannot create a greater good for mankind. 
It might be a benefit right now for them or they might think so. 
It’s too simplified in most people’s head though and doesn’t necessarily have a practical application that can be easily demonstrated. 

An ideology for me is an idea that is not necessarily correct; sometimes because people haven’t agreed on what it means to them or they don’t understand what it means and use it anyway. 

It’s a simplification of a truth or a reality that can seem right and correct (and sometimes can be useful temporarily or as an aim) but is more of a shortcut belief with a logical/reasoning gap somewhere. 

For exemple in the way the “inequality” is framed. 

I don’t think there are any doubts that equality IS important it CAN be improved, generation after generations, over and over, equality is an idea that can generate a greater good. 

But the framing can influence the response: how do we improve equality? How do we achieve equality? Those questions will lead to possible framing: gender, race, wealth, competence, IQ, beauty, knowledge, kindness, etc... can be frames that are used to see where is equality not attained. Not present or not present enough. 

I am not sure the mainstream media is doing a fair presentation of how to work on equality. 

I think that some ideologue or ideologies or groups with ideologies (specially on the extreme right and extent left) are spitting out what they think the solution is. Sometimes without listening to the other side. 

I would love to think that there are greater/higher  roads taken (I do believe CMV is actually part of the solution here).

I have come across and participated in many discussions where democracy is seen as the best political system in the history of humanity and that suggesting any other kind of government is objectively less useful. Yeah maybe in democracy, or representative democracy if you want to get technical, the fact that general populace's interests are taken in consideration rather only the ones of the royal court or the state party is a net positive, but there are also many net negatives that balance it, such as lobbyism and also the possibility of electing people to power who will most likely underperform compared to a refined politician by trade/caste/whatever.

However political scientists have been rediscovering and developing an ancient democratic technique called [sortition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sortition). 

The basis behind sortition is simple. You choose your leaders using random selection. In the case of constructing a legislature, you randomly select around 100 to 1000 citizens. Service is paid but voluntary. Using sortition you can construct [Citizen Assemblies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_assembly) to do the legislative or decision making work. I am extremely attracted to citizen asssemblies for a variety of reasons:

Proportional Representation
---------------------------------
I am extremely attracted to these sorts of Citizen's Assembly after doing research on a variety of voting methods such as proportional representation using [STV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) or party list. Unfortunately it seems to me that all ""Proportional Representative""  (PR) methods are deficient in one way or another and do not seem to construct a representative cross section of the people. People around the world complain about the corruption of government, including countries that practice proportional representation. PR methods produce apartheid states like Israel or elect tyrants like Erdogan. 

What is the ideal proportionally representative cross section? Well, from a statistical or scientific view, the way to construct a representative sample is to draw a [random sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_\(statistics\)). So the ideal way to construct proportionally representative legislatures must be through random selection. 


Quality of Work
------------------
Citizen assemblies are not a shower-thought of mine but have been empirically studied by people such as [James Fishkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_S._Fishkin). Citizen assemblies use a process of [deliberative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy) to arrive at conclusions. Citizen assemblies have been constructed throughout the world, including America, Canada, France, Ireland, Belgium, Mongolia, Tanzania, China, etc. An important component of these studies is to observe what quality of work is output from these assemblies. Indeed researchers observe that after deliberation, the assembly is capable of changing their mind and reaching new conclusions. Work by the Citizen's assembly was for example instrumental in the [legalization of abortion and gay marriage in Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens%27_Assembly_\(Ireland\)).
Assemblies in Ireland, France, and UK have urged their countries to implement carbon taxes, advocate for fossil fuel regulations, and become a leader in climate change mitigation. I think it's apparent that Citizen Assemblies almost always make superior decisions compared to the comparatively ignorant general voting population. 

Ineptitude of the Status Quo
--------------------------------
Democracy is under attack all around the world and in my opinion, for good reason. Modernity has exposed the deficiencies of modern electoral democracy. Our elected leaders are oftentimes too afraid to act for fear of losing the next election. Our voters are ignorant ([rationally ignorant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ignorance)) and vote ignorantly. The work of evaluating politicians & policy is incredibly difficult, and the news in my opinion does a mediocre job evaluating our politicians. 


Ancient Remedies
--------------------
Most people believe the government to be corrupt and captured by the powerful and wealthy elite. All of this unfortunately was predicted thousands of years ago by ancient Greek philosophers. Aristotle for example understood electoral politics to be *aristocratic* in its nature, as even 2400 years ago, elections tended to elect the rich and powerful. In contrast Athens used what Aristotle called ""radical democracy"", a system ""To rule and be ruled in Turn"". It was this *radical democracy* that guaranteed the rights of all, and folks like Plato and Aristotle thought these radical democrats over-emphasized freedom and rights. Contrary to popular belief, Athens was not run through a purely ""direct democracy"" system. Instead it was a combination of direct democracy and sortition with checks and balances. 

Athens had its own problems (particularly with mediocre decisions made by the people), which I personally blame on the time and technological limitations they used to make their decisions. In the most famous example, the Athenian people executed their entire Navy leadership after the generals *won* a critical sea battle, but failed to pick up survivors during a storm. After the execution the people came to immediately regret their decision, and therefore decided to execute the guy who made the first proposal. And with these disasters, reforms came to temper the passions of the crowd with additional check and balances. Moreover the Athenians did not seem to use modern deliberative methods to arrive at their conclusions, instead, debates were perform in enormous crowds of around 5000 people. 

Yet despite these drawbacks, there were also advantages. Political parties and factions did not form in these ""semi-direct"", ""sortition"" based democracies. Indirect lobbying also did not seem to be prevalent. In the best documented case, the silver mining business lobbied the Athenian democracy yet the democracy rejected their proposals. In direct democracy, parties do not need to form in order to concentrate power, concentrated power which is needed to win elections. Without elections, there is no need for the people to create party factions and develop electoral strategies. 

Proposals to Implement Sortition
-------------------------------------
Exactly how would sortition work in modern times? Well, for example sortition could be used to completely replace say, the US Senate and join the US House as a bicameral legislature. Critics of sortition have noted the potential for ""elite capture"" of randomly selected citizens and the potential for corruption. Therefore I think it's apt to retain some electoral democracy as as check an balance. I have also heard claims that a purely sortition-based system is prone to violent revolution, as the elites need some sort of competitive safety valve to pour their energy towards. 

Alternatively, Citizen Assemblies could be used to review referendum choices, called ""Citizen Initiative Reviews"". Or, citizen assemblies could be used as an electoral college to choose the president.

Basically we are animals and we aren't really to blame for anything we do. What we do is determined by our brains which we didn't create or choose. We don't really have free will. That's why it makes no sense to judge someone for the things they do.

i align myself mostly with the straight moderate white( brown coz am indian) male and i am concerned about my welfare first but am willing to make some compromises for overall betterment of everyone. 

with my position hopefully clear, i constantly find myself struggling to justify liberal positions because people who are apparently holding those positions. for example, i support trans rights and homosexual rights and yet, when i see people wanting to cancel Chris Pratt or JK Rowling because they apparently are below the already high set bar. 

I also find it difficult to support movements like BLM when a good chunk of people justify loot and arson as ""reparations"". i also find it distasteful to topple and vandalise statues( for context, i absolutely hate Churchill for what he did to my country but i don't support brits vandalising his statue). 

it also gets difficult to support these positions when you see people smearing everything and everyone under the sun as racist/transphobe/homophobe/fill in the blanks. 

taking cue from my original position, my personal priority is wealth accumulation and i find that there's nothing wrong in having that mindset. this is something that i also find really weird... liberals trying to pull anyone with fame/money/privilege down because they don't measure up to the random social bar invented on social media. the most recent example of that would be smear campaign against chris Pratt coz apparently, him being a christian or pro guns is unacceptable. i personally am against gun mania that America likes to engage in but i don't understand why should someone be cancelled over holding an opinion different than mine. 

lastly, i feel that this sort of toxic behavior from people preaching live and let live( which imo is the core of liberalism) pushes folks like i, who otherwise would stand with them away. folks like i either then feel fear in expressing our opinion or are straight up pushed into conservative positions because of fear of personal harm.

Just because you CAN do something doesn't mean you should.

I believe it is important to have a conversation about the Muhammed drawings and their implications, just as it is important to discuss the cultural implications and the origin of things like the 'n-word', but to show the actual drawings isn't needed to have this conversation just as you don't have to actually say the n-word in order to discuss its origin and cultural implications. 

\- You wouldn't bring a class to a bank and commit a robbery to show the class that you shouldn't do that  
\- You wouldn't dress up in full blackface to show that that is not something that should be done

To me, this is the same - you shouldn't do something to show that it's wrong.

CMV: Saying that animals are murdered/feel pain is not a reason alone to advocate for veganism and shaming non vegans for this reason is toxic,17,jf88us,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jf88us/cmv_saying_that_animals_are_murderedfeel_pain_is/,61,2020-10-21 15:18:15,"This is more specific to toxic vegans who try to shame non vegans by saying “you’re engaging in animal murder “ or whatever. I was a vegetarian for like 19 years  because of my religious family but once i to moved to the states I slowly started incorporating non vegetarian foods in my meal. I understand the whole argument that you don’t need to consume meats in order to survive and flourish. I get that. That only leaves reasons like preferences/cuisines and non vegetarian dishes along with others for why someone might consume meats. But if you’re a vegan for the sole reason that you cannot live with the idea of consuming a dead animal (this is ok I guess ) BUT AT THE SAME TIME try to shame other people for this reason then you are wrong and toxic. Again, veganism is okay. It should be choice and I also agree dastardly treatment of animals that are bred for consumption is bad and there needs to be reform. Being vegan because you can’t stand the idea of an animal getting killed is also okay maybe you can’t stand blood or something but that is no reason to shame others at all here’s why: 

1.	Plants are living beings too.  They are made of cells. They know when they are in danger and a lot of plants have defense mechanism to prevent animals from eating them. Onions release a gas to prevent predators , peppers are spicy to prevent predators and there is a literal plant called shame plant or the touch me not plant that folds itself to protect itself when touched or shaken. So if you don’t want animals to be food for people then you also can’t have plants be food for people. Before you say “oh plants don’t feel pain blah blah “ so like would you eat a chicken or it was born with a genetic defect that made it not have a nervous system ? If pain is the reason you don’t want to consume animals would eat non vegan if an animal was killed in a way it didn’t feel pain and it was swift and instant ? Before you say, for some weird reason ,  “ oh plants can’t talk blah blah “ yeah well animals can’t either and if you meant communicate then plants do communicate with each other to tell each other about dangers and stuff. 
2.	Carnivores and Omnivores in the animal kingdom other than humans literally kill other animals for food and sometimes eat them alive even. This is how it’s been for millions of years and this is how the human species has survived for so long. Would you shame a bear for being an omnivore? I guess you could say other animals aren’t intelligent and we can make the decision to just survive on plants. But clearly human digestion allows meat digestion and survival off it. We have features of a predator. So nature allows us to hunt for survival. Now we can CHOOSE to not consume meat but again it’s a choice. This is no grounds to shame others. 



A little background on why I’m mad because of this : the team I work with at work decided to meet a coworkers place to work on some things it was easier than going into a teams call and constantly asking to go around sharing screens plus we got to meet each other. So when we were ordering pizza a coworker tried to shame me and another coworker (like really hard ) by saying something along the lines of  “by empowering companies purchasing non vegan options you are engaging in the murder of millions of animals.” Then after some banter goes on to say “would you ever kill your pet and eat them ?” . That one got me really pissed off. 


So in the off chance someone actually reads this. Change my view so I can clear my bias or something or maybe another perspective.

The grandfather paradox is that if you go back in time, and kill your grandfather (or prevent him from meeting your grandmother), then you would not have been born. If you are not born, then how can you travel back in time? It is a contradiction.

One way around this contradiction is if there's a parallel universe. The argument is that, well you actually would go back in time and prevent yourself from being born in an alternate universe.

As a preliminary statement, I want to clarify that I'm referring to those who eat meat while having reasonable access to other options. I'm talking about meat eating for people who shop at a supermarkets with plant foods and such, not people who would otherwise die from hunger or something. 

I know he's joking here, but is he wrong? Why support harming an animal in one way but oppose it in another? 

I think a likely argument will be that one action is done for a purpose, eating them, getting nutrients,  while the other causes needless harm. But I'd argue that the purpose in each situation is equivalent. If you can be healthy without eating animals, then ultimately meat eating is done for pleasure. So is fucking a goat. Why is one pleasure justifiable, but not the other? 

Another likely argument I think is that bestiality causes worse psychological harm than just death. That's possible, I guess, but you can't really verify. I think if I were a goat I'd rather live, but since we can't ask them, it's impossible to qualify one harm as worse than the other.

Also, most of you have been confusing pedophiles with child molesters. Child molesters are the people who go out and sexually abuse children, Pedophiles are just people who get turned on by children and may or may not feel compelled to sexually abuse children. While there is some overlap, it's not universal, as most child molesters are motivated by a desire for power, control and domination, not misaimed sexual urges.

With that out of the way, let's dive right in:

As the title would suggest, I believe that pedophiles should not be hated as long as they indulge in their desires in ways that don't directly harm children.

I believe that lolicon/shotacon hentai is perfect for this(along with other types of animated CP), as it gives pedophiles an outlet for their desires in a legal way and, thanks to it being animated, no real children are being harmed in the making of it, unlike with actual child porn. Not to mention, there's no provable connection between viewers of lolicon/shotacon hentai and people who later go on to commit child sex crimes. If anything, consumption of lolicon/shotacon hentai is probably reducing the amount of child sex crimes happening in the world, especially in Japan where it's created.

There may also be other non-children-harming ways for pedophiles to indulge in their desires that I don't know about. If there are, it would probably be a good idea to point them out for me.

For example, I live right next to Fort Benning, Georgia, named in honor of Confederate General Henry L. Benning. Before the war, Benning was known for being a staunch supporter of the institution of slavery, and made no secret of his belief that treating blacks as equal to whites would be detrimental to to the future of the nation, as revealed in the following statement from his 1861 speech to Confederate delegates in Virginia: 

“If things are allowed to go on as they are, it is certain that slavery is to be abolished. By the time the North shall have attained the power, the black race will be in a large majority, and then we will have black governors, black legislatures, black juries, black everything. Is it to be supposed that the white race will stand for that? It is not a supposable case.... War will break out everywhere like hidden fire from the earth, and it is probable that the white race, being superior in every respect, may push the other back.... We will be overpowered and our men will be compelled to wander like vagabonds all over the earth; and as for our women, the horrors of their state we cannot contemplate in imagination. That is the fate which abolition will bring upon the white race.... We will be completely exterminated, and the land will be left in the possession of the blacks, and then it will go back to a wilderness and become another Africa.... Suppose they elevated Charles Sumner to the presidency? Suppose they elevated Fred Douglass, your escaped slave, to the presidency? What would be your position in such an event?

Now I dunno about you guys, but I don’t feel that a man who turned his back on his fellow Americans explicitly because of his opposition to the idea of racial equality is the kinda guy who deserves to be memorialized by putting his name on an American military base. This makes about as much sense as naming an installation after King George III, Adolf Hitler, Emperor Hirohito, Kim-Il Sung, Saddam Hussein, or Osama bin Laden. I think it’s high time for a name change or two, and I believe that the most appropriate thing to do would be to honor the contributions of African-Americans who risked their lives to defend the American way of life. One name I believe would make a perfect replacement for Fort Benning is Austin Dabney. Dabney was born a slave in North Carolina, joined the cause of the Patriots serving in the Georgia militia during the American Revolution, was wounded at the battle of Kettle Creek, and spent the rest of his life after the war as a free man living a very prosperous life.

In this day and age, especially with racism becoming such a hot-button issue, I see absolutely no reason to to continue honoring the memories of defenders of slavery.",changemyview
"CMV: The use of the term ""zero emission"" for electric vehicles is incredibly misleading, borderline false advertising",15,jf4fco,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jf4fco/cmv_the_use_of_the_term_zero_emission_for/,19,2020-10-21 10:30:50,"To start, I believe that saying a car is ""zero emission"" is borderline false advertising. 

**False advertising** can be defined as ""the crime or tort of publishing, broadcasting, or otherwise publicly distributing an advertisement that contains an untrue, misleading, or deceptive representation or statement which was made knowingly or recklessly and with the intent to promote the sale of property, goods, or services to the public.""

Regardless of the legality of the use of the term ""zero emission"", this advertising tactic is very misleading and even deceitful. In my head, as a consumer, the term ""zero emission"" means just that -- *no emissions*. Despite the implication of this term, literally everything ever made produces emissions. That's simply how life on earth works.

Before someone jumps to correct me, yes, I know that there is a definition of ""zero emission."" It is stated as so: ""denoting a road vehicle that emits no pollutants from its exhaust."" My point here is that this term, while given a definition, is misleading to the consumer, which can actually be harmful to the environment. **When people** ***think*** **they're buying environmentally friendly products and are ""saving the planet,"" they feel complacent, leading to inaction.**

Now, back to my main point:  
Companies like Tesla, GM, and Ford all use the term. It's become universal in automotive industry marketing. Little do these companies do to mention that the production of a large lithium-ion battery requires an incredible bit of energy. For example, the production of a lithium-ion light electric vehicle battery releases nearly 200 kilos of CO2 per kWh battery. The Tesla Model 3 contains, at the *minimum*, a 54 kWh battery, resulting in the emission of 8-10 tons of CO2, *just from production.*

For comparison, [epa.gov](https://epa.gov) states that a typical (gas-powered) passenger vehicle (achieving 22mpg) produces approximately 4.6 metric tons of CO2 per year. Yes, this is obviously a lot more than electric, but that's not the point here.

Additionally, don't forget that the electricity to charge the car has to be generated from somewhere, and this is often via excessive carbon-emitting processes. **And the United States still generates 80% of its energy from fossil fuels**.

So, while *more* environmentally friendly than gas-powered vehicles, electric vehicles still produce a crap ton of CO2, and it is very misleading to say that are ""zero emission.""",changemyview

More people emigrate and many don’t transition into the countries culture and hold on to their own traditions. In the beginning there will be the case of the perfect multicultural country but with generations the countrie’s culture will faid as it doesn’t represent the majority of the people and the culture of immigrants won’t be the culture of their children as they didn’t grow up in that enviroment. Then there will begin a new culture but it wont be multicultural, it will just be a new culture.  And most countries will have a similar culture as different ideas from different cultures will coexist and form a new normal.

This might also have to do with the media as people from countries that teach english seem to be more influenced by english speaking countries (like media and film). I’m not trying to say that multiculturalism is bad but that years of tradition and culture might be coming to an end. I understand that a country always changes, adapts and benefits from different cultures for its way of living, eating, clothing and more. I am just making a point that the cultures we have now will be lost in the perfect multicultural world/country as it won’t be multicultural but a new culture. 

Btw, the US is not an example of this as their culture has always been multicultural from the beginning with different settlers in different states, slavery and where most people emegrated to. However britain, although has a very strong emigration history like the US, they obviously had a way longer history and already formed their culture (and have a way of living that distuingishes them.)

TLDR:Multiculturalism only exist for so long. The future can’t be multicultural, countries will change and adapt their way of living and therefore creating a new culture of their citizens.

The most recently added troll faction is like Jamaican + Aztec stereotypes with a problem with blood magic. 

[The Tauren](https://images.app.goo.gl/sJFukBGBPhSPXDT17) all act like a stereotypical Native American chief would in a 1970s western film, live in tents, build totem poles, and run around with carbon copies of Native American feathered headdress.

Look, I get that anyone creating a world as large and lore-rich as WoW is gonna have to draw some inspiration for some of the in-world cultures from real life cultures, and that's fine. But WoW seems to very frequently just wholesale rip cheap stereotypes of real cultures and apply it to in game cultures in a way that its hard to see as anything but racist. 

I'm also not suggesting that WoW be ""canceled"" or anything it just seems like a lot of the cultures are based on racist stereotypes and they were probably walking a pretty thin line with PC culture back in 2004 when the game first came out but its 2020 now and they should work to gradually phase some of this stuff out. They've already changed a lot with the game *and* several cultures they've created (undead, Drained, etc) don't even vaguely resemble real world cultures, much less be wholesale ripoffs of them, so clearly its possible for Blizzard to make a diverse and interesting world without resorting to anything like ""lol we'll just make trolls be exactly like super stereotypical jamacians but with green skin and tusks.""

We  agree that on-line forums exacerbated this significantly, right?  To the  point of shooters/violence/political disinformation campaigns.

What  I'm seeing lately are teens spending a whole heck of a lot MORE  time on forums seeking social interaction.  And out of this, I'm hearing  from parents about extremes regarding gender identity.  I've browsed  some of the absolute worst discord servers I've seen by any topic where  kids are being encouraged strongly in images, peer pressure and mental  manipulation.  I know there are valuable and supportive forums as well, however the existence of these other venues replicate many of the radicalizations commonly seen.  A thread seems to be identity seeking for those who feel lost.

If we argue the equivalency of various  radicalization I think it becomes a different discussion.  If we argue  which versions of hate or violence are better or worse, or which  externalities cause internal extremes in others we also go down a  different debate.  Not all right-wing extremes are violence, not all who  may become shooters do.  But the change in a person, the depth and  extent, are comparable.

Now, any  of this one could argue that the change in the person came from within.   But that too could be applied to issues labelled ""right"" as much as  ""left"".

My sister was also radicalized by the eating disorder world and  succeeded at it, dying at age 27.  So note that internal harms are not  devoid of mortal outcomes at all.  Suicide is also germane to all forms  of radicalization.

Sure, in America a lot of cities seem to be laid out in square blocks (UK citizen, apologies if this is a misconception) which would seem to make it easy to run around and get to the rear of the phalanx. However, the numbers of those in the mass gatherings who would think to do such a thing would likely be pretty low.

From the third rank back the elongated batons would be raised, providing protection from missiles, just like in history.

Obviously police numbers would need to be bolstered to sustain a couple of these formations at any one time, however training for the formation would be relatively simple.

I disagree for the following reasons:

* This is lowering the bar. This is often what lies at the heart of 'anti-racism.' An indirect admission that *they believe* these ethnic groups are unable to perform at the same level as their peers. Instead of placing the responsibility on the individuals/groups they simply create conditions in which students cannot fail. 
* There is absolutely nothing race-centric regarding attendance, cheating and late-work. Calling disparities in these outcomes 'racist' is disingenuous because it implies certain ethnic groups are being targeted and intentionally failed. It is artificial victimhood the operates under the idea that any disparity in performance must be attributed to racism or targeted harm and rejects individual responsibility. Nothing about this is ""anti-racist.""
* Undermines all students in the system, not just under-perfoming ones. Delinquent values will be instilled in all students. It undermines values essential to social success such the ability to be reliable, complete a task within a specific timeframe, trustworthiness etc...values that are very important for ones success outside of the classroom.
* Under-prepares for college and work, there is no cushion or buffer in the real world. Their failures here will again be attributed to ""racism"" which will then require government or bureaucratic oversight to correct. (Can't fire someone for not showing up to work, can't fire someone for stealing from the workplace etc...)
* This is not a problem the school board is equipped to address. Their responsibility is to provide a quality education with the tools to help children success, not manipulate the system to achieve artificial success rates.

Actually this opinion used to be quite common about 40 years ago. In fact most people believed it (so odds are your parents did and may still). I wouldn't come here if I could have organically found someone who could argue against it, but usually when confronted with the view people tend to either scream until I'm banned, promise to argue against it later (and never do), or simply ignore it (fair enough). 

I want to soap-box as little as possible given how controversial it is. It can be summed up succinctly with the 2%/40% stat (although I'm sure the specifics are somewhat off). The 2%/40% stats refers to a commonly cited statistic that says that bisexual/gay men account for 2% of the population, but 40% of pedophiles. Again, I'm sure the specifics of that statistic are off, but it seems to me currently that it has some elements of truth. Essentially, gay and bisexual men are overrepresented among pedophiles as a proportion of the population. So far, research I've found has seemed to support this view (the post cites some sources I've used in making this view). So far I have no seen anything to suggest that the disproportionate targeting of the sex of the perpetrator is not occurring (although, again, I'm open to change if that's wrong). A common counter-argument is that people who target their own sex are not really gay. This is incredibly strange to me (but again, I'm open to change). 

From the post I've linked:

>Basically the counter-argument that is often made is that gay men who molest boys aren't really ""gay."" For example, one of the sources says, ""and the adult male who sexually molests young boys is not likely to be homosexual."" That is, even if they are literally having sex with a member of their own sex, they are considered ""not homosexual"" by researchers. Instead, these ""sexologists"" argue that pedophilia is about ""power"" (which they also argue for rape) and therefore the sex is irrelevant. In their minds, if the pedophile is married to a woman, he's not in the closet or bi, he's a straight man who, for whatever reason, is also attracted to little boys.

I genuinely want to change my view. It's horrible knowing that gay men are so overrepresented as a pedophiles. It has certainly made me homophobic, even though I really wasn't before. In my current mindset, I would never, ever allow a gay man to have unsupervised access to my child.

CMV: A melting pot is superior to multiculturalism and is the inevitable result of cultures coming together,19,jepuv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jepuv2/cmv_a_melting_pot_is_superior_to_multiculturalism/,51,2020-10-20 21:50:35,"Culture is a grouping of ideas unique to a certain group. These ideas can exist independently of each other. You can be Muslim without speaking Arabic, you can eat Italian food without admiring Italian architecture, you can admire Notre Dame without being Christian. These ideas do not have to be bundled.

Cultural boundaries only exist because of ignorance. 300 years ago, the reason Chinese people ate Chinese food wasn't because they thought it was superior to all other food or because it's special to them, but because it's all that was available. 

Now, in the first world, everyone has knowledge and access to nearly every element of every other culture. I can eat Greek food one day, Chinese the next, and Japanese the day after. When people of different cultures are allowed to exist side by side like this, mixing is inevitable and good. Chinese people should have access to Italian food. French people should have access to Indian fashion. American people should have access to Tibetan Buddhism.

The world becomes better when people are allowed to use and build on the ideas of others. Walt Disney was American and the story of Snow White was German. If he only had access to his own culture, the world would have never have had Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs. Italians would have never created pasta had they not had access to Asian noodles. Buddhism could never have existed without Hinduism. There is no reason people should not be able to adopt and improve upon the ideas of other cultures.

&#x200B;

**Counter Arguments**

**Cultures will be lost:** 

So long as all cultures start out on equal footing, this won't be a problem. So long as people value some aspect of culture, it will be preserved. If no one values it, why should it be preserved? No one mourns the loss of the Aztec tradition of human sacrifice.

**Some ideas are diminished when separated:**

If hijabs and Islam go hand in hand, people who adopt one will likely adopt the other. It's that simple.

**Aspects of culture will be diminished:**

If there's a conflict (e.g. dress x should only be worn on occasion y vs dress x is beautiful and should be worn at any time) the more popular side should and will win. When that girl on Twitter was chastised for wearing a Chinese dress to prom because she made it less special by wearing it outside the appropriate occasions, that's a valid part of cultures mixing. If people decide that something should be reserved for a special occasion or x and y should be bundled with z, they should and will apply social pressure to maintain that. How effective this social pressure is will be proportional to the number of people offended and the amount of offence. This means that a large group of people or a small group of very passionate people will get their way. This is a good way to ensure the maximum amount of good is extracted from each element of culture.

**Why should x get y from culture z:**

No one deserves anything from any culture. You shouldn't have more of a right to anything because of the circumstances of your birth. Unless you specifically created some aspect of culture, you don't get to claim ownership over it.",changemyview

I think this is an outright ridiculous position to hold in an argument. In a democratic nation, especially during election years, politics should be EVERYWHERE. Whether this is protests, political advertisment, personal opinions, or even outright bullshit—it should be injected into your regular entertainment. 

I'll use my country for an example but this can be extrapolated to any democratic nation. I believe personally, although not supported by any facts at all, that the majority of the people that hold these positions are conservatives in the USA. I don't mean to attack conservatives at all, or generalize them, but if there is someone out there that holds this mindset could they rectify this argument for me?

If you support 100% that voting is a right and a duty as a citizen of a nation where you are able to choose your representatives that very may well make an immediate impact on your life, why is it so difficult to accept a little information in sports, tv, and other non-political outlets? If you don't agree with that info, sure thing. That's your opinion to hold. I am not questioning your beliefs in that regard, but rather why others should be restricted from describing their beliefs in a non-political way is so ""anti-everybody"". 

I think during election cycles politics should be readily infused into every voters entertainment outlets. Everyone should see everything. I think it encourages voting in general, helps educate the population on candidates that otherwise wouldn't seek out this information directly, and helps to keep the country together and more informed. 

As an American, saying politics doesn't belong in ""my football"" is anti-american to me. It's anti-democratic. Politics belongs in everything in an inherently political state. 

If you personally can't handle hearing about opinions that you may not agree with, or are too lazy or just feel like it's a waste of your precious time to get educated about your future leaders, you're the one in the wrong.

I am a big Bernie fan and have already voted for Biden. I lean pretty left on most issues.

I think it would be fair if the Democrats added two more justices. But I don't think it is best for our country long-term. It would be another partisan move in an already extremely divided country. Eventually (4, 8, or maybe in 20 years) Republicans will come back into power and could make a similar move. It would also put Democrat senators in red states in a bad situation.

Here is my recommendation: Democrats bring a constitutional amendment limiting the supreme court to nine justices, placing term limits on current and future justices, and bringing back the 60 vote requirement for Senate confirmation. At the same time Democrats should also bring forth a bill proposing to increase the number of justices. Essentially, Republicans would be forced to choose between helping to pass the amendment or having the number of justices increased if it fails.

I feel the Republicans come out ahead right now with such an amendment. But it seems like a huge positive for the future of our country. The court would likely not get individuals like Kavanaugh or Barrett. It would be less susceptible to hyper-partisanship.

As a white male I can afford this strategy of playing it slow. I think it is completely valid others feel they can't do the same. I also accept that others feel 9 justices are not enough to accurately represent our diverse country. I don't know what the correct number would be. Perhaps we add 2 more justices every 50 years?

CMV: Breaking Bad is better than Avatar: The Last Airbender,0,jeccr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jeccr1/cmv_breaking_bad_is_better_than_avatar_the_last/,25,2020-10-20 06:23:38,"Last summer, I watched two incredible shows on Netflix: *Community* and *Avatar: The Last Airbender*. Whoever put them on Netflix is the GOAT. They were both great, but not the best series I've seen.  In my humble opinion, the greatest series of all time is *Breaking Bad*.

*Airbender* has everything: great animation, great set pieces, great worldbuilding, great story, great themes and, most importantly, great characters. The character arcs in the show are nuanced and compelling for an older audience, but simple enough for younger viewers to understand. The political, social and philosophical themes have much relevance today, weather its about finding hope in our trauma, finding a family, or understanding the dark implications of imperialism, colonialism and genocide. Bending is awesome, a simple but engaging magic system that adds nuance and flavor to the world. And the characters themselves are three-dimensional, engaging and real. Zuko's character arc is one of my favorite stories ever now, second only to that of Walter White. Which brings me to...

*Breaking Bad*. This show has great characters, great themes, great symbolism, great worldbuilding and a great story. What makes it better than *Airbender*, however, is the character drama and development of said characters. The storylines in *Breaking Bad* feel much more gritty and deep than the ones in *Airbender*, and the character arcs are much more meaningful and compelling. Walter's story is equal parts satisfying, hilarious, saddening and tragic. His character arc from weak to dangerous, all in the pursuit of validation through blood, meth and tears, is so rewarding to watch, and there is so much depth beneath the surface of the show.

But this is what really puts the *Breaking Bad* ahead of *Airbender* for me: the former doesn't pull its punches. That isn't to say *Airbender* isn't heavy or gut-wrenching at times, but *Breaking Bad* is much more dark and gritty. By the time the show ends, >!only Jesse is able to find a happy ending: everyone else is worse off than before!<. Yes, *Airbender* gets dark at times. Between >!Zuko's Agni Kai with Azula, Aang being responsible for the Air Nomad Genocide, Katara blaming herself for her mother's death, and the death of Iroh's son Lu Ten!<, there are lots of dark episodes and themes in *Airbender*. However, at the end of the series, everybody ends up in a better place. Everybody except >!Azula and Ozai!< get happy endings. By contrast, *Breaking Bad* ends with >!Hank and Walter dead, Skyler and Marie widowed, Walter Jr. and Holly orphaned, Saul in hiding and Jesse barely escaping with his life!<.

This is why I prefer *Breaking Bad* as opposed to *Avatar: The Last Airbender*. Because while both are great, ultimately *Breaking Bad* is unwilling to tread lightly.

Not everybody is going to share my opinion, and I wanted to see if anybody thought differently. I understand that, given the acclaim both shows have received, it is likely that there will be differing viewpoints on this topic. Please NOTE: I have not seen season 5 of *Better Call Saul*, *Avatar: The Legend of Korra* or any of the marketing for season 3 of *Cobra Kai*, season 2 of *The Mandalorian* or *WandaVision*. If you feel the need to mention any of these in the comments, please mark them with spoiler flair.

TL;DR: *Avatar: The Last Airbender* and *Breaking Bad* are both great, but I belive the latter is superior because it doesn't pull its punches. Mark information regarding season 5 of *Better Call Saul*, *Avatar: The Legend of Korra* or any of the marketing for season 3 of *Cobra Kai*, season 2 of *The Mandalorian* or *WandaVision* as spoiler, please.",changemyview

Having that out of the way, i read a story about a girl who went out with this guy and they had a great time in their (first) date, because of that the girl invites the guy to her place and after a brief hang out they start making out. Things get pretty hot/serious, guy slips his hand under her shirt and she declines, guy respects it but goes like ""wtf"", long story short they have a short argument and the guy gets upset and leaves, calling her a ""tease"". 

In the comments everyone was calling the guy a creep, a POS, a loser, etc... Granted, the ""tease"" was totally out of line, but it made me think if the guy had any right to get upset/frustrated in this situation.  I do believe that if you're this guy you should respect the girl, not push it, *and not be a dick about it*. But i also don't think the guy is completely out of line in being frustrated/upset, i think it's at least a little bit *understandable*.

The reason why i believe this is through a similar situation in which someone leads you on outside the bedroom, and no, i'm not talking about ""she was nice to me, how could she reject me"" none of that niceguy bs. I'm talking someone who does things that solely rely on the technicality of their actions to escape reproach, sometimes these things happen by accident, more than once i've heard a friend of mine tell another ""dude you're leading her on..."" or something like that. In this situation, upon confession of one's feelings to the 'lead-on', it's normal and *understandable* to think this person would experience quite a bit of frustration upon rejection, and that the 'lead-on' should be more aware of their actions so as to no...well...lead people on. (At least this is my understanding, i accept i could be wrong).

Now, i don't wanna come off as some sexual harassment apologist. Again, if you get rejected in either of these situations you should take things with grace and maturity, not berate the other person, and move on, always respecting the other person's decisions. But this is your external behavior, which you have control over, but your internal feelings not so much, so that is the question, if someone builds you up sexually is it understandable to feel frustrated.

However, the problem is that there are terrible things in history that, in the past, were the status quo. The most prolific examples might be surrounding the topic of racial inequality.

Thomas Jefferson owned hundreds of slaves, and he benefitted from slavery quite a bit. However, as awful as it is, that was very normal for a rich man of the time period. That was what he had been surrounded with his whole life. That was all he knew.

When people in 2020 go back and criticize someone like Thomas Jefferson, they take the moral high ground over him. They're saying ""I am a better person than him."" But the matter of fact is, if these people had been born into the same environment and conditions as Jefferson, they would have owned slaves as well.

Furthermore, we don't know what people in the future will be criticizing about today's morality. It may be hard to imagine, but in the future, people will be just as critical of things that are normal today as we are critical of slavery today.

We have a lot of reasons to be grateful for Thomas Jefferson. The United States, and democracy in general, would not be as it is today if not for Jefferson's voice.

I’m used to Xbox parties being very toxic, so it is a nice change to see people make an effort to be kind and non-discriminatory. As a woman I especially really appreciate this.

After playing Among Us for a few hours last night with a group of the same people, a man in our chat with a heavy Indian accent got up to do something momentarily. He forgot to mute himself and we heard him loudly singing a rap song, using the n word several times. 

When he came back he realized what happened because everyone got a bit uncomfortable. One girl in particular, who again had been playing with the guy for a few hours at this point, was getting pretty upset with him. The thing is, he didn’t put up a fight at all. He apologized profusely and said he would never have said that unmuted. It didn’t make a difference to her, she left. I asked where he was from, and he said he was living in the Netherlands. I’m assuming he immigrated there maybe because like I said, heavy Indian accent. 

I want to make it clear I’m not defending usage of the word, especially as an American white woman. But that’s because I grew up in a racist culture and I’ve heard white people many times in my life display racism and using that word in an discriminatory context. I understand the full weight of this word, as much as I can as a white person. I also understand why the fellow American girl was upset, without knowing her race.

But this guy has probably never lived around black people in his entire life in those countries. I can’t say for sure how the n word is used in non-English speaking languages nations but if I had to guess I bet he never even heard the word until he started listening to rap music. In his experience, it’s probably just a fun lyric he sings with his buddies. Like you’re really gonna slam a dude for consuming black American media without context? Shit man rap is good. 

And it’s super considerate he’s taken into account that the word is a very different meaning to other cultures, and doesn’t want to use it around Americans he talks to. 

But he slipped up! And apologized profusely!!! I get why she was upset initially but the whole black and white thinking and pushing her own American ideas on this dude is what upsets me.

Privatizing health means that hospitals will now be run more like a business where the rich get preferred treatment because they have a bank account but a person trying to live payday to payday will have to starve or die. That's if they even have insurance because just like the states I'm sure some will refuse treatment if you cant pay. The bill will go from a couple thousand  if you have to pay at all that is for a hospital stay and surgery to a couple million just for some xrays and a doctor to look at you. The UCP is a mistake and especially right now when millions are vulnerable plain and simple shameful,changemyview

&nbsp;

So first I'd like to define the difference between Human Life and a Human Being. My premise rests on defining the two separately. Let me assure you that I feel that a Human Being with a developed consciousness is irreplaceable. However, due to the recent surge in discussions on abortion, I've been hammering out the details on a premise I'd like to present here in an effort to determine any flaws in it: **Human Life has no innate value, as there are over 7 billion humans on this planet, and the Laws of Supply and Demand dictate that an unborn child therefore only holds subjective worth.**


I noticed that many people seem to innately assume that unborn children are a highly valuable commodity, which confuses me, as any of 2-4 billion women could essentially produce billions more embryos at any given time. While a specific embryo or fetus can absolutely hold subjective value to a person, which is why I support laws that punish the murder of a pregnant person as though it was a double homicide, I don't see the issue with a person choosing to rid themselves of an unwanted pregnancy; nothing of inherent or subjective value was lost. While I'm not a fan of abortions used as matter of convenience (I'd much prefer universal healthcare and a robust Sex Ed curriculum), I see an abortion as nothing more than a medical procedure with no morality involved any more than a kidney transplant is ""moral.""

So I’m here to pose this dilemma. I’ve already thought it through a bit, and it’s a view I legitimately hold, am open to changing, and also think would be fun to discuss since it deals with some complicated, over-lapping values in contemporary discourse. 

Erotic, public humiliation (The Act) is wrong because it requires attention from strangers in public, who are not consenting participants to The Act. There is no reasonable expectation for those in public to witness or be a participant in The Act, as the fetish is rare. 

The necessary condition of The Act are as follows 1) The Act must occur in a public space and 2) third parties must witness the act.

While it entirely conceivable that the first party participants - IE the humiliated and the humiliater - to obtain consent of passive participants, or that there are those who may not mind or desire to be third party participants/witnesses in The Act and would gladly be in a location where such acts occur, it seems reasonable to have designated areas so that people can fulfill their kinks without causing undue harm or discomfort to non-consenting adults and children. 

As the attention from those who reasonably would not consent is required for First Parties of The Act to be fulfilled, and there is no reasonable expectation that all individuals in a public space consent to being participants in The Act, The Act itself is wrong, should be illegal, and should only be permitted where members of the public can provide consent or have a reasonable expectation of witness The Act.

tl;dr: My view is that public, erotic humiliation is wrong because it's a sexual act that requires a third party, in public to witness the humiliating act. I specify public because this can be done in private. What I view as wrong about this, is that the first parties are deriving a sexual benefit from the act, and essentially roping in unwitting and often-times unwilling bystanders. If The Act is done in public, then there's a reasonable expectation that The Act is not being done with the consent of the third parties, and that the third parties do not have a reasonable expectation to be witnessing the act while they are out in public.",changemyview
CMV: Gender swapping a role from a book to a tv or movie adaptation is not only acceptable but often helps enhance and expand the storytelling and therefore should be encouraged.,0,je2y8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/je2y8r/cmv_gender_swapping_a_role_from_a_book_to_a_tv_or/,135,2020-10-19 22:46:09,"Request: Please use spoiler tags in any reply below where applicable.

Main thought - Does a gender swap of a major character in an adapted work violate the original work?

There have been some very prominent examples recently where a particular character's gender was swapped between the original source material and adapted version. This often evokes some form of outcry from fans of the original source, claiming it is forced diversity.

While certainly in some cases it may start (and even end!) as that, it can often lead to exploration of new concepts and differentiation/deviation from the plot of the source.

Knowing that part of the appeal of adapting a book or comic to a show or movie is drawing in fans of the original, having everything play out exactly the same way beat for beat isn't necessarily always the best.

My premise is based on two main ideas:

1. It can change up the plot enough that it allows for plot changes that keeps the story ""fresh"" even for those who have read the source material.
2. It can in fact enhance the source material to give it greater nuance or exploration of ideas, by changing up relationships between the characters and increasing the depth of the storytelling.

I'm not talking about characters where the performer was a different gender but the role wasn't re-written in any way or the story altered, or roles where gender is immaterial. An example of this is Ellen Ripley from Alien - the script famously had no genders assigned to the roles. Or the Ancient One from Doctor Strange, where there is literally nothing to the fact that the Ancient One is a Celtic woman instead of a Chinese man, other than the introduction gag.

Some of the examples that I am thinking of recently where I feel this was particularly successful:

**Lovecraft Country** \- By creating Christina as the daughter instead of Caleb the son, it set up the theme from the very beginning of a woman struggling to seize her family's legacy of magic which had been denied to her because of her gender, and then >!the relationship with Ruby that takes on a theme of identity, with how she always has relations in William's form until the very end.!<

**The Boys** \- Stormfront is a relatively generic Thor facsimile in the comics, but with a female playing the role they were able to make subverting the theme of ""girl power"" a noteworthy point, come up with a far more interesting back story, >!give a little more depth to the idea of supplanting Ryan's mother!<, and set up a great plotline with >!the romance with Homelander, which will help propel him further towards his breaking point in the coming season(s).!<

**Lost in Space** \- From a practical standpoint, any male actor would immediately be compared to Jonathan Harris' iconic performance as Dr. Smith. But it goes beyond that, to set up a completely different type of malevolent manipulation.

That said, there are an awful lot of people who decried these casting/plot choices. So, change my mind - why is it better / more important to stick exactly to the source material than do this?

EDIT: Adding one small caveat that I forgot to mention previously - this would only really apply in cases where the character's gender didn't SPECIFICALLY have a core concept in the plot of the original. Like for example ""GI Jane"" where the entire crux of the story was about a woman training to be a Navy SEAL. But as a counter-example, maybe an updated retelling of The Three Musketeers where one of them is a woman and it plays with the theme of how a woman would fit into that sort of ""all for one, one for all"" brotherhood.

That’s bogus for a lot of the country. In fact, for many Americans who live in safe states if you don’t vote 3rd party you are throwing your vote away. 

Examples of a safe state would be Alabama for Trump or California for Biden. If It’s a foregone conclusion who is going to win your state and you vote for a major party candidate, you are throwing your vote away. The popular vote means next to nothing.  Biden could win California by a 2-1 margin. If he does, no one will bat an eye, but if he wins it 58-35-7 and the Green Party got 7% that would be a big deal (or at least a bigger deal than a slightly larger margin for Biden). It would create momentum for Green Party candidates in future elections and if they could get to 5% nationwide, they would get federal funds and possibly other recognition in the next election cycle. Same thing for Alabama, you know Trump is going to win big so why not be strategic with your vote and vote Libertarian or Green or whatever 3rd party that aligns closest to your views?  

Why do I want my view changed?  I don’t really like Biden but I’d rather have Biden than Trump as president. But because I live in a “safe” state, I plan to vote for a 3rd party where the candidate aligns closer to my views. If there are downsides to voting 3rd party in this scenario, I’d like to understand what they are.

The Islamic extremists in France have caused massive loss and bloodshed, just like how Hirohito's Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and the western coast of the United States. Both incidents are awful and those responsible deserve(d) to face the consequences.
    
That being said, after both incidents, the victim nation immediately turned on the ethnicity or religion of the attackers. America put Asians into concentration camps, and France [has proposed](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/france-fights-terror-with-re-education-camps-plan-7wg9vrrgd) doing the same to Muslims. Such a plan is very similar to what China has done (to international backlash).
    
After the recent beheading, I've seen a lot of very xenophobic and concerning remarks on Reddit and social media. People have been making vast generalisations about modern Muslims and aggressive statements about what they think of them.
    
This is like hating all Africans for theft, hating all Mexicans for drugs, and hating all Arabs for terrorism. ""Blame the race/religion/sex"" is a hateful mindset that has infiltrated the United States and is slowly seeping into Europe.
    
When repeatedly wronged by members of a race/religion/sex, many people tend to blame the group the perpetrator comes from. The conclusion may seem logical at first, as it follows the trend, but correlation does not equal causation.
    
I have met plenty of Muslims, and none have been aggressive, angry, or supportive of terrorism. One even specifically condemned terrorism and said that they do not associate with extremists.
    
Unlike America, France has yet to take the plunge and turn to full-scale racism. Nonetheless, such sentiment appears to be growing, and it could spiral out of control.
    
It would not surprise me if Muslims and even Arabs in general become targets of abuse and hate in Europe, as that is exactly what happened in America post-9/11.",changemyview
CMV:The Electoral College is the tool that has given racial minorities political influence and if abolished would set the fight for racial equality back by decades.,6,je2kbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/je2kbg/cmvthe_electoral_college_is_the_tool_that_has/,51,2020-10-19 22:24:42,"With a direct democracy it becomes a quest to 50% plus 1 and the candidates have incentive to make that 51% as less diverse as possible so they can govern and ignore the 49%. The real issues is do you value democracy or do you value individual rights? The Constitution values individual rights, The Bill of Rights is extremely undemocratic. It says that no matter how big your majority is you can not set up a state religion, no matter how big your majority is you can not stop a group of people from peaceably assembling to protest actions taken by the government. 

We should also not forget that The Electoral College once allowed a president to take office with only 39% of the popular vote and, in fact did not even appear on the ballot in half of the states. That President was Abraham Lincoln. If you value minority rights you should insist that the Electoral College remain in place since you would be able to have a president who did not receive a single vote from any minority, which means that the very real concerns of minorities could be completely ignored. Where as the Electoral College guarantees representation of racial minorities since they represent a significant population in a number of key states and are able to influence where those states electoral votes go. African Americans would only represent around 7% of those casting votes in a national popular election which is not all that significant. Republicans may not get a lot of support from the black community but they have found a way to get enough black people to vote for them to tip elections in their favor. Republicans may not get a lot of support from the latino community but they get enough support to tip elections in their favor. It is impossible to win The Presidency in the Electoral College without that support.

If you believe that no person should be elected president who abjectly hates minorities then you should be absolutely terrified of an America without the Electoral College. No serious candidate has run on the platform that they are going to take away rights of minorities since they would not be able to win if they did. If we are to see Dr. Kings dream that all people should be judged exclusively by the content of their character then we should not abolish the one system that has empowered black people to leverage political power and influence public policy. The Constitution is designed to balance majority rule with minority rights and, by extension that what the Electoral College is designed to do. That is what makes The Constitution such a brilliant document and that is what makes the Electoral College such a brilliant system.

I am European, but thanks to my Mozambiquan partner I had the chance to have more than a second opinion on the matter.

In the light of the recent tweets stating that Gal Gadot as Cleopatra is a case of whitewashing and that ""Cleopatra was African-American"" (yikes), I felt compelled to share my opinion of Black America in relation to the African continent.

I'm using the Cleopatra controversy as an excuse, I will focus only on sub-Saharan Africa. This is because, unlike Northern Africa, the sub-Saharan region was the main source of slaves during the diaspora and for this reason, it's more relevant to the African-American community. Also because Cleopatra's origins are still discussed today, so there's really no point in defending or attacking Gal Gadot as Cleopatra.

Now, on with my point.

African-Americans are not Africans. Their mindset, culture, and upbringing are that of a western person and for this very reason should not attempt to appropriate \*\*another continent\*\* history. This is not pointless gatekeeping, and prove this I'll bring up an example of the damages this mindset can cause. The Black Panther case.

While the general consensus in America is that Black Panther is a culturally important film in dignifying Black America, which it is, the consensus in Africa is that the film is very demeaning and borderline insulting to the culture it's attempting to portray. Wakanda is a what if scenario in which the question asked can be summarised as ""What if Africa was extremely technologically advanced?"". This question is posed on the wrong premise. In fact, most sub-Saharan cultures give no value to technological advancement, their cultures have different priorities and they should be respected as such. 

The thesis of the film, which was made by western minds and it shows, is that a country can have dignity only if it plays along with the rules the West created (development as only criteria to evaluate culture). If Nigeria was like New York, then Nigeria would be cool.

This awfully insulting argument is caused by the fact that African-Americans, no matter how they want to reconnect with their origins, will always have a western way of thinking. Obviously, this will to reconnect with their motherland is caused by the cultural orphanage the diaspora caused. But still, it's no excuse to misunderstand or insult other cultures.

I could make many, many more examples of African-American artists missing the point and accidentally insulting African cultures to please their fellow Americans, but I'll stop here because this is getting lengthy.",changemyview

The entire article was about how he fanned the money out in a showy display. 

Full disclosure: I think President Trump is an embarassment and a destructive force who NEEDS to be voted out of office for the sake of the USA and the world at large. But I watched the video and thought: he did nothing wrong here. He MIGHT have intended to ""show off"" the \~$60 he put in the plate...but he could have just been checking how much was in his hand or fidgeting as anyone else would do. He certainly could afford to give more, but many people don't give as much money as normal (or any at all--which is fine!) when they are visiting a church. Nothing he did in the video was objectionable, and yet the article took a bunch of shots at him based on how he held his money, how little he gave, what may have been going on in his mind--a bunch of cheap shots, but more importantly, all regarding something pretty insignificant.

The problem with this kind of cheap piling on (and I could give a hundred examples) is that it's unfair and mean, and so it very much justifies the President's supporters pointing out unfair treatment, which leads to further entrenching their support of him.  Furthermore, it dilutes out and de-emphasizes all of his horrible behavior, lapses in ethics, and the terrible amount of REAL damage he's done. 

If we really want to change minds and vote him out of office--instead of having another Democrat popular vote win and a ""too close to call"" electoral college victory (for one side or the other)--we should focus on the much more significant and real damage he has done. This would help by (1) enabling much broader agreement on a set of facts; (2) avoid causing supporters of the President to dig in defensively for no reason; (3) focus on the real issues.",changemyview
CMV: Unpaid internships should NOT be illegal,0,je15nv,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/je15nv/cmv_unpaid_internships_should_not_be_illegal/,91,2020-10-19 20:58:40,"Following the recent initiative by the EU to make unpaid internship illegals, I'd like to challenge my own view on unpaid internships. Here's my reasoning:

 **Reason 1: It's all voluntary transactions. No one forces you to take internships.**

No one's stopping you from applying for paid internships. And if the only internships you can find are unpaid, then the cold hard truth is you don't deserve to be paid.

**Reason 2: Companies need to invest in interns to gain some value back, and they can only afford to pay interns if they get more than what they invest in,**

In addition, it's also about a company's profitability. Very often, in order for the company to get some value of out their interns (Even low skill jobs like flipping burgers), they need to put in a lot of trainings - to no surprise, this incurs costs to the employers. And even after training, interns are very likely to mess up due to their inexperience (which is fine), and cleaning it up also incurs cost.

Simple math: Pay = (Value added by the employee - money invested by the employer) x some factors.

That's why sometimes you even see interns have to **pay** the company they work for in order to get an internship. And that brings us to Reason #3 and #4

**Reason 3: It's all supply and demand**

Making unpaid internships illegal is not necessary. If an employer benefits from an internship, they can still afford to raise the pay from 0 to X. Let's say if an intern can add 100$ to the business, then the maximum the business can pay is 99$, and they will use salary as a way to keep bidding for interns as long as they're profitable.

And vice versa, unpaid internships are so common is because the supply of little-to-zero-value-adding interns are so big they companies don't have to bid against each other.

By the way, this applies to every kind of job in the world. You see Google pays crazy money to their employees, as they are so profitable that they can out-bid every other business in the world, and they can keep doing so. **No one's forcing them to generously pay their employees**.

**Reason 4: Inexperienced people BENEFIT from unpaid internships**

Small and medium-sized employers are more encouraged to hire interns if they don't have to pay, which opens up more opportunities for young and inexperience people to get their first step into the workplace, gain experience and prove that they can deliver something.

Think of it as free trials.

You are more willing to try out a product if you have nothing to lose, the product manufacturer can get feedback on their product and improve, potentially have you as their customer.

Employers are more willing to give inexperience people an internship if they don't have to pay, the intern can get feedback on their performance and improve, potentially land a job afterwards.",changemyview

I'll make a very simple analogy to flavor to support my view. The sense of taste is extremely subjective and personal for each individual.

He didn't make a choice to dislike vanilla or to like chocolate, but we would still say ""John prefers chocolate"" in English. 

In an extremely similar way, sexual orientation is something people just have an innate feeling about. It's not a choice. But is it wrong to call it a preference? I would say it's not offensive or outdated unless one is looking to be offended.

Again, my position is about the usage of language, not about whether or not sexual orientation is a choice. Like I said, I don't think preferences are choices. Here are some more examples:

Lack of asian presence in corporate position. Provide evidence that this is not because their culture fosters reservation, but rather because their employer is discriminatory towards Asians and doesn't like hiring them.

Lack of presence of white and asian people in football and basketball. Prove that this is because the NBA and the NFL do not like whites, and would rather hire blacks, and not because whites perform worse at physical activity and so are less likely to get the position on the team.

Optional: Blacks receiving longer sentencing for crimes. Provide evidence this is because the judge/jury knows the defendant is a black person and sentences him longer for that, and not because black people are more likely to be born into poverty so will have a worse attorney, blacks are more likely to have committed more priors, etc.

I've often seen it claimed on reddit and IRL that it's nearly impossible to use violence to bring change in western democracies, and that doing so will result in more problems. However, there are numerous examples, so I'm only going to choose ones from 1990/the last 30 years. If we can, keep discussion within the last 30 years and in western democracies (ie Western Europe, Canada, USA, Australia and New Zealand)

* 1990: Armed indigenous protesters in Canada block construction of a golf course on sacred land, win a shootout with police and survive a siege led by the military, they hold off construction \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oka_Crisis)\]
* 1995: Indigenous protesters in Canada manage to occupy a park that had been stolen from indigenous people and resist police attempts to evict said occupation \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipperwash_Crisis)\]
* 2006: Youth workers protest across France in response to deregulation of labor law, the law is later reversed due to the protests \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_youth_protests_in_France)\]
* 2012: Student protests in Quebec, Canada rioted across the province due to an increase in tuition fees for university, and eventually led to a tuition freeze and new government \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Quebec_student_protests)\]
* 2013: Protesters in Brittany, France destroy cameras and toll booths to protest a new tax on trucks. The tax was later abandoned within a month \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnets_Rouges)\]
* 2014: Protesters in Spain stop a road development project that would've gotten rid of free parking spaces and increased property prices by burning lots of things down \[[Wikipedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflicto_de_Gamonal_de_2014)\]
* 2014: Armed protesters in the USA engage in a standoff with police and as far as I can tell, win \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundy_standoff)\]
* 2014: Protesters in Spain stop the eviction of a popular squat by rioting and burning down construction equipment \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_Vies)\]
* 2018: Riots across France that started over a car tax lead to the cancellation of said tax \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_vests_movement)\]
* 2020: George Floyd Protests in the USA saw people burning down police stations, which has forced an international conversation about police brutality and numerous cities are cutting police funding, with Minneapolis disarming some of them, although most protests have been peaceful, I think it's worth noting that changes only started happening when protests got violent and national, unless I've misunderstood the situation (I'm not from the US) \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests)\]

In contrast, the biggest nonviolent protest in history was a huge failure. The protests against the Iraq War, which involved 36 million protesters peacefully marching in 3,000 protests across the world \[[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_the_Iraq_War)\]

Basically, I don't think it's true to say violent protests aren't a practical method. I'm not trying to open a discussion about the ethics or if the outcomes are always agreeable (it's perfectly fine to accept violence as a practical tactic, but not support it on ethical grounds).

CMV: A federal or statewide minimum wage is not the right solution to the problem,65,jdrmxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jdrmxe/cmv_a_federal_or_statewide_minimum_wage_is_not/,67,2020-10-19 08:24:57,"This post is about the United States, but any input of what works or doesn't in other countries is welcome.

First of all, I'm in favor of increasing the minimum wage. When minimum wage was first implemented it should have been tied to inflation or GDP to keep up. Not doing so was a major flaw and leads to a lot of the issues that making a big jump now would cause. This is what leads to a lot of arguments like how it would increase prices on everything and how it would be unfair to workers currently making moderately more than minimum wage. A gradually increasing wage would have resolved these problems, but this discussion should be reserved for a different post.

The point here is related to a federal or statewide minimum wage not being a good solution due to the vast difference in cost of living in different places. Passing a federal minimum wage that is sufficient for people living in LA is way too much for people living in rural Mississippi and would be impossible for small businesses to pay. Similarly, a statewide minimum wage that is sufficient for people living in NYC doesn't make sense basically anywhere else in the state.

I don't know the right solution to this problem, but the currently proposed minimum wage increases doesn't seem to be the right path. In theory, competition under capitalism should set appropriate wages at the minimum that somebody is willing to accept and be able to live on, but this would require basically 0% unemployment and has been shown to not work for hundreds of years. Besides that, the best thing for the economy is lower and middle class workers having disposable income (again a topic for a different post).",changemyview

CMV: women's birth control is more effective than men's birth control.,0,jdnylr,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jdnylr/cmv_womens_birth_control_is_more_effective_than/,22,2020-10-19 04:46:25,"Disclaimer: I'm not against the development of birth control and having more accessibility to contraceptives, however I've been seeing a great deal of bad arguments regarding this topic.

Lately, I've been seeing many people in social media arguing that birth control for men is more effective than for women. They typically present this argument. Men can impregnate a  woman every day, 9 times a day each year. That means that they can impregnate 3285 women a year. However each woman can only get pregnant every 9 months (actually they have to wait a bit after birth), even if they sleep with 9 men every day for those 9 months. Therefore, men's births control is more effective than women's.

Apart from the fact that this scenario is highly unrealistic and that this doesn't happen in reality, it suggests that men's birth control is more effective than women's. I've seen many friends retweet this but this arguments is completely wrong.

Let's use the same facts that these people present. Let's say we have 1000 men and 1000 women and that birth control is 100% effective. They're all healthy and fertile. First let's say we give all but one women birth control (so 999 women total). If now everyone has sex, only 1 woman can get pregnant. However if we give birth control to the same number of men (999) the one man that didn't get birth control can still impregnate all 1000 women.

This is why women's birth control is more effective, because it completely prevents the pregnancy. However men's birth control only prevents this man from impregnating a woman.

Edit: when I say ""effective"" I mean how much people can get pregnant (or how many can get prevent from getting pregnant) using each method at a group level.",changemyview
CMV: The only real reason someone would vote for anti-gay legislation is because of a deep seeded issue with their own sexuality or are uneducated.,0,jdndd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jdndd4/cmv_the_only_real_reason_someone_would_vote_for/,68,2020-10-19 04:13:36,"I have a list of reasons for holding this view. 

1. One of the reasons we are our own country was because those who created it were seeking freedom from religious oppression. Most people who try to explain their homophobic views typically go this route, ""it's against my religious views"" which makes no sense to me per the next reason. 

2. People can ignore others, it is super easy! Jesus wasn't even as judgemental as most devout religious people I have met. One of his closest followers was a prostitute named Mary Magdalene before she decided to repent. Also in this reason, we are not supposed to impose religious beliefs on others. Jesus didn't even do this, he mostly just preached and shared what he believed was the word of God, per se. 

3. Homosexuality is not communicable, so how does what anyone chooses for themselves affect other people at all unless they choose to be nosey?

4. There have been extensive studies done do show that this is not a choice but more so genetic, linked to the X chromosome. 

5. If you can't ignore homosexuality, I believe you have some issues being comfortable with your own sexuality because it has literally nothing to do with anyone but those who are homosexuals. Most people who try to impose will on others do so because of fear. I can't for the life of me see any reason someone would fear gays. 

6. There is a serious lack of education that is leading people to not understand many things, this is just one of those things. 

7. Even having been harassed sexually by another male at a young age, I have still not found myself okay with voting against someone's human rights to be a homosexual. This did not make me gay and while that person should not have done this and be punished, it doesn't speak for all gay people. That was one person and his choice to harass me. I know more gay people who would never try something without consent than I do straight people. 

8. Male Catholic priests sexually molest boys and then are given refuge in many cases by the same organizations. The hypocrisy behind this baffles me, those priests are supposed to be channels for God's voice right? I don't think so, when so many do horrible things like this. If the church was really so opposed to this, every molestation case would be made public and they would investigate much more frequently to make sure this isn't happening. 

9. Many children experiment with sexuality when they start to understand their sexual organs. This experimentation isn't homosexual in my view, it is an exploratory act from a human trying to find out what these parts do. So it seems that the fear of gays is something taught as opposed to being something one can be against at birth for many people. Not to say that all are born sexually ambiguous, but fear of sexuality is taught. Just because someone else is one way doesn't make everyone the same or mean that differences should be feared. 

10. People are unique and the inability to see this or even to limit this diversity of human beings just p

"CMV: Relatively useless fields of academia (philosophy, sociology, theology, etc.) artificially inflate their difficulty to give their field of study the facade of legitimacy.",0,jdn5or,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jdn5or/cmv_relatively_useless_fields_of_academia/,268,2020-10-19 04:01:48,"Edit: If you can name a couple things that field of Philosophy, Theology, or Sociology have done in the past 20 years or so that were instrumental to the advancement of humanity, I will change my mind.

\^This is the biggest thing that will change my mind on this subject. Please, someone, answer with this. Convincing me that ""every field is hard"" is not what I'm arguing. 

I'm going to list off some vocabulary and reserved words in the C++ language, and other fields of computer science:

\-Object

\-Pointer

\-Variable

\-Character

\-Binary

\-Algorithm

And now I'll list of some vocabulary terms taught in an introductory symbolic logic course:

\-Idempotence

\-Modus Ponens

\-Disjunctive Syllogism

\-Exportation and Importation

\-Truth-Functional Completeness

Some vocabulary taught in theology courses:

\-Concupiscence

\-Exegesis

\-Septuagint

\-Deuteronimical

\-Kerygma

Don't think I need to do sociology. It's essentially a 6 month course that won't stop talking about racism, and questions about whether gender is real or whatever those people are on about now. I think I actually heard them say ""Race is a social construct"", and ""Call latinos latinx because you don't want to assume their gender"" in SOC101 at my university. All I'm saying is, teenagers 90 years ago were fighting in WW2 after Pearl Harbor was bombed, trying to save the world from axis powers like Germany and Japan, and teenagers today are questioning whether they should say ""Latinx"" or ""latino/latina"" when they meet a Mexican person because they don't want to be offensive. Don't get me wrong, teenagers do great things today, this is only a minority of them that I'm referring to that seem to be wastes of skin. Fields of sociology spend hours in lecture showing stats about how blacks are sentenced longer than whites, and how that proves racism is real (causation vs correlation fallacy that is taught in Stats 101), or show statistics about how asians have little presence in corporate positions and use that to prove that corporations are racist against asians (again, they've presented no evidence to suggest racism, but they assume it anyways).

We obviously know which fields have done more for the advancement of humanity, I will concede that early philosophers have laid the foundation for mathematics, logic, and computer science, so I mainly refer to modern philosophy, especially as it exists in fields of academia. I will also concede that there are more complicated/intimidating vocabulary in fields of Computer Science, Engineering and Math that I have not listed here; I have tried to list what is generally taught in an intro level course at University. Fields of academia, like Philosophy (modern), theology, and sociology (academic sociology, like professors), inflate their level of difficulty by assigning complex and intimidating vocabulary to intuitive concepts in order to give themselves a feeling of legitimacy to comfort themselves, but ends up setting students up for failure as their classes become significantly more difficult because their professor wants to make themselves feel good about how they wasted their education to get a worthless degree. The one positive thing that I can say about this is that phil majors can no longer feel like they're spending their education to end up managing a McDonalds or whatever.

I know this is probably a controversial opinion, especially among academics and professors, but it's how I feel.

Change my mind.

Just thought I'd say this: I am not claiming that racism does not exist in America. I am saying that those sociology classes don't do a good job in providing evidence to suggest it is real. This isn't the subject of the post, though, so I won't respond to comments attempting to convince me that racism is the reason why blacks are sentenced longer or anything like that.

I understand if you personally disagree with the Bible, but I don't understand the problem with it in a democratic society.

First, like it or not, there is no way to not ""legislate morality.""  Nearly every law is enforcing your morality on others.  There are people who believe that segregation is morally acceptable, but the law disagrees.  I have seen more than one argument that parents should have the right to be able to ""abort"" their children, even after birth, yet most of us are fine enforcing our morality on those people.  And how much ink has been dedicated to the moral case for slavery in the 18th and 19th century?

And the Bible is a moral guide that many people follow.  According to Pew Research Center, 65%, about two in three, Americans are Christian.  So, if we are going to have a moral guide influencing the decisions of our democratic leaders, shouldn't it be one that a majority of the constituency follows as well?

Regardless or the demographics of their constituents, if a politicians runs, and wins, on being influenced by the morality of the Bible, and then they legislate based on that, isn't that entirely reasonable?  And even if you personally disagree with the Bible as a moral guide, the fact that it is a democratically chosen guide makes it a rational legislative guide.

Help me understand the other side of this argument, because I can't see how it's unreasonable to use the most commonly held view of morality to legislate.

PS. I focused the Christian Bible because that is by far the most common religious text in the United States, but this applies to any religious text.  if a politician is fairly elected, and that's what they believe, isn't that just democracy at work?",changemyview

Maybe that was supposed to be a joke, but I certainly hope George won't alter the plot of the books because his marriage is at stake. Would be a real shame if the plot was altered and the quality reduced so that George can please his wife, would be a huge loss of potential quality writing.   
EDIT: If you downvote because you disagree.... isn't the whole point of this sub to try to convince me of your point of view? Disagreeing is only the first part of the argument, and its also the part that's easiest to do and the part that has no substance... if you stop there, then it kinda makes the argument pretty weak doesn't it.... I don't mind the downvote, but if you can't provide a reasoning to your disagreement, you're essentially admitting that you can't argue and your opinion shouldn't matter as you have no reasoning to back up your opinion.

I'm not arguing that Barristan's post death was handled badly. I'm not arguing that Barristan's dead in the book. I'm not arguing that Barristan doesn't deserve a better death. I'm arguing that Barristan's death is fine in the context of GoT, and that is, not everything goes as planned and characters die left and right and are not immune. Any of you that read the old superhero comics will know that superheroes are pretty immune, they always fly with a smile and beat the shit out of any villains. This is also a prominent theme in mainstream media because the good guy always has to win. When I point out unexpected, it means different from my expectations. You all want to watch a movie where everything goes to your expectations? That's fine, your time, your money. For me, that's boring. If everything goes the way I expect it to go, why would I watch the movie? I already know the ending. Barristan dying in the alleyway and the manner in which he died is not what I expected, yet it goes perfectly with the fact that no GoT character, no matter how powerful they are, is safe. Aside from a few good points, I'm extremely disappointed in the majority of comments, which seem more directed to making fun of my grammar than making arguments.

Also I’m not here to rant, I’m here to at least either rationalize my position, or learn to understand someone else’s.

1: Everyone in this country is privileged. If you are sitting here bitching about how they think a president is racist when people in Syria are being bombed out of their homes, and gangs in my native country are brutally killing innocent people, and Muslims are being held in China and being fucking stripped of their beliefs. Now that shit is fucked up. I’m sick and tired of being out here hearing this bullshit from all you privileged people. 

2: These people don’t know what real racism is like. Yes there have been racist cops but imagine living in a country where the cops are corrupt as fuck and will watch you be beat and murdered by someone because they paid off the police. Even in Mexico racism exists, in many places you are treated better the whiter you are. Maybe it’s not as bad in the big cities, but in the countryside it’s ridiculous, light skinned Mexicans don’t have to lift a finger sometimes, because their town or family will bend over backwards for them. People in Africa have been getting targeted, and killed solely for being white. 

3: Police brutality is a whole different subject I’d be willing to go into, but I’ll just say many shootings of black people have been justified, the murders of Eric Garner and George Floyd absolutely weren’t justified, I can say that for certain off the top of my head, I’m sure there is more but I don’t have a list, but many, MANY of the shootings of black people were not justified. Everyone commits crime, black, white, red or yellow. 

4: The fact that so many people have been complaining about this shows your immense privilege, because you just simply don’t know what it’s like in other places. I implore you, if you are a person who believes America is this horrible place, do some research on other countries, recognize their struggle, these people need YOUR help. My people need YOUR help, because you come from the very country they would kill to live in.

"CMV:Provided the government in question is democratic, sayings like ""Socialism is when the government does stuff, and the more stuff the government does, the Socialister it is"" are unironically true and leftists who mockingly say things like this to clown on non-leftists are showing their ignorance",0,jdj1hs,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jdj1hs/cmvprovided_the_government_in_question_is/,21,2020-10-19 00:16:30,"**Background** Richard Wolff, a leftist professor has a semi-viral clip where he jokingly [talks about what socialism is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgiC8YfytDw) - the joke being that uninformed liberals, centrists and conservatives don't know what **real** socialism is. This has become a bit of an [in joke among leftists](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1682807-communism). 

**Why I think the statement is actually correct** On an orthodox understanding of what socialism is (the means of production being controlled socially), provided that the government in question is democratic, it seems to me that a government being big and doing stuff, like levying taxes to provide services, or regulating businesses to prevent them from doing things it doesn't want is a pretty clear case of there being collective social control over the means of production. Every time the government - which in a democracy, is just serving as an avatar of the people - makes a law about what businesses are and aren't allowed to do, or every time they take a tax, they are directly controlling what the means of production are doing, and where the wealth created with them goes. Ergo its socialist.

I don't really see a meaningful difference between a situation that is unambiguously socialist - such as the government creating a publicly owned firm (for example, in Scandinavia, their aluminum mills are all socialized) and normal government services like the post office or the TVA or something. If the distinction is just minutiae like the government owned enterprises have corporate officers, while normal government agencies just have appointed heads, that seems like a pretty weak distinction. To me, the forest service and bureau of land management are just REITS that the government owns, AMTRACK is just a public railway company, the usps is just socialized FedEx etc. If a government owned REIT is socialist, then so is the forest service.

I also don't really see a meaningful difference between on the one hand the public regulating and taxing a firm, whereby they get some of the wealth that the firm makes in taxes, and gets to control what the firm does through regulation, and on the other hand just owning a piece of the fund in a social wealth fund, where the public gets some of the wealth through dividends, and exerts some control over the firm's behavior through shareholder voting.

It seems like the main distinction is formal ownership, but legal ownership is actually a somewhat loose concept, that means different things in different countries, and time periods. My lawyer friend likes to tell me that property is a bundle of sticks - there isn't a precise legal definition for relationships like person A owns B house/factory/firm etc.

**Potential ways to change my view** - obviously not exhaustive, if there's a better argument, I'll do my best to consider it:

* There are in fact robust, ontological differences between things like GSEs, Sovereign wealth funds etc and the government just regulating and taxing firms and then using that to provide services.

* Sovereign wealth funds and GSEs/SOEs are not in fact socialist, so comparing them to taxes and regulations is beside the point. I've met some socialists who are convinced that something is only **really** socialist if the collectivization is at the firm, rather than state level (sometimes people will throw around the word state capitalism - but idk really what to do with that), but I've never really understood this line of reason; in my experience they get very hand-wavy and I lose interest, but I'm willing to entertain this line of reasoning if someone can explain and defend it clearly. I've also met some socialists who believe that the collectivized pieces of a mixed economy are not in fact socialist, that socialism is rather an all-or-nothing proposition. I think this is sort of dumb, as it would mean that as long as there's some granny in the mountains renting out her sewing machine for a profit, a country can never be truly socialist, no matter how collectivized everything else in the country is.

* Whether there's a robust ontological difference between sovereign wealth funds is beside the point for some other reason. The one ""you just gotta read more theory"" socialist I know in real life will say things that I don't really get about how socialism vs not socialism should really be decided by the method that it's brought about, as opposed to what it actually is - I don't really get what he's saying, and he's kinda out there on a lot of topics, but he's kind of smart, so maybe if someone can explain what this line of reasoning is all about, I'd change my view.

**Why I want this view changed:** I'm generally pretty anticapitalism-curious - I would probably call myself  a social democrat or something, but I get annoyed with how arrogant a lot of leftists are about reading theory and having Talmudic disputes about the finer points of leftist ontology. It's doubly annoying when someone is arrogant and wrong at the same time, which is what I think is happening when people say things along the lines of ""Socialism is when government does stuff..."" to mock people. I'd like to change this view because if I'm wrong about this, I can stop being doubly annoyed by people who I might otherwise learn from.

**TL;DR:** I do not believe that there is a robust difference between ""The government being big and doing stuff"" and unambiguously socialist things like GSEs and sovereign wealth funds, so it doesn't make sense to say that the latter is socialist but the former is not.",changemyview

When I was just entering grade school my art teacher was the nicest person but the only thing she would get mad at us for was having the brushes not soaking or washing them under the faucet first, and then only then did I wash my toothbrush before I brushed my teeth, the reason why is that I thought that it would ruin my toothbrush and I was a stupid kid and didn’t know how to ask my parents for another one. 

I just noticed it now that’s why I did it because my family was decorating pumpkins and I said wash your brushes and my brain pulled out the memory of that entire conversation, and the connection my 6 year old brain thought off.

CMV: Singing/rapping a song with the N-word in it doesn't give you the right to say it if you're not black.,0,jdibpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jdibpt/cmv_singingrapping_a_song_with_the_nword_in_it/,45,2020-10-18 23:35:26,"There's a huge debate over whether or not singing a song with the N-word in it makes saying the word acceptable.

I have a few problems with this.

1) It's easy enough to change. I'll admit I like listening to rap and singing along, and I ALWAYS change the N-word because I'm not black. It's not very difficult.

2) Obviously, everyone who does this or thinks it's okay KNOWS the impact of the word. They wouldn't ever dare utter it in any other context, so what makes this different? It feels like a flimsy reason to say the word and not get in trouble.

3) You would not give a white person a pass for WRITING a song with the N-word in it and saying, ""It's just a song!"" ""It's just a song"" is not a good excuse.

CMV: People worry way too much about climate change. It’s an issue that will work itself out.,0,jdgyvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jdgyvh/cmv_people_worry_way_too_much_about_climate/,75,2020-10-18 22:11:02,"Let me first flesh out my view on climate change. 

Global climate is a tough thing to measure over time. I hold the view that the earth, on a macro timeline (millions of years), has gone through periods of cooling and heating based on geological data.

I am skeptical about our ability to model future general trends (the global temperature anomaly will increase by 4 degrees) when we have massive troubles forecasting general weather a few months out.

This being said, the only reliable data we have is from the last 100-150 years or so. Everything beforehand, in my opinion, is largely unreliable and not helpful to making decisions today. 

Imagine global temperature anomaly behaving like a sinusoid with a period of 10,000 years. While it is possible we started collecting data during an increasing period on that sinusoid, and thus everything we are observing is inconsequential, this notion is not verifiable and we must make assertions based on verifiable data which says generally the following:

The global average temperature is increasing. There is a positive correlation between global atmospheric CO2 levels. The mechanism for the warming is radiative forcing caused by atmospheric greenhouse gasses (primarily CO2).

That’s what the data suggests. I don’t think anyone who has any real scientific understanding could argue that point. 

With all of this in mind, it seems that reducing atmospheric CO2 is the solution. So why aren’t we doing it? Easy, fossil fuels are way more abundant and therefore cheaper than any alternative energy source (generative). And we keep altering the environment in such a way as to handicap its ability to sequester atmospheric carbon because these resources are valuable to us (consumption). 

Solar panels are materials intensive and not efficient, wind energy has a NIMBY (not in my back yard) issue, all the dams have been built. Nuclear power (probably the best alternative) has inherent safety risks that need to be worked out. 

In my opinion, the issue here is: fossil fuels are cheap. Alternatives need investment into research to make them safer/cheaper. People are unwilling to do this because the return, currently, is just not there. 

As the situation worsens, if we allow free market capitalism to do its magic, there will come an inflection point where the stakes will become so high that investment in alternatives will produce a reliable return for investors. This will make alternative energy cheaper as the technology improves and becomes safer and more reliable. 

I imagine this point will come, unfortunately, after people start getting affected (mass costal displacements, heat waves, etc.) that’s just how it works. 

I like to site WW2 as an example. How, when presented with this global catastrophe, we were able to develop in the span of 4 years the most powerful nuclear technology that was unprecedented at the time. All it took was the proper motivation. 

I believe the same mechanism will solve climate change. But only after we start to feel real tangible pressure from it. Human ingenuity, when the stakes are high, will be kickstarted by Capital injection from investors who see they could get a return from investment in alternative energy. 

If you think we are not as capable and this free market capitalism view is flawed, feel free to change my view.",changemyview

This is a dangerous political tool that the elite can use to ensure votes on their behalf. I am extremely open minded to hearing others thoughts and opinions on this topic.

They are willing to rig an election, and have taken their president seriously when he suggests a third term. This is not democracy. This is fascism. He has repeatedly dog-wistled for racism, going as far to not even denounce the proud boys, and claims that the Confederate flag ""represents the south."" He even goes as far as to want to ""make America great again,"" and Hitler was obsessed with returning Germany to its former glory. This is the exact same thing. History repeats itself, and we're seeing it all again, with them claiming that Antifa are the ""real fascists,"" and even inventing Churchill quotes to back that up. To top it all off, this upcoming election will be close showing that not everyone sees this, and that scares me. So yes, Hitler is evil is now an unpopular opinion in this country.",changemyview

The pro-life stance is that a fetus is a living human with the right to live, and taking away that right is murder. How does the fact that a woman was raped suddenly change this? Yes, she was put through a horrible situation that should never happen, however this doesn’t suddenly remove the child’s right to life that a pro-life person claims they believe in.

CMV: Trophy hunting is unethical and should be internationally banned.,32,jdehsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jdehsd/cmv_trophy_hunting_is_unethical_and_should_be/,35,2020-10-18 19:05:21,"The hunting of animals for the main purpose of collecting trophies is a practice that causes massive amounts of damage to ecosystems, drives our most beautiful animals to extinction and is unethical not only on this basis, but on the fact that it is needless murder of a sentient being.

This applies particularly to African big game such as lions, giraffes, rhino (whoops too late), elephants etc but also to any animal hunted purely for sport.

A law that made each participating nation able to prosecute its citizens even if they went to a non-participating country to hunt would be the most effective way to deal with this.

Most of the hunters hunting big game are rich westerners, if they were able to be brought up on charges when they returned home with trophies or with pictures of them hunting lions etc splashed across their social media, it would give many a pause for thought. Outlawing ivory was a similar step but hasn't done enough.

For those who will suggest that hunting is a major economic factor in some places: the fact that it makes someone money is simply not a good enough reason to allow anything unethical. Plus, people who run hunting tours could switch to other forms of income like safaris etc and they would if the flow of hunters dried up.

For those who suggest it's a suitable conservation method: a) the most valuable (both in monetary value and prestige) big game hunted for sport are often endangered species.

B) you can control populations of other non endangered big game with means that don't glorify the killing of animals for sport.

I want to clarify that hunting for food and resources is something else entirely and I have no real issue with it if it's a necessity.

Is there any valid case for allowing trophy hunting that I am missing?",changemyview

CMV: Democracies should be striving towards a system where citizens can influence policy decisions by voting on important issues in real-time,7,jddqvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jddqvw/cmv_democracies_should_be_striving_towards_a/,29,2020-10-18 18:01:06,"In case my idea doesn’t come across clearly from the title, I’m talking about a technological solution (smartphone app for example) where members of society can provide their thoughts on political issues, and this data is used to influence government decision-making. Similar to the YouGov polling app, except more comprehensive and a lot more transparent around how the data is used to form key policy decisions in real-time. Essentially I’m advocating mini referendums for all manner of issues. And the technology should also be used to hold elections as well. 

I’ll talk in context of the U.K. as that’s where I’m from. I’ll admit straight away that I’m not fully aware of the mechanisms and internal workings of government, for example exactly how laws are drafted, reviewed, debated and passed into legislature. However, for me that doesn’t detract from or invalidate my idea... I just represent the common person in the street who is equally ignorant. 

My idea is essentially about modernising how democracy works. In the U.K. MPs (Members of Parliament) are elected to represent the interests of a certain geographical area. The MPs from different areas meet to shape and debate policy decisions, which are then voted on by parliament and by Lords (unelected officials). This may have worked brilliantly when the country’s population was lower and the elected officials were actually integral members of their local community... people who knew the hopes and dreams and fears and concerns of their electorate. People who knew exactly how the ordinary man was faring in day-to-day life and how they would benefit from government intervention. Nowadays though it would appear there’s more of a disconnect between voters and politicians, who it’s often commented “don’t live in the same world.” How can an MP claim to represent their constituents when they would probably struggle to name even fifty of them? In some cases MPs don’t even reside in the area they represent. In my area for example, I only ever hear from my MP when it’s local election time and they shove a letter through the door basically begging that I vote for them. I understand I can write to my MP about specific issues, and petition them via drop-in “clinics” which are held every now and then, but again this feels archaic and realistically, who has time for this now in today’s world?

So how would my idea work?

Well I think there should be a smartphone app, which every citizen has an account for. When important issues arise, every account should be notified and the user logs in to read impartial analysis on the topic, and then has one vote on the outcome they would like to see. I’m imagining radio buttons with different options spelled out, potentially with further child questions to further clarify their stance. The user then submits their vote on how the U.K. tackles this issue. After a fixed time period, results are published to the app and they should be binding... a democratic government should follow the wishes of it’s citizens. 

Elections would operate much the same way. Available parties/politicians would each have a biography and manifesto available in the app, with a handy little side-by-side comparison table for users to summarise and compare stances on important issues. The user then submits their vote via their phone. 

I’ll give a quick example that’s commonly reported on in the popular media; immigration. The app would start with a headline question, “should the U.K. provide residence and/or citizenship to any foreign nationals?” Depending on the answer given there’d then be a series of follow-up questions.... under what circumstances? Economic migrants? Refugees? How many? Should family units ever be broken up? What support should be given to set them up for life in the U.K.? Etc, etc. Like I say, each question would come with analysis and an explanation of the possible answers. 

I think this system would be vastly superior to the current political process, and would make it much easier for voters to engage in politics. It would give society assurance that their views are being considered, and their lives aren’t just being decisioned by a small group of individuals they can’t relate to and will never ever meet. As this is CMV though, I’m fully open to debate on this and welcome your counter-arguments. 

I’ll try and preempt some of the challenges I foresee... 

* the technology doesn’t exist; there are security concerns around data and anonymity, and it could easily be manipulated by nefarious individuals/organisations/foreign governments/etc. I know, my view is that we should be aiming for this, not that we should implement it today

* not everyone has a smartphone or is au fait with them. Well, not everyone bothers to engage in politics now anyway. And it wouldn’t really be all that expensive to roll out government-issued devices to those without, if we did want to make it accessible to all

* some people won’t take the time to understand the issues being debated, and won’t understand the implications of their vote. I totally agree with this one, but for me that’s the beauty of a democracy. Government should represent who society *actually* is, not some romanticised “better” (for want of a better word) version of who it’s citizens *”should”* be. Go back to the migrant example. If for example it turns out that a lot of people don’t want to bother understanding the issue and just say “yes to skilled workers we need in order to fill workforce gaps,” and “no to everyone else,” (you could make a strong argument this is very bigoted) then as unpalatable as that might be, sorry but that is what society actually wants, and as a democratic government it’s your job to represent the wishes of your people

* this all feels very “Black Mirror.” I see where you’re coming from, but I still think it would be progress and deliver a better outcome on the whole.

First off as it will be clear I'm American. Like I said he's been my favorite author for a while: Dan Simmons.

The book I'm referring to is Flashback. So politically I'm not looking for a debate or to have my mind changed, but the nature of this question has to dip into political territory. So I'll leave it at I lean pretty heavily liberal. Whereas the book idolizes ultra conservatives and ultra conservative values and demonizes liberal and socialist programs as the literal downfall of America's economy and America itself. These are not spoilers, these events have happened before the book begins.

Based on my political and social beliefs, I believe the message and propaganda of Flashpoint is literally dangerous. I think both the overt and more subversive ideas and beliefs the book puts forth, if put into real action would be damaging to this country. And I actually take it as a negative that, beyond the message, I really enjoyed the story and mystery and characters, as it means as propaganda for its message, it is that much more effective. Im not looking to debate this part. And conservatives you can flip it in your mind so the question is meaningful to you. A favorite author espousing the sort of liberal values you consider most wrong-headed and dangerous. 

And this is not about muting the other side or living in an echo chamber. I try to keep an open mindset and read viewpoints from both sides. But this book promotes a very clear political agenda, one that I'm not ignoring, but have taken my own educated stance on that is diametrically opposed to the views and beliefs the author both espouses and implies.

But, like I said he has been one of my favorite authors. Books like the hyperion/endymion series, ilium/olympos, the terror, summer of night... are literally some of the best books I've read in recent years and I would hate to think I'd never have read them if I read Flashpoint first. And maybe I'm blind, but I dont remember most of those books having obvious overt or subversive alt right messages. Maybe aspects i found problematic, like a certain Ilium character being kinda rapey. But nothing that struck me as obvious political propaganda. 

But, as the title states,  do i have a moral obligation to not support ANY of an author's work when he may use some of that profit to support causes and promote viewpoints to which I'm morally and politically opposed?

CMV: A wealth tax on the top 1% is unfeasible and would not benefit the economy.,0,jdauc3,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jdauc3/cmv_a_wealth_tax_on_the_top_1_is_unfeasible_and/,32,2020-10-18 13:42:11,"While the networth of the top 1% is staggeringly high, I believe that net worth is mostly just an illusion, and the top 1% would not have any ability to pay even a 5% wealth tax without being completely bankrupted, because that net worth is simply the sum of all assets at the current market price, that is a very bad estimate of one's spending power. 

For example, if they keep the money in the bank, the bank only keep enough cash in store to meet the current withdraw demands, a full withdraw of funds is impossible.

if they keep the money in stocks and bonds, they simply cannot sell all of them at the current market price, as each sale will lower the value of the security. An extreme example, if Elon musk holds 50% of tesla, and the TSLA is currently trading 1000 per share, at the news that Elon is looking to sell stock, the price of each share could quickly drop to 300 per share.  

if they value by holding non-public companies, you simply cannot sell it without a perspective buyer, and you can't withdraw 5% of the company's value in cash, because that would destroy the cash flow and put it into bankruptcy territory. 

A billionaire with a net worth of 1 billionaire would be lucky if he can get 10 million through the liquidation of his assets, especially when everyone has to sell to pay for a wealth tax. No one actually has that much money, it is just an illusion maintained because no one withdraws. 

If they just keep cash in house or in a oversea cash account, taxing that cash can definitely be feasible, but that cash is not circulating in the economy, so taxing it would be completely meaningless and would have no benefit. It would have the same effect as a monetary expansion from the central bank. By introducing now currency into the economy, it will only make every dollar in the economy worth a bit less. it will temporally increase the spending power as people are tricked by the less valuable currency, but that will only increase inflation in the medium to long term.

What billionaires does have are a sizable passive income, property purchased as extremely inflated prices, and the ownership of resources that is only valuable because others view it as such. You can tax that passive income, but a wealth tax will just be running toward a mirage.",changemyview

I see no problem with this; in fact, I welcome it. I have rarely seen characters in such heteroerotic situations explicitly refer to themselves as “straight” or “bisexual”, nor have I seen a particular demand for that and I see no reason why. Must a character that is involved in an erotic act with a superior also explicitly state that he finds power attractive or that he does not care so that the audience can be sure of that?

The argument in favor that is commonly raised is that it provides repræsentation for certain groups — yes, it provides repræsentation for those who engage in homoerotic acts and make of this an identity, but at the same time it takes it away from those that engage in homoeroetic acts and do not of this an identity.

In my opinion, I think that a society should be built on the idea that each person is worthless, but not in a disparaging way, but in a sense that allows each person to understand their own insignificance when compared to the collective. Rather than being taught that we are each important and special, we are taught that we are all equally as worthless, but our value comes in the form of many. I do not think that this would have to lead to an unhappier populace. I still believe that with this type of thinking everyone can still be unique and expressive in their own right.

Everyone who just spews hate will be blocked, since I have no intention on wasting my time with that. Leave people be in the replies, they can believe in whatever they like and just because you believe in something else doesn’t invalidate their beliefs. Now with that out of the way:

As I already said, I am agnostic, to be specific a non believer subtype (like a mixture of intellectual atheism & intellectual agnosticism), which basically means I don’t believe in God, because we don’t factually know if God really exists. However, I do not doubt that God could exist. My belief is the part of my view that most likely won’t change without a serious sign that God actually exists.

Now let’s get to the more debatable part of my view: I do not believe I will regret not believing in God. This is mainly due to the fact that I don’t believe there is a God and that when it’s my time to leave this earth I won’t have to face God in the afterlife. I don’t know what the other side, death, will look like, nobody knows, but I don’t believe I will enter heaven through pearly gates and face the creator of everything. There is a possibility that God exists, but I think my belief will  verify it’s thesis in the end. 

I also don’t think I‘ll regret not believing in God, because I‘m not a person to turn to anyone but myself and the randomness of events when bad things happen, nor do I believe that praying to someone we don’t really know is there and living a life without sin will bring me something good.

To further the view exchange I‘d like to ask a question: do you think that even if I didn’t believe in God my whole life, that I‘d be subject to Gods mercy regardless? I think theorizing about this exact question is interesting, because it can reflect so much regarding religion.

I don't want to say that fat hate is worse than racism, or sexism, or anything else.

With that disclaimer out of the way, it's disgusting to me how socially acceptable it is to judge fat people for their weight. I've seen people say that all fat people are morally weak, lazy, worthless, disgusting, even that they should be denied medical care on account of their weight.

I think the reason that this prejudice is so widespread and accepted is because we have this idea that weight is something people have total control over, and so it's okay to judge someone for being fat, because they must have chosen to be that way.

But statistically speaking, this makes zero sense. Obesity is a public health issue, not a matter of personal responsibility. Americans are not fatter than Chinese people because we have ""less responsibility"", we have actual systemic problems that contribute to obesity. The most accurate predictors of your weight are nearly all environmental; where you grew up, how rich/poor you were, the weight of your parents, your access to food, etc.

Moreover, whether it's a choice or not, the sheer disgust some people have toward fat people is unbelievable to me. It's always under the guise of wanting people to be ""healthy"", but I don't buy that for one minute.

Granted, that comes with a few caveats.

Namely, you must work hard in the time and place which offers the opportunity for growth. The expectation that working a sh*tty fast food job can bring you great success is unreasonable. You can work fourty years in such a job, and you will never see success.

The critical facet around the American dream is that you need to discover some way to provide great value to somebody or a group of persons, so that they are willing to give you their money for that value. That may mean working a skilled job, or that might mean starting your own business. If you truely provide real value to somebody, there's no way you won't see success.

Similarly, I feel part of the reason some people feel the American dream is dead is because they work a job with no significant opportunities outside the boundaries of their responsibilities in that position, or they simply think putting in the effort for growth is too hard or too complex and they'd rather suffer in their current situation than seek something better. Humans are inherently afraid of change. They'll tell you they want to find a way to grow, but actions speak louder than words. If they never put any effort to grow and get out of their situation aside from working their same job every day, they will never achieve that goal.

Historically, the American dream has involved working for the same company for your whole career and getting rewarded for your commitment. For most jobs, that has changed. People need to be less afraid of leaving their current company and seeking better opportunities, because if given the chance or the reason, the company will certainly leave you.",changemyview

I think that the overwhelming majority of men in civilised countries are dreadfully ignorant about the issues women face in today's world. They haven't given enough thought to the topic to recognize the massive amount of sexism that goes under the radar in society (such as men having to make the first move while dating, or women being forced to hide their sexuality), and so they assume a position similar to the following:

""I'm all for women's rights and equality, but feminists are just trying to take power from men and/or hate men, so I'm pro women but against feminism.""

In my opinion, the issue here is that most feminists are looking to comfort and empower women without ever bringing men in the dialogue, and when they do address men it's usually with a challenging tone. 

I think two things need to be done: the first is that the branch of feminism which antagonizes men should stop existing, as it drives away allies and just encourages hate; the second is that men should be showed the sides of sexism that directly affect them. It's A LOT easier to care about something that directly affects you.

Examples of such things would be the ones I listed above (men making the first move, slut shaming), but there are countless others, such as: feminine traits in men being choked away, which can lead to homophobia as well; the majority of hobbies being male-dominated; a huge amount of men not being able to find relationships and sex and more.

It's not us vs them, men vs women and more people of both genders need to recognize it.

I would like to make it clear that I'm not saying women shouldn't be empowered. They should, as otherwise it's all just fucking depressing and hopeless. However that's a temporary solution, long-term change has to come from men, as unfortunately that's where almost all of the power is.

I'm also from Europe, so this discussion might be different in other countries. Definitely in Asia, but I could see it being different in America as the country leans more to the right there, so the issues might be less subtle.

CMV: Student Loan Forgiveness is a bad policy,0,jcwh6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jcwh6r/cmv_student_loan_forgiveness_is_a_bad_policy/,133,2020-10-17 22:52:16,"The idea of forgiving all, or even a majority of student loans is personally vexing. I don't think that the government, and by proxy the taxpayers, should extend blanket repayment of the debt of students. This is for a few reasons.

&#x200B;

1. **There are a multitude of affordable universities that do not require a significant amount of debt to attend**. For example, the cost per term for the University of Memphis is approximately 5,000 dollars. This is affordable for most people who work a full time job, and if not, results is approximately 40,000 in loans on total for a four year degree. This is a reasonable amount to pay for college (about the same as a new Hyundai), and easily repaid in a few years even with interest. There are also a variety of pell grants, state grants, scholarships, and other options for financial aid. This is also not accounting for the high level of affordability that can be found at community colleges nationwide.
2. **Going to college is not required in order to be successful, and is a personal choice**. There have been many millionaires and billionaires who have created vast amounts of wealth without attending a four year university. Additionally, there are a multitude of trade schools, as well as apprenticeship programs available to graduating high school seniors. For example my brother, with only a high school education, got a job at a car dealership changing oil. He moved up to an hourly, then commission, technician. After a few years he became the manager of a racing auto shop, and now makes greater than six figures (with no formal education). Another family member attended a trade college, and trained as a welder. He can now make more than 30 dollars an hour as an entry level welder. The idea that all people need to go to college in order to become successful is a lie that has been perpetrated by for-profit (public and private) academic institutions, and has devalued those who have pursued higher education, resulting in an overemphasis on the pursuit of graduate education, which further devalues undergraduate degrees.
3. **There are already multiple free (Nothing is ever truly free) college tuition programs.** You can join the military, and earn the GI bill (as well as a skillset in many cases), which pays the overwhelming majority of all college fees as well as a stipend for room and board. Alternately, during your time in the military, you can apply for tuition assistance and receive money from the military for tuition while you are active duty. Additionally, there is the ROTC and service academy programs, which pays for your college degree, and requires a payback as a paid officer in the military. Obviously these come with a large amount of physical, mental, and emotional sacrifice. Fortunately there are other, less physically demanding and dangerous options. Americorps and Teach for America are fantastic opportunities to have a chance to pay into the community as a teacher in underprivileged schools and also graduate with little or no student debt (or to have that debt forgiven). Lastly, there are a variety of scholarship and grant programs which provide opportunity to those of low income, and those who are high performers. My bottom line here is that no one gets a free lunch, nor should they.
4. **Poor decision making, regardless of age (assuming the person is an adult) or the outside pressures felt, should not become a burden upon others.** Many people who have gone to university have experienced someone who has squandered their student loans on new airpods, beer, clothing, eating out, or other personal luxuries. Additionally, the choice to pursue a degree in a field like 18th century Russian literature, although beautiful and noble, is fundamentally a personal decision and should not affect the tax burden of other citizens. Pursuit of a field which has a variety of open positions, and lucrative financial opportunities after graduation, should be the goal, not a side benefit. The pervasive idea that one should pursue a career that makes them feel good, rather than makes them successful, (I personally believe) is toxic to the success of society. I reject the idea that the taxpayer should bear the burden of a student deciding to study something fun or something they find interesting rather than something they can make a living in. Actions have consequences (in this case debt), and no one should be subject to consequences for actions of another.
5. **The idea of forgiving student debt removes responsibility from the students themselves, and is potentially teaching them that their actions don't have consequences.** I think that regardless of your personal views on education or the pressure to pursue it (whether social, financial, or familial), most people will agree that actions have consequences, and that it is beneficial for people to bear the consequences of their own actions. It is useful in the learning process, and helps people to make better choices in the future, and removes agency to clear that level of responsibility for one's actions.
6. **The government (a slow, wasteful, and ineffective entity)  should not be the source of goods, services, or welfare for the people.** As such, the government should not be in the business of giving things like college education to the citizenry. Everything comes from somewhere, and in the case of the government, it comes from the people ultimately. I recognize this is largely a philosophical view, or at the very least a personal view on the role of government, and that not all people will agree with it. As such, I would consider it to be one of my weakest arguments, but I would feel remiss. not including it as I think it also shapes my opinion.

Things that will not convince me are appeals to the idea that we NEED to educate everyone via the university system. Additionally, arguments that ""all universities are not the same"" and that ""in order to be successful, one must go to an expensive college"" will not convince me. Arguments that, ""That is what Sweden does, and they are successful"" are unlikely to persuade me due to the vast differences in both size, and distributions of the population. Furthermore, I am not arguing that we do not require some reform of the public university system, as well as the public high school education system. I think there is too much emphasis on 4 year education, and i think that the commercialization of higher education is a leading cause of this. I think that it is a travesty that public institutions are treated like ""for-Profit"" businesses, and that is one of multiple factors that have driven the rising cost of 4 year education (two others being greedy and ineffective administrators, and government subsidies).  I do accept that there are some limited cases in which there was deliberate fraud or misleading with regard to the educational entity, and I think that this should be an exception to my position. 

Bottom line is that I feel no need to pay for (with my tax dollars) the unnecessary, frivolous, and often ill advised educations of people who often times pursue degrees that have low (if any) prospects in the job force, whilst there are viable affordable (and even free options) that exist. I welcome anyone to change my view.",changemyview
cmv: President Obama is not criticized enough for his failures on hostages,37,jcwani,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jcwani/cmv_president_obama_is_not_criticized_enough_for/,36,2020-10-17 22:41:54," During the Vice Presidential debate, Mike Pence criticized Obama and Vice President Biden for failing to act on intelligence that would save Syrian hostages.   How this did not become another Benghazi level talking point is beyond me.   

Around a week later, after the hype of the debate wore off, The Washington Post published an article claiming to fact check Pence’s claim about the hostage situation. It attempts to disconnect Obama’s involvement with the planning of the mission, and resorts to saying that he signed off on the plan right when he was presented with it in the Situation Room.   


https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/10/12/pences-jab-that-obama-hesitated-month-rescue-kayla-mueller/?outputType=amp  

Here’s where the article falls flat:  

A couple of times throughout the piece, the fact checker brings up that many people in the Obama administration felt that that initial intel was not sufficient enough to launch a rescue mission.

   “Some people in the U.S. government thought the intelligence was not solid enough. But it (A Daily Beast Article mentioned in the fact check) does not lay the blame on Obama.”

  “there was an interest in making sure the intelligence was confirmed before launching a rescue mission. It (an abc article) mentions “the White House,” which could be any number of people beneath the president.”  

These claims sound good, and I initially believed it as well, however, with a couple of seconds of thought, this doesn’t really make any sense.   

Here’s why:  

The President is the one that authorizes these rescue missions, so when articles say “The White House did not give the green light”, that would mean the president. The National Security Council does not have the authority to approve rescues, so Obama had to share the thought that the intel wasn’t good enough. I could not find any evidence anywhere (If you find any, link it) that anyone that works in the White House’s job is too asses the quality of intelligence before presenting it to the president.   

“But if Obama didn’t give the green light, how did he sign off right away? This must mean that it was others in the White House that delayed presenting the plan to the president before they believed it had sufficient enough intel, right?”  

Wrong. My theory is that they are dancing around the fact that Obama didn’t sign off immediately. When officials say he signed off immediately, they are most likely meaning that he signed off on the plan SECOND time that he was asked to, quickly. The plan that was originally presented was not considered to be a complete plan by the White House, so they can use the excuse that he signed off on the plan immediately, if they characterize it that way.  

I may be performing some mental gymnastics here, as I always try to assume the worst possible way that a situation happened. However, in this case, I’m not entirely convinced of the WaPo’s claims here.

"CMV: God (or ""luck"") controls the world",0,jcvy43,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jcvy43/cmv_god_or_luck_controls_the_world/,33,2020-10-17 22:21:42,"**Edit:**

I gained an important insight while replying to  /u/but_why1417.

  
**For me ""controlling"" something is synonymous with ""getting results"". If you don't get results by doing something it means that you don't have control.** 

If you ""get results"" AKA some kind of reward when you didn't put effort then it means you didn't have control over it.

**That's what this whole God argument boils down to!  I feel we can target this belief as well ""controlling something means getting the results whenever you want"".**

\----------------------------------------------

**Original Post:**

What do I mean?

* God or ""luck"". Whatever you want to call it.
* I mean that it's a waste to put effort into anything. In the end all your effort could get wasted because you won't get the results. Or, you could get rewarded even without putting any effort. It's all just luck and God's work.
* God has total control over everything in the world (reasons explained below). And I mean *absolute* control.
* God gives control to some people (so the whole world can feel that ""humanity is in control""). So you would see a few people (like Trump / Hitler Corporate Top men) who're filthy rich and actually affect many people's lives in various ways. But for the rest of humanity, we have very very little control (like maybe 1% control over our lives).

Reasons:

* We say that ""God controls everything in the world"" and ""not even a leaf moves without his will"". It follows from this that if anything bad happens then it happened because he willed it.
* There is an uneven distribution of wealth, power, empathy, helpfulness in the world. There are horrible people who're filthy rich, thugs with a lot of power who're ruining life for everyone, and helpful/empathizing people who're extremely poor. Who's caused this? It's all God's fault because he's the one who controls who gets born where.
* There are way too many things outside our control that are controlled by God and lay waste to our efforts:
   * A chance encounter of a racist who might meet your boss and convince him that you're not up to the mark which causes you to lose your job.
   * Your car suddenly breaks down in the middle of the road right at a very critical point in your life when you had to reach somewhere quickly.
   * An incompetent colleague who uses wrong grammar which hides the details of his real stupidity and blunders which resulted in client escalations. His stupidity being masked by borderline statements which can be misinterpreted to his advantage thereby, leading to him being promoted. Incidents like this are clear proof that God controls the world completely through his minor ways.
   * You make plans to learn some topic for your career and suddenly something else comes up that becomes a huge thing. Now you need to learn that thing or slowly become obsolete. All your effort goes wasted.
* Small things can suddenly make big impacts (in both positive and negative ways):
   * For example, I spent years perfecting my skill at a job. And then got fired by a person who was racist against me (but politically correct). I don't have control over this. All the years of effort that I spent mastering my work, the praise from my colleagues, the ""best performer"" award was a waste of time. In the end the one who survived was the most incompetent person in the team + he got promoted to a lead.
   * You do excellent work in a very technical field. But everyone around  you (including your boss) is incompetent enough to realize the technical aspects, the problems, what you solved and how you solved. You do your best to train everyone about the technical aspects and the solutions that you're implementing and yet they're stuck on understanding basic questions.
* We're surrounded by idiots in the top positions everywhere - be it corporate, politics, institutions, ministries. Many of these were just born into their positions. How did they get there? Because God put them in power by letting them be born in powerful families.
* You don't get to choose your problems (like Social phobia for example). You're born in families / situations happen around you that load lots of problems/responsibilities/inconveniences onto you. You could be nearing 40 years of age and yet still struggling with taking care of people / all the responsibilities that God threw onto you. So he controls the world.
* You could put tremendous effort in something for years and still not get any results out of it for no reasons except ""luck"".
   * As an example, I created a website on Python courses (and spent 3 years of effort on it). I showed it to various people on reddit who liked the course and said it's way better than most courses out there. But I could never get advertising to work for it. Google ads f\*\*ked my business with some error or the other for the last 6 months. So I don't really have control over things. He's the one who controls my luck and everyone else's.

I believe that God (or luck) controls everything in the world. We don't really have any control over it. Contradict absolutely anything you can on this page. Please help me CMV!",changemyview

___

Often when someone posts online saying that they're considering suicide, there are comments from others saying things like this:

""Don't do it! ...""

* ""...You don't know me, but I love you.""
* ""...I would be sad if you were gone."" 
* ""...You will be missed./There are people who love you."" 
* ""...It will get better.""

I'm not against trying to help people in general – for example, providing people with [good resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines), offering to genuinely talk/listen to them, giving them some advice or perspective from your own life.

But responses like those I've listed are...

* insincere: No one deeply loves a random internet stranger or is devastated by news about a stranger's death (which they probably won't even follow up on after they click out of the thread). At most, they might be kind of sad for like... 15 minutes?

* hollow: Easy to post, ""without real significance or value""

* possibly harmful: If someone is truly alone, which happens, saying ""you are loved"" etc. could be twisting the knife

#Unlikely to change my view:

* ""I really do universally love all people."" – Okay, but what's the point in telling a suicidal person that? ""Don't die, I love all people, including you."" So?

* ""Someone said this to me once, and it was really meaningful."" This is anecdotal, and also, my view is mostly about the sincerity of the comment, not the occasional positive effect it may have.

#May change my view:

* Fundamentally changing my perspective on these comments somehow

* Convince me that most people who make these comments are truly, deeply, personally invested in this stranger's survival

* Provide some non-anecdotal evidence that these types of comments are more likely to save someone's life than the other types of engagement I mentioned

EDIT:

I have awarded some deltas.

* /u/Blowflygirl's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jcvibk/cmv_telling_suicidal_strangers_on_the_internet/g93wk1m/) changed my view somewhat. I still think these replies are often low-effort and hyperbolic, and that there are much more sincere and effective ways to engage. But Blowflygirl pointed out that it's probably better than no response, which I'm inclined to believe. I've come to see it as a badly-worded ""I hear you <3,"" and that can be valuable.

* /u/petrichoring is an actual crisis counselor and [agrees](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jcvibk/cmv_telling_suicidal_strangers_on_the_internet/g946vau/) that these comments can have some value. They have a good perspective, and it's more knowledgeable than mine.

* A lot of replies seem to be saying, ""Yes, these commenters aren't heavily invested, but they're still allowed to define what 'love' means for them,"" which I didn't find very convincing. (You can say a hot dog is a burrito, but...). And, as I said in my OP, I hadn't thought that valuing all human life was the same as genuinely loving every individual person. But /u/QueenMackeral's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jcvibk/cmv_telling_suicidal_strangers_on_the_internet/g94jwlq/) prompted me to rethink how profound that empathy can be.

It used to be a great tool to answer unsolvable mysteries and guide people who had no idea what the fuck life was about.

However, it has also ALWAYS been about controlling the masses and brainwashing. These poor people constantly living in fear of chastisement by some infinitely powerful being. You better act nice now, or (insert your divinity here) will fuck you up for eternity!

Oh what's that? You guys believe in a different god than us? Looks like it's time for a god damn blood bath! But sure, religions are about peace and kindness, unless you don't believe in the right one.

Also I already see you guys coming with the ""oh but don't put all the apples in the same basket, there's some bad religious people, but there are some good ones too!!"" 

Fuck that bro. The actions of those bad apples far outweigh the positive aspects of the good ones. Yes some religious people contribute to charity and stuff, but do you really need religion for that? Can't you just be a good person without it?

Also, how is no one calling them cults? It's the same fucking thing. If some nutjob claims to be the son of a god today, everyone laughs at him and calls him crazy, cause he is, but sometimes he gets a following and we're all like ""well clearly this is a cult. These people are fucking stupid to believe that this guy is any kind of divinity whatsoever"". How many of the ones who laugh at cults are actually religious? I'd bet it's a fuckton of'em, but sure, fuck introspection and let's all be hypocrites.

My final point now, some of you may argue that religion is also about spirituality and trying to better yourself as a person, it's a moral compass. Again, fuck that shit! You don't need a fucking cult leader who's been dead for thousands of years to tell you how to act. We have social norms and things that are acceptable and things that aren't. Just be a fucking adult and reflect on your actions and thoughts and better yourself that way. Most religious people, as I said earlier, only follow that ""moral compass"" to escape an imminent doom when they die, not to actually be good people. They do it out of fear, and I don't think that makes you a good person, that makes you a coward who's scared of something nonexistent.

Religion should and needs to be abolished, but of course that'll never happen. Oh well.

Tl/Dr : Religions are about controlling people, have been and always will be a source of violence and hatred. They are cults and need to be abolished.

Edit: Just to clarify, I do not wish any harm or hatred towards any religious people and I am for letting people belive what they want to, live and let live. However I just think religion shouldn't be a part of our society ANYMORE. I am against religion as a CONCEPT in a MODERN society. Not against religious PEOPLE. I know religion was a pillar of humanity IN THE PAST. I do not think it is still required TODAY.

Thank you for your time everyone, there are some insghtful comments that made me reflect and I did soften my view on the subject. ""Abolishing"" religion was a poor choice of words, it should just die out slowly while only keeping the positive morals of it, through education. However, my view is not changed.

I've noticed when it comes to this, the idea is often split among the masses,and to me, they are both looking at it the wrong way and yes,  I understand they believe through their life experience and perspectives.

The trick here is to look at the saying, ""people can change"". What's intresting is that this is a saying that to understand it's meaning, you look at it literally. People can change, it doesn't say will or won't change.

Another point to support my idea is the fact that everyone has varying levels of self-awareness and the ability to self-improve. On top of of that, if people leave them or treat then different and they notice, the typical reaction is either to blame themselves or just blame everything else. That all gives the idea that it is possible for that person to react accordingly, but you never really know for sure until it happens.

So in the end, it's silly to think someone will change on their own. Likewise, it's also silly to believe that someone won't change.",changemyview
CMV: People are Trans because of societal pressures/stereotypes and it's okay to look for conversion therapy to become cis-gendered,0,jcurnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jcurnx/cmv_people_are_trans_because_of_societal/,51,2020-10-17 21:04:38,"Just a note, I've recently finished university and have a few trans and non-binary friends (I even asked one out... and got rejected :') and have 0 issue with a person being trans. I went to most of the LGBTQ events in my uni and loved em. Not that these in themselves means I'm not transphobic but I figure might help put across this is more about learning about the core of being Transgender.

The only inherent different differences between men and women is the physical bits they come with and I'm fairly sure that people with gender dysphoria and trans people don't just want to switch their bits to become the other. People who literally just want tits and a vagina over a penis or vice versa I have no misunderstanding with and I think that's fine but I don't know of anyone whomst has this perspective. I think the much more common perspective is one that your inner you doesn't reflect the sex you were born with, you feel like a women/man when you were born the opposite. So logically if the only inherent difference between men and women is physical and there is no ""feeling"" inherent to the genders how can you have the wrong gendered ""feelings"".

I would say that it's based on society and cultural pressures that are based on gender eg the types of toys boys and girls are supposed to like or how men and women are treated/expected to be in religion or cultures. I can see how these differences that society and culture makes you think are attached to a gender would make it possible to say ""Hey, I dont like boy toys, I like girls toys therefore I am a girl."" If this is the case I'd say a much more preferential option to changing gender or even surgery is counselling to separate these notions that you are defined by your label.

I think being a close topic to sexuality, the concept of conversion therapy is likely to sting and most certainly shouldn't be called conversion therapy but I think something of the sort should be practised. For sexuality it isn't a good idea because sexuality is this base urge that isn't worth changing because there's nothing wrong with whatever sexuality you are however transitioning and being transgendered is changing who you are because of societal pressures. It's almost like the conversion therapy for homosexuality is the surgery and transitioning for Trans people. Surely learning to accept who you are, physical parts and born with gender. Again assuming the reason for this lack of acceptance is societal and cultural pressures and not biological or inherent to certain brains?

Perhaps transitioning is for some people the best and easiest way to get around these cultural and societal pressures but from what I've heard it seems like there is no benefit in suicide rates or mental health from transitioning. Anyone with knowledge on studies or anything like that to do with this is open to changing my mind.

I can't think about another way to think about this topic so perhaps I'm just stating the obvious but I'm excited to see if anyone has alternative perspectives.

Edit: Apologies Just been walking the dogs, I'll get to responses now!

Edit 2: The reason I used the term conversion therapy is because... well I guess I wanted to attract attention and thought the term was synonymous for regular therapy for these cases. My opinion is simply I think the treatment for gender dysphoria is too focused on transitioning and accepting one's born gender should be more explored but I most certainly don't want anything analogous to the gay conversion therapy psychotic stuff.

Edit 3:  My logic here is, unlike being gay or straight, there isn't a significant difference to being a man or women. Being gay or straight means having your brain be sexually or romantically attraction towards a specific gender, being a women is having tits and a vagina, being a man is having a slong. There are definitely some hormonal and brain structural differences but these are things that only show in average psychologies of men and women eg Men are more aggressive. These average psychologies become gendered roles and stereotypes and then people start feeling gender dysphoric when they don't fit their gender.

Edit 4: A commenter gave me a well sourced document that transitioning does help the mental state of those who do transition so I was clearly wrong about it not benefitting folks! Sorry!  


Edit 5: Okay not that their aren't differences between men and women but that no individual can know how it feels to be another person therefore logically from that you cannot know how the opposite gender feels and if you fit that gender. Hell you can't even know if you fit your own gender the only thing you have to go off is the average psychologies of people which become these gender roles and stereotypes.",changemyview
CMV: Pre-Op Trandgender people are not the gender they identify as any more than the gender they were born as.,1,jcu44i,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jcu44i/cmv_preop_trandgender_people_are_not_the_gender/,51,2020-10-17 20:16:16,"This is a slightly different variation of the position, “trans women are not women”. I understand that gender identity is a biological thing that is real, but I don’t understand why having a female gender identity automatically makes you female.

This is mostly about semantics, specifically about how words mean certain things. Words gain meanings by repeated use, and the words “man” and “woman” have been used to refer to people who were born with with male or female bodies for a long time, and so, they are legitimate definitions of those words. Also, it mostly concerns pre-op transgender people, as post-op transgender people have bodies that match their gender identity enough that discussing them would be a separate question.

Trans activists have argued that people identify as male or female (or something else but that is outside this question), and this should be the basis of how we define “male” and “female”.

While I agree that this is a legitimate way of using “male” and “female”, I disagree that this is the only way of defining them. I think that definition by body at birth, due to its history, is also a legitimate way of using man and woman and should still be allowed.

You could argue that transgender people suffer mental pain when referred to as a gender that does not match their gender identity, but I would argue that doesn’t change how legitimate definition by body is, only that you should not talk about it in the presence of transgender people.

In a nutshell, my position is that judging if someone is a man or a woman by what they were born as is as valid as judging by their gender identity, because they are different definitions of the same words, and neither of them is more valid than the other.

I think this is wrong somehow, but I would like to understand why.

This post was edited.

EDIT

I think I understand now, we have words to refer to people with certain gender identities because it is an intrinsic part of their minds, and it changes how they interact with the world.

We don't need words to refer to people with certain genitals or bodies, so we do not have them. And we were already refering to people's gender identities before knowledge of Trans people became commonplace, so we would be doing what we were already doing, so there is no contradiction.

As [I have mentioned](https://np.reddit.com/r/AustralianPolitics/comments/i6vq5p/political_hot_takes/g11s9nx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) on r/AustralianPolitics, arts doesn't build our infrastructure, produce essential goods for us, or help us develop technologies to solve our problems. If Australia's artists can't survive without government patronage, that's their problem, not the government's. Someone on that sub told me that arts was good for maintaining our democracy, but to be honest, I don't see how that is the case, because countries like PRC are single-party states despite having a very strong arts sector. 

Anyway, back to the cuts to the arts sector. Scientists like Dr Karl Kruszelnicki [are complaining of Australia's pretentious and obscenely low investment in the space sector](https://twitter.com/DoctorKarl/status/1313798131390140419). I searched up the [Australian Space Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Space_Agency), and it has a budget of [$41 million over 4 years](https://www.zdnet.com/article/budget-2018-government-confirms-au41m-space-agency/). Imagine what it could do with $254 million.

But more importantly, I believe in letting moribund industries hang out to dry. Australian industries need to be smart, not subsidy-dependent. We have already seen [the consequences of being un-innovative and subsidy-dependent on our automotive industry](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-19/holden-doomed-once-the-subsidies-stopped/11977482). New Zealand, with quarter our population, [manages to spend less than $10 million of taxpayer funds annually on its space industry, and gets a $1.69 billion space industry in return](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/117413667/nz-space-economy-reaches-take-off-totaling-169-billion). My point is, we need to be smart with our spending in all sectors, and the taxpayer funding cut out of the arts sector could have funded far better endeavours if we chose said endeavours wisely, and used the funds to boost innovation instead of complacency in industries.",changemyview

CMV: Big companies aren't evil for trying to make money and maximize profits,14,jcdxa4,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jcdxa4/cmv_big_companies_arent_evil_for_trying_to_make/,92,2020-10-17 01:14:49,"Almost every comment on some controversial business news posts talks down a company for making moves to make more money. Many people portray them as scum bags, evil, and huge antagonists in their personal life for some business decisions that they personally don't agree with.

What else does a for-profit business do? They don’t exist to grant your wishes, to give to the poor, or to make the world a better place. Occasionally they do those things, but their number one priority is to make money, because that’s ultimately what keeps them alive and makes them grow. Anyone who thinks otherwise is selfish and ignorant, because they want the company's actions to bend to their will.

The most recent case on my mind (although there are various ones) is the move by Apple to remove the power adapter and headphones included in the box with the purchase of a new iPhone. They say it will help reduce E-waste and decrease their carbon output. Do I believe them? *Absolutely.* Could it also be a move about saving money? **Of course.** Those two aren’t mutually exclusive.

I know I’m going to be called an Apple Sheep for saying that they’re not evil for doing this, but I would have my same opinion if any tech giant were to pull a move similar to this, be it a direct competitor or a business in an entirely different industry.

Obviously if a company does immoral or illegal things, then that’s a different story. But I'm talking specifically about **legal** moves that maximize profits that a company could make, whether it be removing free accessories, making proprietary software/hardware, increasing prices, etc. When a company has a true monopoly in a certain area or industry, then that crosses into illegal/immoral. For example, if Internet Company X is the only available one in the area and they keep shady business practices, poor support, and outrageous prices, that is obviously an immoral move since their customers truly have nowhere else to turn for an arguably essential service.

If the company made a bad decision, people will stop giving them money, and they'll need to revert/change their business model in order to stay alive. As it should be. If they can find ways to make/save more money and stay profitable because their product has value to consumers, then that is perfectly fine.

As much as I believe this, I'm truly open to change my view if someone can coherently explain why a company is bad or even acting immorally for trying to maximize profits.",changemyview
"CMV: If employers expect a two week notice when employees quit, they should give the same courtesy in return when firing someone.",23172,jcdlzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jcdlzh/cmv_if_employers_expect_a_two_week_notice_when/,1529,2020-10-17 00:58:38,"I’ll start off by saying I don’t mean this for major situations where someone needs to be let go right away. If someone is stealing, obviously you don’t need to give them a two week notice. 
 
So to my point. 

They always say how it’s the “professional” thing to do and you “don’t want to burn bridges” when leaving a job. They say you should give the two week notice and leave on good terms. Or that you should be as honest with your employers and give as much heads up as possible, so they can properly prepare for your replacement. I know people who’s employers have even asked for more than the two weeks so that they can train someone new. 

While I don’t disagree with many of this, and do think it is the professional thing to do, I think there is some hypocrisy with this. 

1) Your employers needs time to prepare for your departure. But if they want to let you go they can fire you on the spot, leaving you scrambling for a job. 

2) The employer can ask you to stay a bit longer if possible to train someone, but you don’t really get the chance to ask for a courtesy two weeks. 

3) It puts the importance of a company over the employee. It’s saying that employee should be held to a higher standard than an employer. As an employee you should be looking out for the better of this company, and be a “team player”. 

Sometimes there are situations where giving a two week notice isn’t needed. If you have a terrible employer who you don’t think treats you fairly, why do you need the two week notice? If you feel unappreciated and disrespected, why is it rude to not give a notice? 

If that’s the case then why do people not say the same about employers firing people with no notice? How come that’s not rude and unprofessional? Why is that seen as a business move, but giving no notice of quitting is seen as unprofessional? 

If we’re holding employees to a standard, we should hold companies to the same standards. 


EDIT: Thank you for all the responses, I didn't think this would get this large. Clearly, I can't respond to 800 plus comments. I understand everyone's comments regarding safety and that's a valid point. Just to be clear I am not in favor of terminating an employee that you think will cause harm, and giving them two weeks to continue working. I think a severance is fair, as others have mentioned it is how it is in their country. However I agree with the safety issue and why you wouldn't give the notice. I was more so arguing that if you expect a notice, you need to give something similar in return.",changemyview
CMV: Marital laws are currently discriminatory and need either an over haul or get abolished. (Canada),0,jcawvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jcawvw/cmv_marital_laws_are_currently_discriminatory_and/,48,2020-10-16 22:35:10,"I don't know how to put this, but almost everything about the article about our 'civil marriage act' seems ridiculous to me. 

[https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-31.5/page-1.html](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-31.5/page-1.html)

First let me preface with my view on laws. I believe laws should be about preventing one person from harming ANOTHER. Key word. Granted, there are other issues that are grey, but that's the general view of mine. I also believe that, based on this, laws should be as inclusive as possible while working towards giving people food, water, shelter, and medical care. Anything else is a luxury. Now, how much shelter is 'enough' is fluid, but that's the idea. 

Now, I'm no lawyer, so I can't read the whole thing and understand it, but here's my lay view of it:

When two people are married, they are allowed to share insurance. Now, what if I want to share my insurance with someone who is not my spouse, because I am single? Now, people can say, if you want to share your insurance with someone, just marry them. Well, I can't marry my widowed (hypothetically) mother, for example. I can't marry my brother or sister. 

I guess the main issue for me is that to me laws should be inclusive as possible. Way back, when straight people could get married, so then, should homosexuals. In fact, I do think relatives should get married if they are all consenting adults. If I have 2000 dollars in insurance money, why shouldn't I be allowed to allocate it to anyone I wish?

Secondly, divorce: People talk about pre nups, but I fail to see why, if I have 1 million before marriage that I am required to share. Yes, I understand going into it I know I will have to do that, which is why I don't want to get married. But the question is why the rule /law or whatever it's called, still exists. 

Also, marriage visa: why should married people be allowed to get their spouse over? 

I understand love is a very powerful and lovely thing, but to dictate laws based on 'love' is ridiculous to me. I love my family, but doesn't mean I get to fetch everyone over, no matter how close I am with them.

Now for the last part. I understand there are historical reasons. I understand woman used to be property/second class etc and that's why giving her half the asset is something people do. But under all other current laws, women can work for themselves. It's not like an unmarried woman can't inherit her parents assets or whatever. 

Now, is it possible woman make less than men? Yes. However, I think making less isn't a bad thing IF the government has a system that ensures that peoples wages can cover food, water, shelter and healthcare. (health care is also subjective, such as, does every medication count? etc)",changemyview
"CMV: Dr Light is not the villain in the megaman series, he just opened the door for other villains",0,jcatab,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jcatab/cmv_dr_light_is_not_the_villain_in_the_megaman/,9,2020-10-16 22:29:21,"Quick resume: MegaMan is a series of videogames were, usually, a robot has to defeat another group of robots to save the world, it has various ""sagas"" in a chronological order, with the later sagas trying to be more ""mature/edgy"" than the last. As am example, in the 1st series the bad guy is a  crazy scientist, in the 2nd robot hitler, in the 3rd is crazy scientist that wants to end with nature and free will, in the 4th is Jeff Bezos/God Complex manlet and in the 5th is... can't remember.


Now, Dr. Light is a character of the 1st series (classic) that made a robot capable of making choices inside of a spectrum  and to be able to develop a personality and learn, this robot was created as a soldier  and the project was cancelled due to the power source of the robot being a literal nuke...and the robot ran away. A few years later, he made 8 more robots (10 in Powered Up, a remake of the 1st game), 6 with limited concience and sent to work force as ""robot masters"" and 2 with a limited free will that ended as his children personal helper. The events of the 1st game go that the Robot Masters are reprogrammed into weapons so Dr Light's kid, Rock, has to stop them.

Now, Dr. Light is considered as the 1st villain by part of the fanbase because of that, he literally made a walking nuke without a ""turn off"" button and he also made the robot masters that in the 1st game caused a nationwide crisis. In the following games, his design is used by other scientists to make their own robot masters for various kind of tasks (trap disarming, paleontology, construction, submarine exploration, and fair share of robot masters are for war) and, the villain of the classic series take ahold of them and so MegaMan/Rock has to stop them.

There are also the other series, the 2nd series, Megaman X, it has X as the protagonist, he is the ""2nd megaman"", now with free will just like a human, but also waaay more powerful and dangerous, having to go for a 30+ year conditioning program to make sure he wasn't violent. In the plot, he is discovered by Dr. Cain and his blueprints are used to make a new workforce, the Reploids (Replicant Android), humanoid robots with free will...and they go rogue. Starting with 2 reploids murdering a couple, a new brand of robots is born, the Mavericks, a military force made of reploids is created to fight and their leader, Sigma (the robot hitler) turns Maverick. So now we have entire armys and nations full of murderous robots made with Dr Light's blueprints as a base, and unlike the Robot Masters that were workers with weapons, these are born for battle

3rd series, Megaman Zero, deals with the consecuenques of the 2nd one (totalitarist government and destruction of the environment), Light doesn't have much hand

4th series, Megaman ZX, has a villain called Thomas (Light first name) but that's a cameo only.

5th series deals with basically a new step in human evolution, no Light involvement there

Now, why I DON'T think Light is the villain of the series.

He just, opened a door. The robot he made for war was a commission he made (along with Dr. Wily, the bad guy of the 1st series) when he was young and he even stopped the tests himself.

The 1st lot of Robot Masters, those were made solely for the purpose of being a workforce that also happened to be dangerous. I mean, an axe is to cut wood, but I can also use it to harm someone, is the axe manufacturer to blame for that?

2nd-11th lot of Robot Masters. Standarized parts ans blueprints were avilable, so there were more scientists in the blame of the destruction (except for 9, that was Light fault entirely)

X and the reploids. There are no certain reason of why X was created, but the one that has the most approval is that it was built as a response. Robot Masters were becoming more poweful and in the case that Megaman can't fight them anymore, he made X as the ultimate robot. Reploids, if anything, is plagiarism made by Dr. Cain, and due to the free will of the robots, they are to blame of the crimes.

Mavericks. Now is this more Lore heavy, but, various mavericks are made like that due to a virus called the ""Zero"" Virus. Zero being another robot, the ultimate warrior, the bloodthirsty god of destruction, a robot made by...Dr. Wily, the villain of the 1st game who also manufactured the virus.

Megaman Zero and onwards don't have a lot of Dr Light appareances/influence.

So yeah, in my opinion, Dr Light is NOT the 1st Megaman villain, he DID open the door for real villains to take advantage of his inventions and cause destruction, he was dumb as hell, but not malicious.

CMV: Being very earnest is an embarrassing personality flaw and I should be more cynical/witty,19,jca95f,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jca95f/cmv_being_very_earnest_is_an_embarrassing/,42,2020-10-16 21:56:48,"I’m 23 by the way, female

All of my favorite people are cynical, witty, sarcastic and detached, while I am, by nature, almost the complete opposite. I want to be, really badly, but it doesn’t come naturally to me. I care so freaking much! Not necessarily in a “I want to change the world” way, but in my interpersonal relationships and interests. I’m always agonizing over whether I’m a bad person/friend/daughter and how I can be better. I’ve often cried when reading a novel, not because it is sad but because I see so many aspects of myself in a wretched or unsympathetic character, rather than the protagonist who, despite their flaws, always seems so much more noble than I am. 

To give you just one example: I once began to tear up (don’t think anyone noticed) during a literature class in which we were discussing a satirical poem by Alexander Pope (a writer I very much admire). As the class went on I felt my cheeks getting redder and redder until I was holding back tears. The reason? I felt such a close affinity to the subject of Pope’s attack, and apparently the class had a lot of disdain for this character as well, based on their comments. I whole heartedly agreed with their comments, with Pope’s censure, and was even able to laugh at the character’s ridiculousness. However, at some point, my embarrassment eclipsed my ability to laugh about it and all I felt was acutely ashamed to be me. I wasn’t tearful because I was offended, or my feelings were hurt, but because Pope had hit the nail on the head and I could see all my flaws laid bare in that character, and I didn’t want to be that character. This was insane though, because in all honesty I didn’t have that much in common with the character, and the satire wasn’t even all that scathing. But I felt so distraught by this that I actually went to office hours to get some insight from my professor on how to be a person worthy of Pope’s admiration! I was 100 percent serious. It sounds crazy, but I desperately wanted to be approved of by Alexander Pope, and I felt as though I was not passing some kind of “admirable human” test.  

So yeah, you can imagine being around me is... not so fun. I’m overly earnest in other embarrassing ways. For instance I get so absorbed and excited by things I end up looking ridiculous. I do the same when I fall in love. Or admire someone. I might as well be 13 years old. I’m always trying to avoid causing anyone any kind of embarrassment or discomfort but I end up just being “too nice” (you would not believe how many people have called me this, since I was a little girl).

I know this is the most “first world” problem ever, and not worth getting worked up about, but I absolutely hate this about myself. I feel so lame. When I read descriptions online of earnest people I see myself in them but feel nauseated to realize that’s how I come across. I am actually crying over this right now (which probably just proves my point). 

It’s not like I’ve had a sheltered life, which is what people probably assume about me. That’s fine, but it’s just weird, because I’ve been sexually abused, raped, taken advantage of, blah blah blah Somehow I am still not that cynical or witty or cool. I’m just a big over-eager hypersensitive humorless, overly emotional dork. I’m always trying to make people feel good about themselves at all costs, but it probably just annoys everyone. I need to realize that some people can take a bit more than I can. I just feel like my whole personality is extremely cringeworthy, embarrassing and pathetic.

Now there are two ways to read this. In **RAW** (**R**ead **a**s **w**ritten) it would mean that last player draws 110 cards in their turn where other players draw only 10. In **RAI** (**R**ead **a**s **i**ntended) we agree that there is a typo on the rules and every player (last one included) should only draw 10 cards.

This problem arise in any game where there are long rules, rules added over years or expansions or just poorly worded errors. Even juridical system can be seen as system where there are lot of conflicting rules (laws) that have changed and updated over years. Therefore this discussion also include how we should interpret the law.

RAW have one clear advance. It's not ambiguous. If it says 100 cards it means 100 cards. Everyone assumes there are no errors and there is no discussion. But the whole RAW interpretation falls the moment there are two conflicting rules. System can be saved if we agree on a pecking order (for example latest rules always override the older) but it still becomes a problem.

RAI on the other hand have many advantages. Games are more enjoyable when rules are consistent and balanced. RAI allows human errors to occur and writing the rules is more relaxed when you don't have to use extremely specific language. It also allows more fluent game play when people don't spent hours shuffling through book after book of rules to find new interpretations.

In competitive play there are always judges and supreme court to give the final say how to interpret the rules. I just feel that in general RAI is superior way of reading rules. To change my view tell me why I should forgo all the benefits of RAI and just use RAW. Is there a big benefit of RAW that I'm missing?",changemyview

Frank Sinatra, Whitney Houston, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Mariah Carey and many more are prime examples of this. The opinion I have is that great entertainers have more of a chance to be bigger stars than great singers. A few examples of this would be Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, Madonna, Britney Spears, James Brown. While they may have passable or even nice voices, their star power and ability to entertain people made them huge stars without having as much natural singing talent as others.

The Supremes are a music group that’s a prime example of this. Florence Ballard was considered the best singer of the group and was originally its lead singer, but their record label later decided that Diana Ross, while less talented vocally, was a better entertainer and should be made the focal point of the group. As a result, the group became a major success and Diana Ross became one as well as a solo act.

Another example of this is Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera, who both came out at the same time. Christina could sing much better than Britney, but wasn’t really as entertaining or captivating as Britney was in videos or performances. While both became very successful, it was Britney who became the bigger star of the two.

This brings me to my central viewpoint: if given the choice, the vast majority of people would rather be entertained by someone than amazed by someone. So while it is nice to being naturally talented in singing, being a natural entertainer would probably take you further.",changemyview

Gaming Keyboards, you have to spend like $70 dollars on that so it won’t ghost and you won’t have dropped inputs, not to mention you have to get a mechanical keyboard and avoid the membranes Because they are terrible at gaming, so that’s al least $50 if you cheap out on the mechanical 

And don’t even get me started on massively higher frame rate, because this gives you so much advantage in response time and inputs, any person who plays on 200FPS will destroy and 30 or 60 FPS gamer unless they both don’t know how to play the game or the 60FPS person is massively more skilled than the 200FPS dude.

Also I'm saying 'parent', but the point applies to any guardian of a young child.

Becoming a parent means taking on the role of a carer for a human being for at least 18 years (Though that is unfortunately not always the case). As such, a parent is responsible for the child's access to education and health practitioners, clothes, food and a roof over their heads. As such, I strongly believe that a parent is also responsible with the health and diet of their child.

Many parents put their kids in a sporting team at a young age for social and health reasons, which I think is perfectly valid. What I don't understand is how a parent is okay with ruining their child's health because they do not make their child engage in sport or healthy eating habits. These are habits a parent needs to involve their child in to ensure they grow up healthy and strong, which those with overweight children clearly do not.

Raising an overweight child and not making an effort to improve their health is extremely irresponsible as you are setting them up for a steep learning curve or a life of medical problems and self-esteem issues.",changemyview
CMV: WW2 was not the biggest cause for sex role changes in the US,7,jbz7ca,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jbz7ca/cmv_ww2_was_not_the_biggest_cause_for_sex_role/,33,2020-10-16 07:57:08,"This is a summary of a narrative I have picked up on regarding sex role changes in the United States:

""After World War 2 many women had to fill the roles left by the dead men.  It was such a large number of women that society had to redefine the sex roles.  This is why we have been seeing women taking on more responsibilities and spotlight: More women joining the work force, a push for women in STEM areas, women gaining the right to vote, and the rise of the feminist movement.""

While I can see there being some truth to this, I don't think WW2 was as big a factor as people make it out to be for two main reasons.

1.) Warfare has existed for all of human history, so why would only WW2 cause these changes?  I do not know of any evidence for shortages of men from warfare causing such huge changes in the roles of sex happening in the past.

2.) The sex ratio was not **that** drastically changed by WW2.  Unfortuneately I couldn't find exact numbers for the time period, but according to [this website](http://m.statisticstimes.com/demographics/country/us-sex-ratio.php) the sex ratio was 99.5 in 1950, just 6 years after WW2.  I don't think such a small percentage loss of the male population would cause such sex role changes in the society at large.

I don't know what is the biggest factor in causing the shift in sex roles in the US, but I don't think it is WW2.",changemyview

With new states being added, the argument over if they should not have slavery, or should have slavery, as well as simply the souths continuation to want to own slaves, things got heated up and a war broke out. The confederacy solidified their ideals behind owning black people as slaves. A quote from [Confederate Vice President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America) [Alexander H. Stephens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_H._Stephens) says "" \[I\]ts foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests upon the great truth, that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery—subordination to the superior race—is his natural and normal condition. This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth."" Clearly showing what their intent was, and why they are fighting.   


I moved to South Carolina when I was in middle school from up north, and a lot of people that I met and talk to still to this day, jump on the defense of the confederacy as ""My heritage"", and I don't see that at all as a defense, because I sure as shit wouldn't think Germany would accept someone walking around with Nazi flags or Cambodia would accept someone walking around with Khmer Rouge flag, caliming ""heritage"", so I don't think that is justification for waving the Confederate flag. Your heritage, is fueled by hate and commited atrocities, it doesn't deserve any form of celebration.


I have also heard some people say ""They wanted state rights"" (see earlier mentioned quote) and don't really see that as enough reason either, because the rights they wanted the states to have.... was to own slaves.   


I just don't really see how anyone, in this day and age, with the amount of history we have and how easily accessible this information is to get nowadays. If you are proudly waving the confederate flag, you are either a racist, or stupid. I don't really see any justification for it, but I see a few people that I know and they are changing their facebook profile pictures to have the confederate flag on it, or having stickers on their cars, or even getting confederate flag tattoos, or other things, and I just can not wrap my head around that.

-They’re paying taxes for services they don’t often have access to, and they should get a say in how their taxes are spent
-They’re living and participating in their communities and are directly impacted by local elections
-It’s important to have community voices in community matters 
-It helps enfranchise people to this country and their communities, instead of isolating and disenfranchising them 

If people are worried about cultural immersion and assimilation, they should support this because letting people be civically engaged helps build loyalty to their government. Feeling like you have a voice in your community makes you more connected to your community. 

Also, the US is (rhetorically at least) really big on “no taxation without representation” so if someone is paying taxes here, they should get a vote. Voting could also be used as a metric to support citizenship applications, as being civically involved would show intent to stay and be a productive member of society. 

Some notes: 
-I’m an American so this is from a US perspective, but I think it applies to literally anywhere in the world
-By local, I’m thinking county at largest (so county, district, and city elections.) 
-I’m excluding broader elections because 1. It would never be allowed by people who are worried about immigrants taking over the US and 2.

At the very least, significant reform is needed, if not outright dismissal of this doctrine. I'm hoping someone here can help me see the other side of this argument.

The discussion of qualified immunity largely revolves around the many negative examples of obviously  improper police behavior that they are not held accountable for. Just one example that I read which prompted this question:

\- Woman gave police her keys and consent to search her house for her ex, the suspect. She came back to her house having been tear-gassed and windows broken, and her ex wasn't even there. ""Don't excessively tear-gas a house after getting consent from the owner"" wasn't explicitly covered, so the police got qualified immunity and her lawsuit for improper search was dismissed.

**Big disclaimer: Below, I'm talking about the arguments I have personally heard or read. I've searched but I only ever see these hypothetical arguments, never concrete examples.**

The arguments *for* qualified immunity are usually hypothetical, and revolve around the need for police to be able to exercise their duties in good faith without having to second-guess themselves and whether or not they'll be sued. IMO, these arguments grossly exaggerate the scope of the ""problem"" that QI is intended to prevent. Every negative source I can find just lists bad examples and rips into the arguments for QI. Every positive source I can find just list hypothetical after hypothetical but never give a concrete example. I haven't been able to find neutral sources.

Can anyone give an example of a positive use of QI where police were protected from a frivolous lawsuit? Can anyone give any examples of police *not* acting in the public's interest for fear of legal ramifications? I'm hoping for concrete, sourced examples, not hypotheticals.",changemyview

I observed a belief in the hardcore Sanders camp that if Sanders somehow got elected, all would have been well. I admit it would have been a great left wing shift in US politics. But really, how many solidly 'left wing' (in the US standard) members the Congress has? The squad has 4 members. And maybe there are a few like Rho Khanna and Pramila Jayapal. But they're handful. How many progressive senators aside from Sanders?

If the nation had more left right balance, wouldn't you have seen their representations in the house and senates? Instead, you have some token progressive members.

Koreans, like myself, are known to be prideful about the uniqueness  of our culture, and about the history of our resilience against hostile nations. Korea has been used as a foothold for Japan, in order to invade China. The same thing goes for China. What Koreans have always wanted is not only to be an independent state/nation who can hold up on its own,but also a nation that doesn't have a feeling of vulnerabulity. Korea is a small country, in comparison to Russia, China, and Japan, so my ancestors have felt this sense of fear and vulnerability. The meaning of "" Han""  in Hanguk means ""greatness"". The root word for ""China"" means ""moderation"". The meaning of ""nippon/Japan""  means harmony. Koreans, in particular, have always strived for greatness in their own country. You know that Korea actually used to be much bigger country. My ancestors had a huge strip of land a little bit into the Manchurian region of China called ""Balhae"" or Parhae. It was a strip of land that was a part of Korean civilization during the Later Three Kingdoms period. 
The point that I want to get across is that after North Korea's collapse and Korea's eventual reunification Korea should try to annex this strip of land from China, in order to become a bigger country. 

Here's my rationale: if Korea were to become bigger and were to expand its resource and military capacity, then Japan, Russia, and China will decide not to  mess with Korea ever again. Korea has been bullied many times simply because of its smaller size and geographical location. 

How South Korea and its allies would get to this point:

I am aware that  reunification will be the rockiest part in this journey , since opposition to reunification efforts will likely be from citizens in both the southern and northern parts of Korea. South Koreans will complain about the  massive taxes that need to be implemented, in order to fund the restructuring of North Korea. North Koreans would have to literally be de-brainwashed via educational and mental health programs. Despite the backlash, I strongly believe that reunification is key to provide Korea diplomatic leverage for the annexation of present day Balhae. Policy experts must consider ways to making the transition towards unity as smooth as possible. I think the US must give financial aid to South Korea for reunification efforts, so the US will also play a major role.

Once the reunification is complete, which will probably take 10-20 years, there should first be a diplomatic dialogue between  US, Korea, and China about  Korea's interest in claiming Balhae as its rightful owner. Balhae is indeed a strip of land that my ancestors  lived in when the Qing Chinese took it away from them. There are still many biological Koreans still living in this region of China. If negotiations break down, I think the US and the Unified Nation of Korea need to take it by force. China has had a record of human rights abuses against its Muslim population and LGBTQ community. It also has a survelliance and censorship system that limits the rights of its own people. In my view, we need to be tougher on China. They have recently adopted a morw autocratic style of governance, and they have shown aggression in the South China Sea. Having a strong and big Korea will stabilize East Asia. 

As a proud Korean American, I cannot simply allow Korea to be constantly bullied by its neighbors. Helping a Unified Korea take back what was lost centuries ago will force China to get out of its hole and cooperate with its neighbors. Believe it or not,I think a strong and big Korea is in the interests of Japan and the US, since stability in East Asia is what many UN countries  want.

I am aware that I may come off as highly passionate about this issue, but I am also welcome to alternative points of view. Is there any other way of achieving stability in East Asia, thereby putting an end to China's aggression?

P.S: I want to emphasize that I believe Korea is ""key"" to achieving stability in East Asia.",changemyview
CMV: It's actually more dangerous to trust someone in real life than on the Internet,24,jbspst,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jbspst/cmv_its_actually_more_dangerous_to_trust_someone/,21,2020-10-16 02:00:04,"We're constantly told things like ""don't trust anyone online"", ""they could be rapists or murderers"", ""don't play games online with anyone you don't know offline"" etc.

I think this is a flawed argument, and that it's actually a lot more dangerous to trust someone you *do* know offline than someone you only know over the Internet.

Yes, the people you talk to online could secretly be a rapists or murderers, but **so could people you konw in real life**. The people you know from work, school or other places could just as easily be manipulative. And unlike the Internet, those people have direct physical access to you.

If you're being attacked on the Internet (which can only happen verbally, unless you meet in real life), you can simply stop communicating with that person. People you know in real life can *physically* attack you, and you can't just ""block"" them or ""click away"" from the situation. Even if you agree to meet someone from the Internet in real life, they only have as much access to you as other real life people. No more, no less.

People in real life also tend to know others in your area. If you say something they don't like, they can try to get you fired from your job or ruin your reputation at school. Generally, people on the Internet can only ruin your reputation within that specific community, and if that happens, you can just find another one. There are exceptions (some things go super viral) but those are rare. It's not as easy to just find another job or go to another school.

A lot of people will argue that it's easier to fake your identity on the Internet than in real life, and while that's true, it's less true than it used to be. Nowadays, a lot more people are creating videos of themselves and using voice chat, which are a lot harder to fake. Many would argue that you shouldn't do those things and that they'd make you less safe, but that's only technically the truth. To find someone on real life from just a picture or sound, you'd need to already have contact with someone who has their personal info. So once again, it's not people on the Internet that are the problem. I have many issues with forcing the use of voice chat, but this isn't one of them.

Now, I'm not saying you should blindly trust people on the Internet. Basically, the point of my view is that **nobody should be trusted**, but there's less of a risk if that person can only communicate through a computer screen.",changemyview

In this CMV, I am mainly targeting ""forced nationalism,"" where this pride is instilled through predatory, dishonest means such as America. Here's a better title:

A government that uses dishonest and predatory means to generate love for its country fosters a hostile, ignorant environment that has no place in modern society.

I still remember the sound of children droning the pledge of allegiance to the flag every morning before school started. It felt so creepy now that I think about it. Replace the flag with any other object and it would literally be an image of a fanatical cult, worshipping an object that doesn't really have any true significance.

From birth, we are taught to love our country unconditionally. Now, with Trump presenting an idea called ""patriotic education,"" where history is literally rewritten to present America as a country that can do no wrong in order to make is sickening. We all know what grooming is- it's a creepy adult taking advantage of a child's naivete to manipulate them to behave in a way that benefits the adult. This is no different. We are grooming children through biased history in order to have them place their complete trust in a country that, honestly, doesn't deserve that trust. The scariest part is that the government knows exactly what it's doing. It knows that people are thinking too much for themselves, and Americans are no longer the sheep that they can just fire up and weaponize with some buzzwords like ""patriotic,"" ""freedom,"" and ""liberty."" The government needs to indoctrinate the children while they're young because it **knows** that they'll hate the country if they're shown the truth, so instead of owning up to it, the government hides the truth. See how Tiananmen Squarey this sounds? You should trust a country on your own accord, not because someone forced those beliefs onto you in your impressionable youth.

At the core of it, pledge of allegiance and patriotic education notwithstanding, the entire idea of loving your own country is just plain weird. Like sure, I happened to be born on this part of the giant rock we call Earth. That doesn't mean I have to love the land, I just live here. The idea of ""loving your country"" only serves as a purpose to brainwash its people and use ""the country"" as an excuse for the government to do whatever they please to the people. ""You're going to war to die **for our country**."" It's like they are trying to train every child to be like a sleeper agent that will only be activated through patriotic spirit- it clouds logical reasoning, and it promotes thinking based on emotions- after all, love is an inherently obsessive emotion- it causes you to see the subject in rose colored lens, and still be attracted to them no matter what. It's ok to be proud that you get to live in a good country. But to be forced to obsessively love it no matter how much wrong it has done has no place in a modern, civilized society.

Sure, this type of thinking may have gotten us through the old times as tribal people when it was important that every man was able to fight for their clan with no hesitation, nowadays it's meaningless. If anything, it only promotes violence between countries, and hostility between people; all because they happened to be born in different places. It causes people in more powerful countries to feel a superiority complex, which is a precursor to racism, and ultimately drives humanity as a whole further apart.",changemyview

Similarly allow prostitution and gambling to be legal and regulated nationwide.  These have no business being criminal issues.  People should have total freedom over their own bodies so long as it does not harm anyone else.

&#x200B;

Abolish the federal reserve and take back the power of currency creation.  Create a rigid, unmovable target such as 2% of GDP, they always talk about their 2% inflation targets, of new currency that is created every year debt free.  At current levels that would be about 400 billion dollars annually in debt free national income.

&#x200B;

Abolishing income tax for the vast majority of Americans and replacing it with progressive sales tax structures.  Allow the first 250k of income to be debt free.  Have a very progressive tax structure after that. Such as 25% to 1mil, 35% to 10mil, 45% to 100mil etc.  This coupled with aggressive sales tax on luxury goods would more than make up the difference especially with the currency creation listed above.  For most Americans that weight of income tax being removed would be extremely beneficial.

&#x200B;

These are three things that I think could be implemented fairly quickly.  During one presidential term you could probably see all of these things operating smoothly.

&#x200B;

Slightly more difficult but just as important.

&#x200B;

Drastically scale back military expenditures.  From nearly 1 trillion annually this needs to fall to 100 billion or less.

&#x200B;

Start investing funds in plans to take US transportation off the ground.  Drone transport is very nearly a reality and with a government funded push we could see a major switch in one generation.  The infrastructure cost savings over time would be astronomical.  Part two of this is drastically increasing funding to push for both fully renewable power and power storage research.  We need electricity to become both clean and abundantly available.  Also more funding for new alternative sources of power, fusion power or something similar.  Desalination on a mass scale.  Will unlimited energy potential desalination and water transport becomes simple.

&#x200B;

Some things that I think are fairly complex to change but definitely doable is an overhaul of the healthcare and education systems.  If you hadn't noticed from the tone of this I tend to hold fairly libertarian ideals.  I was a Bernie fan, although that was more because I trusted his honest and sincerity to do right by the American people.  I would be willing to give a socialized healtcare / education system a chance but I truly believe that if you got lobbying out of politics it would be come a non issue.  I think that the government getting in bed with these two industries over the past half century are what have driven the prices sky high and the quality down.  I believe that being forced into a competitive environment both of these would see rapid reductions in price and would become affordable over a generation or so to the point these would not be an issue.  If I could put myself through college debt free while working part time at a fast food joint as was true for our grandparents / parents I wouldn't really care about it being free.

Nobody gets to dictate how they are perceived. For millenia it was obvious how to perceive someone's gender because it was equivalent to their sex.

There is no denying that. 

However, she was just a young college student and wasn't a violent person. High school kids who acted dumb like this by stealing wouldn't get in major trouble, and college students aren't that more mature. She did a minor crime, which doesn't deserve an arrest. She should have just gotten a fine as a punishment. Instead, she was humiliated in front of everyone by being put in handcuffs and taken to jail.

Now, she has her whole life ruined because of a permanent criminal record for larceny (theft) just because she was just an emotional 18 year old. I believe that is too harsh of a punishment.",changemyview
CMV: voting systems used to elect government officials should give as much weight to disfavor as to favor,1,jbrd0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jbrd0v/cmv_voting_systems_used_to_elect_government/,8,2020-10-16 00:52:21,"In an election with more than two candidates, most voting systems currently used place more importance on who a voter favors than on who a voter *disfavors*. In [plurality voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting), the system used for most elections in the US, for example, disfavor is split evenly among all candidates aside from the voter's single selection. In [instant-runoff voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting), the importance of disfavor increases with each round, but the first round is identical to plurality.

[Approval voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting) gives equal importance to favor and disfavor, as does the [Condorcet method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method). The latter may even emphasize disfavor *more* in some situations.

Punishing candidates who are hated by a large fraction of the electorate helps to reduce polarization in politics. Polarization may not always be a bad thing (abolishing slavery was a polarizing issue), but I'd be willing to be it's a bad thing more often than not.

Imagine a country with a history of ethnic violence with a three-way race for president. Candidates A and B each want one side to *win* that struggle while C is promoting a peaceful resolution with the potential for long-term stability. Most people outside the conflict would see C as the obviously superior option. A and B are disfavored by both the other side and by those who are neutral, or who have a side, but are tired of the violence. C is favored by the latter, and not strongly disfavored by any group.  Assuming the three groups are roughly equal in size, C is the likely winner with approval, Condorcet, or other methods that place strong emphasis on that disfavor, but each candidate has an equal chance of winning plurality or instant-runoff.

The position I'm taking here isn't in favor of any particular voting system, so pointing out unrelated flaws doesn't change my view. Rather, I'm focused on the idea that widely-hated candidates shouldn't win.",changemyview
CMV: the current iteration of conservatism in the West (mainly North America) is incompatible with modern society and should be abolished and/or reformed.,0,jbpm85,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jbpm85/cmv_the_current_iteration_of_conservatism_in_the/,104,2020-10-15 23:24:01,"Disclaimer: I do not claim at all to be non-partisan. I am also not left-leaning, and this has absolutely nothing to do with how much better I perceive the “other side” to be. I would like for this discussion to be purely based on the merits of what I have said and do not want to see any both sidesisms. I also do not claim that all conservatives are villains.

It is good, essential even, to have differing viewpoints on what we can do to make society better. But I believe that this is not the objective of conservatives today. Conservatives, many decades ago, were the party of small government and workers rights. Today, those very same conservatives fight to impose their religious views on the rest of society. I mean, the Republican Party in the U.S.A is openly waging a war against abortion rights, against transgender and LGBTQ rights, are union-busters, amongst a mishmash of other things. In Canada, the CPC is currently under the control of the so-con faction that is again waging war against worker’s rights, cutting healthcare, cutting education, all for the goal of slashing taxes for the 1% and corporations.

In my opinion, modern society wants:
- a livable wage
- environmental protections
- protections for minority groups
- abortion rights (the majority of people in most countries consider that abortion should be a right but conservatives are currently and actively attempting to subvert and undermine that)
- social programs i.e. universal healthcare, pharmacare, childcare, affordable education, etc.
- compassionate, science and fact based policies designed to help people and not corporations 

I can’t think any Conservative party in North America who supports any of these policies which I posit to be objectively good for society, and also hold popular support amongst the majority. And it is holding us back. There should be no reason why modern conservatives practice trickle down economics which they claim to work but never has worked in the history of society. Not to talk of, blatantly undermining our democratic process. Republicans have outright and openly stated that their goal is to get less people to vote. GOP states have pushed against Medicaid expansions to help their own citizens, benefiting nobody. GOP states continue to impose undue burdens on the right to vote (see Florida; see Georgia; see Texas). Conservatives have openly stated that “regulation” is a bad thing; those same conservatives remove regulations which are intended to protect the environment or some other essential part of society. Which one of these actions are indicative of the laws of a modern, free, and progressive society?

I believe that conservatives parties no longer stand for conservatism. They simply exist to oppose. The Senate Majority Leader filibustered his own bill just because Democrats were the ones who wanted it passed. The CPC claimed that a law that bans conversion therapy is “divisive” which I just do not understand.

Again I believe that for society to thrive, there should be differing opinions. But that is no longer the case. I believe that (specifically with regards to politics), conservatism should be abolished. To clarify, not necessarily the ideology of conservatism itself, but the political parties which represent it. The Republican Party does not belong in a modern, progressive society. I would argue that the Libertarian party (which is honestly another branch of conservatism) does not belong in modern society either; they believe in the free market and the free market has shown time and time again they will prioritize profits over people. The CPC has been, as I said above, taken hostage by the social conservatives. 

There should be opposition to the status quo. This is why I believe that these parties should be abolished and completely reformed.",changemyview

This leads to bacteria developing resistance to antibiotics, which means that such antibiotics can no longer be effective for human use, and result in deaths from various infections that could otherwise be prevented.  

Banning the use of antibiotics would essentially destroy the current business model of the meat industry in the US, and make meat much more expensive.

As such, I suggest a lineage-based preference system rather than race.

I would support an affirmative action system that specifically considers descendants of certain groups rather than entire races. This would include ADOS (American Descendants of Slavery), Irish indentured servants, most Native American groups, and descendants of Japanese internment camps. If a college applicant wishes to prove their lineage belonging to one of these groups, they should have to submit their ancestry documentation, and be able to receive concrete and specific extra points on their applications based on that.

People who do not belong to any of these groups would receive neither preferential treatment nor discrimination, and be treated in the same way as every other applicant. This way, I am suggesting an affirmative action system that aids the victims of historical injustice while not punishing the average person who was not part of perpetrating those acts, and avoiding generalizations based on race. This is an effort to give aid to those who actually need it while minimizing the number of those negatively affected.

Additionally, by providing specific and tangible points based on membership in above groups, this can be seen as a quantifiable act of reparation rather than nebulous ""preferences"" as practiced by private institutions.

I know there are many here who oppose affirmative action altogether, and those views are certainly welcome, but am particularly interested in hearing from those who support the current American affirmative action system.",changemyview
CMV: The 19 year old girl who married the 90-year-old man for his money didn't do a bad thing,0,jbn62j,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jbn62j/cmv_the_19_year_old_girl_who_married_the/,26,2020-10-15 21:06:06,"For those who don't know the backstory, the TL;DR is the title and the longer version is in [this](https://twitter.com/JackWilliamRtF/status/1315756888806617088) twitter thread and you will get some more info while I'm explaining my stance.

Now as to why I don't think it's a big deal. I won't make the argument that he is also getting something out of it because he has dementia but I will make the argument that it really doesn't matter who gets his money here and here it is:

1) His wife and son have died and he has absolutely one else if we leave this 19 year old girl (now wife!) out of the picture, so the trust fund he had for his son/wife I would assume would be donated after he died if no one is there to claim it right? I think that's who it works. which is pretty good! but it doesn't matter because his money will still get donated even after the girl gets it and I will explain why in a sec.

2) No one knows how much money we are talking about anyway. This 19 year old girl says he is so wealthy that she is gana vomit and etc, but also says she was homeless at one point. so for all we know, 100k could be vomiting worthy money to her. Now I think its probably more than that but still, since we don't know how much it is we can only assume, lets say if its 2 million, bro who cares, like 2 million in the world is honestly pocket change. you see 16-year-olds becoming millionaires on ticktock every other day at this point. Go complain why some of these billionaires aren’t donating their wealth (which I actually think they shouldn't but that's a discussion for another day).

3) Now as to how his money will get donated at the end of the day anyways. Lets say we are talking about 100 million here in inheritance. again no one knows how much he has. If this girl gets his money instead of it being directly donated, what is she going to do with it, with 100 million? she is gana live 80 years, buying laptops, going to vacations, buying jewelry, getting married, having kids, sending here kids to private schools, buying a lambo maybe. It gana help the economy, maybe her kids are gana become something one day, and lets say when she buys a Microsoft laptop, someone like bill gates is gana profit yes but he is also going to donate 100% of his wealth. and there are other people in the world that she is gana spend money on their products and they have pledged to donate the majority of their wealth. It's gana help that mom and pop shop down the street she buys coffee from to pay their bills. it may take 100 years for that money to end up being fully donated but it will happened regardless and someone lived their dream life in the process. 

And again none of this matter if all we are talking about is a couple of million dollars because it is literally worth nothing. I'm happy to hear why I'm wrong. After all I'm here for a reason, to get my view changed.",changemyview

"CMV: LGBTQ+ being innate is an irrelevant (and possibly wrong, to an extent) argument",22,jbhzog,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jbhzog/cmv_lgbtq_being_innate_is_an_irrelevant_and/,107,2020-10-15 13:59:02,"This post was sparked by some OutOfTheLoop post where apparently ""sexual preference"" is now an offensive term.

  


The political argument surrounding LGBTQ+ is that such people are deserving of equal rights as any cis person. Given this argument, it's irrelevant whether this sexual orientation is by choice or from birth. Arguing that ""we are born this way"" is a biological argument (thus no one cares), not a political one, and none of us know whether it is correct or not. If I had to take a guess I'd say it's a mix between genetics and circumstance, but whats the point?

  


Bottom line, saying that LGBTQ+ orientation is from birth is an apologetic and archaic argument that hurts the movement because it derails the argument. Somewhere, sometime long ago when an LGBTq+ person was told ""Gay is bad!"", They answered ""But I was born this way!"" Instead of ""no its not""


EDIT: i was unclear. I don't know who is the person who said ""sexual preference"" and people got angry. I dont have context. If it is a primitive person who used the term as an attack on gay people then naturally I oppose that person. But, this CMV is about the broader, more higher level of the discussion than a specific person saying a specific thing.

EDIT2: im having the exact same arguments with different commenters, so im just posting here:

There are practical advantages to agreeing on the innateness of lgbtq+. It helps with the law, with religion... Etc.

It will not help if we learn that there *are* environmental factors. It won't help if someone were to transition without having proof of life-long personal trauma of being stuck in the wrong body. You know, they want to transition because that's they feel is good for them. Without it being innate.

It will not help in other fronts: like discrimination based on religion, party affiliation, life style choices, and who knows whatever else isn't innate and people still discriminate against.

And maybe focusing on labeling LGBTQ+ as innate is missing the point. And it just delays the next struggle. Or maybe it will never be enough because the source of hate against LGBTQ+ has nothing to do with it being innate or not, and those who oppose the movement will just find different reasons to hate.

EDIT3:
i feel the need to point out that i am a cis male, not american. i entirely and whole-hearted support lgbtq+ equality and i attempt to share my empathy and sympathy with those who have suffered from being wrongly persecuted and discriminated against on account of their sexual orientation, and i would never do such a thing myself.

however, as a male cis, i do not encounter personally said discrimination. this might make my comments sound insensitive, as if i don't care, and even some people confuse me as to being homophobic, which i would never be.

reading this thread has made me realize that maybe the ground-level discussion around these issues (with the common layman ""god-hates-everything-that-doesn't-go-to-the-church-in-my-suburb""), outside of my relatively-high-society facebook circle, is incredibly primitive, outright stupid. which means those arguing our side might have to resort to stupid arguments.",changemyview

Especially comparing the level of influence. They should strike everyone on the same level, for example the president has had many tweets ""flagged"", he should be banned by now.

Facebook's attitude towards censoring everyone except for celebrities and government officials when it comes to spreading false information boggles my mind. I believe it's hypocritical as well. Especially when they allow other parties or countries to infiltrate their system and sway the American people in a way that's not beneficial to the country itself.

Google - when it comes to YouTube-a lot of content creators that don't have a lot of following get Shadow banned or get strikes for sensitive content however we see advertisements and propaganda that is spread by Major broadcasting corporations, political parties, and other high officials. But those still persist.

I understand there is money involved in all of this-i am just pointing out that there is a level of hypocrisy amongst a lot of these social media platforms when it comes to information and encouragement of certain ideologies.

I can't trust these companies when they say they stand for the betterment of humanity-or they stand with Hong Kong-or they stand with the lgbtq community-or any other pandering or sjw or super PC narrative they're trying to push, because the actions they allow (encourage) from people with money and status does not match with what they say.",changemyview

She also could have had the extra screen time to actually bond with the other characters and even share at least one line of dialogue with her own daughter. 

Nebula and Gamora could have completed their character arcs that have been in motion for years worth of cinema by ending the tyrannical reign of their abusive, homicidal father together.

"CMV: Without religion and the promise of an afterlife there’s no real good reason to find abortion reprehensible. In fact, to prevent them is one of the most profoundly uncaring and selfish acts one human can inflict on another. But let’s blame god.",0,jbgr1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jbgr1j/cmv_without_religion_and_the_promise_of_an/,73,2020-10-15 12:21:09,"If there’s no afterlife then the “life” of a fetus is only barely less profound than that of a 100 year old, except in that it experienced much less pain before passing back into oblivion. 

We come from oblivion and back into oblivion we return. In between, while we live, we have vastly different experiences. Some terrible. Some wonderful. Some both terrible and wonderful.

I’m not depressed or unhappy.  I am loved and I love. I have experienced pleasure and pain.  Despite these truths, if my mother decided before I was born that I was only going to mess up her life, and she had a way out, I’m totally indifferent to her having made that decision. 

After all, regardless of my realized potential to become the complex philosophical magnate I am today (/s), I wouldn’t know what I could be missing.  I would have been some cells. Maybe I started to develop far enough that I could feel some electrical impulses. Maybe I knew hunger because my mother was too poor to be properly nourished. Maybe I knew addiction because my nutrient source was a junkie.  Name a hundred possible things I felt without comprehension. Name two hundred. Does it matter which things I experienced but did not comprehend?

And with a poke and a pull it’s all over. I know no pain. I know no fear. Sure, I knew no pleasure, but I am in oblivion and am oblivious of the fact. Or any other. I was a blip. No different than a miscarriage. Except maybe that the miscarried fetus was wanted. Needed.  I wasn’t. I don’t care. I can’t care. The electricity that flowed between my cells is gone. I know nothing. 

But here’s the crux of this CMV. Religion. The idea that there could be something more.  And if there is, have I missed the eternal reward of heaven?  I think most theologians would say no.  An aborted fetus committed no sin and should ascend to the most holy place.  

That’s assuming I want to be there. I liked oblivion. 

For those of us that cannot accept the anecdotal “evidence” of a higher power, religion remains a twisted construct of man. Possibly wrought of a desperate desire to explain the confusing wonders of nature. But now...terribly corrupted for the gain of few at the expense of a great many. 

And who suffers?  Not the fetus. Not in any lasting way. Unless he is born. No, it’s the living and vibrant lives that have agonizingly (or callously, who cares, not I) concluded that a new life is unwelcome. For whatever reason. I’d rather know oblivion than abject disregard, violent outbursts of a drunken parent who never wanted any kids in the first place, abduction and torture, to bounce between foster homes until I am shunned and ridiculed for needing an abortion of my own. Why so dour?  I know, some people get lucky.  They’re born and things turn out mostly okay. 

I digress.  Back to the reason it’s wrong to have abortions. Religion. Because if you think without THAT any reason you can come up with will make an unborn child suddenly wish they could leave their wonderful oblivion, to partake of this world you’re lying to yourself. 

If you haven’t figured it out yet, I’m an atheist. Thoroughly anticipating my oblivion over heaven or hell. I say this in closing only because I want to end with this: even if I’m wrong about god, and there’s one out there, they are shit if they send aborted babies to hell. And if they don’t that, they send them to heaven, then these kiddos are getting a really easy ride to heaven and I feel gypped.

Long Edit: It seems to be a recurring theme from replies that I think morality is moot.  I didn’t intend to imply this at all. I could have gone on about all the positive things people do, are, and their deep value inter socially on the very small scale of our little planet. But that wasn’t the point of my view, so I didn’t. 

But since it apparently needs to be stated directly: Morality matters and religion is not where it comes from. Even those that think it does are deceived. It comes from within ourselves. Though not everyone has it in equal measure or agreement with the majority.  Immorality also comes from within, for lack of understanding why what the majority agrees on is right. People just align what’s inside with the dogma that fits, or fake it. Yes, people can learn another way, but the lies of religion do not have our best in mind. 

No, what I was going for is that without god, or an afterlife, their control is on such shaky ground that they will not get their way in the end. I don’t think the core principles of the leaders of ANY religion are about love and the sanctity of life. I think most of them know the whole thing is a money making scam. It’s about controlling the money by means of controlling the populace.  And more people means more workers. And more workers means more tithes. 

I’m not meaning to imply that I think that’s what anyone in a religion feels, believes or thinks. I’m saying that there is a hierarchy and at the top where all the money is, they do everything they can retain control. Of every aspect of our lives that they can.  Greed and power. 

For the purpose of increasing tithes for the next generation they say be fruitful and multiply. Babies workers tithes jackpot. Abortion is bad!  But not for the loss of life.  Some truly do believe that and that’s fine to feel that way. But it’s not justified by what is real. 

I’m not saying go kill people. But the end of a life is not such a terrible thing. Do not fear it. And do not fear life because of the risk of hell. The thing to fear is here on earth. Instead, live your best life without hurting others and when you die it’s a peaceful rest in oblivion.  We should do our best to care for everyone, but when it’s time to let someone go, let them go. 

But as I’ve said repeatedly tonight in various places, education and contraception first.  Do everything to make abortion unnecessary. I don’t love abortion, I’m not encouraging we seek and destroy fetuses with reckless abandon. No.  We have the means, so why is it so difficult to spread knowledge and provide?  Dogma and the scapegoats therein.

Women, imo, should definitely have the option of abortion. No woman should be required to carry a child she has no want for especially under extreme circumstances. The issue is, i feel like that gives women supreme authority on whether a man becomes a father or not. If he wants it and she doesn’t. The baby could be aborted. If he doesn’t want it and she does, he now has to pay child support if the woman so chooses to take him to court.

I do not wish for my view to be misunderstood as that I support minors voting, of any age really. As a general rule I do not support minors having a vote of any age. However, I do not believe that you can tax a class of people that have not committed a felony at the same rates as any legal adult and not afford the right of voting to them.

While the post is not about a solution to this, it is for my mind to be changed about why the current dynamic is not inherently unjust, I would like to clarify what options I believe would be available, as it gives a better understanding of my mindset. 

I believe you could afford minors that pay taxes on earned wages or other income types the right to vote. I would not be overly enthusiastic about this option but I would suspect the judgement of working teens will on average be at least a bit better. 

I believe you could lower the tax rate for minors or abolish it completely. Personally I would advocate for the abolishment of taxing working teenagers if they will not be able to vote, but I don’t believe there’d ever be an untaxed group of working Americans ever. So a reduced tax rate for minors seems like a good middle ground.

But if you look past all the ""heees a baaad man's"" or ""stop lying to the American public's,"" Stephen A.'s ability to form relationships with the people he covers is unparalleled within sports media and deserves to be praised.

The man has had an illustrious journalism career. He started as a high school reporter and quickly worked his way up. But for me, his journalistic prowess has mostly become apparent through his work on First Take, which I know sounds kinda weird considering the stuff he says on the show, but hear me out. 

His investigative journalism is kinda sus to say the least (read this article if you're not sure what I mean: [https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/6/12/18662086/stephen-a-smith-never-wrong-nba](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/6/12/18662086/stephen-a-smith-never-wrong-nba)) but his ability to form relationships is out of this world. He is somehow close friends with every great retired and active NBA or NFL athlete, something that's unprecedented for someone who works in media. And sure, maybe he's just friends with them because he's a social dude and he enjoys the company, but there's no denying that these relationships have produced results. First Take is just about the only sports talk show that gets superstars to appear on a frequent basis, and almost every time they're there, it's clear they only came because of Stephen A. I mean, just look at the Russ ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zx3I0fEqpgs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zx3I0fEqpgs)) or Rondo ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0mL7h\_3WEU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0mL7h_3WEU)) interviews from yesterday. This has mostly just produced great television and a hundred clickbait articles, but if not for his relationship with Stephen A., it's possible that Magic Johnson never goes public with the story about Rob Pelinka backstabbing him. I remember there being some other examples of new getting broken through Stephen A. interviews, but I can't find them right now.",changemyview

CMV: “Being the bigger person” as a concept is idealistic and naive at best and openly harmful at worst,20,jbcoza,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jbcoza/cmv_being_the_bigger_person_as_a_concept_is/,31,2020-10-15 08:00:35,"You hear this expression in a multitude of ways - if not as written, then perhaps “When they go low, we go high”, or “karma will get them back.” The problem is, in my eyes, that the society that we have cultivated does not reward this kind of moral victory, and conflates it with weakness and submission.

Firstly, the essence of this phrase is rooted in the idea that a moral victory is the best way to prove yourself as being the better person in the debate, and less willing to stoop to the level of your opponent. Once again, we saw this in the Michelle Obama quote: “When they go low, we go high.” But this approach functionally achieved nothing - going “high” in bipartisan approaches was just met with “low” mudslinging and eventually Obama stopped reaching across the aisle. So essentially, the “low” tactics worked more effectively, which I feel highlights the first issue I have with the phrase - holding the moral victory does not matter in a world where morality is either unimportant or subjective enough to literally be whatever it needs to be for one’s current situation. We find this situation repeated with one of history’s greatest proponents of the idea - Mohandas Gandhi, whose hunger strikes and non-violence were largely initially ignored by the British Raj, since the moral high ground did not matter to them. Only after military force was applied, and the financial exhaustion of the Raj after the war came to a head, did Britain leave India. 

Furthermore, the idea of Karma, and the more simplistic way children are taught to “be the bigger person” and not “stoop to their level” in school and throughout their childhood. Both were common quotes from my teachers and authority figures through my childhood, but ultimately, I would find friends who were being bullied trying to adopt this strategy, and it being taken for weakness or submission. The moral high ground held little comfort over physical pain. Yet, when they would actively oppose bullies, either by choosing to defend themselves, or confront them in other ways, they would see results.

I’ve always believed in this ideal, and think that a world where this was an approach we could take would be, for all intents and purposes, a better world. But my experience irl with it has significantly disillusioned me, so I’d like to hear people’s thoughts on the idea.",changemyview
"CMV: Phrases like ""toxic masculinity"" and ""white fragility,"" while describing real and problematic social issues, are unnecessarily divisive and incendiary and should be replaced with less offensive sounding terms.",294,jbcisu,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jbcisu/cmv_phrases_like_toxic_masculinity_and_white/,299,2020-10-15 07:50:26,"These kinds of phrases are generally used by the left. And I find this odd, because the left is otherwise *very* concerned with using and even policing language that merely *might* be perceived as offensive or off putting. These are people who use wordings like ""people who menstruate"" to avoid possibly offending the small minority of trans men who have periods, or ""people of color"" to help emphasize personhood before race, and in my short lifetime have coined half a dozen different terms for ""mental illness"" to make it as soft a label as possible. In short, the left generally seems *very* concerned about ensuring language is used in such a way that it rubs as few people the wrong way as possible. 

Yet all this seems to go out the window when it comes to men and white people. Terms like ""white fragility"" or ""toxic masculinity"" follow the opposite pattern: they seem to be deliberately crafted to be inflammatory and cause shock and offense among the people they are applied to. Again, **i do believe they describe real phenomena,** but the way they're termed seems almost guaranteed to put whites and men off from wanting to have the conversation in the first place, particularly when its not whites or men using the terms while addressing whites or men. 

For example, similar to toxic masculinity, its not exactly controversial to say there are some negative cultural aspects within the black community practiced and reinforced by black folks that work to the detriment of black folks and those they interact with. Even if you don't believe this is the case just grant it for the sake of argument; not even the most insane, tone deft progressive in the world would think its advisable to term this phenomenon ""toxic blackness"" and then send in white people to criticize black folks for their ""toxic blackness."" Such a thing would be *immediately* recognized by progressives as problematic, counterproductive, and a good way to turn black folks off from the conversation before it even begins. 

Its my view that terms like ""toxic masculinity"" or ""white fragility"" should be seen the same way. While I'm sure that the mere shock value alone has caused some white folks or men to pay attention it seems to me it drives far more of them away and unnecessarily predisposes them to be against the concept before they even hear what it is. To take an extreme hyperbolic example you could observe a very real and pressing social issue among X demographic, but if you decide to call it ""X people are little whiney-ass bitches"" you're gonna create shock value, but you're also gonna turn off 90% of X demographic from wanting to discuss the issue simply by virtue of how you named it.",changemyview

If you do your due diligence before having consensual sex with someone( asking for an ID, asking their friends to verify their age, etc) and they lie or provide a fake ID, you should be home free.


By doing this kind of research upfront you prove that you're not some raving sex pest out on the prowl for unsuspecting children. You prove you're not a danger to anyone because you're only looking for of age partners. What good does it do for society to lock someone like that up and have their name stuck on a sex offender list? 


There are exceptions though, obviously:

(1)They have to look of age.
Obviously this one's a bit tricky because it's subjective. Obviously if a 14 year old hands you a fake ID you should be able to tell they're not of age. Or, at the very least, your suspicion should stop anything from happening. But, id bet my life that if you got a 17(maybe 16) and an 18 year old, dressed them the same, and stood them next to one another that a regular person would be able to distinguish their age.


(2)You have to actually be able to prove you made a genuine effort. 

This one's a little obvious but should still be said. You can't just ask once and then take them at their word. Any fake documents should be reasonably fake. Also you need proof that you even asked.


(3)Some ages are just exempt from this. 

Id say the cutoff should be 15, maybe 16 . Any reasonable person should be able to tell a person that young is not 18. Or, the amount of hoops you'd have to jump through to be genuinely fooled by that would make you dangerous irresponsible anyway. 

(Sub argument: Maybe if one person is under 21 and the other is no younger than 17 and a half, even if they don't verify their age, charges should be reduced?

Only a lightning to USB-C cable will be included.

Their reasoning basically is that a lot of people already will have a charging brick and headphones that they can use and by removing them from they can reduce electronic waste and reduce their CO2 footprint (e.g. smaller packaging, more can be shipped at once).

I think this is a win-win-lose situation. Win for Apple, win for the environment, lose for the customer.

**Win for the environment**

Basically I agree with what they said. A lot of people already have headphones and charging bricks with lightning cables that they can use. Not everyone, but basically everyone who upgrades from any iPhone 5 or later.

Being able to send more iPhone in one container due the smaller packaging also sounds right for me.

So compared to shipping them with charging brick and headphones it's a win for the environment.

**Win for Apple**

""We can then reduce the price of the iPhone, because without headphones and charging bricks it should cost less for the customer!""... probably said no one at Apple. 

Also being able to ship more iPhones in one container should reduce their shipping costs and being able to sell charging bricks and headphones to some customers should give them some extra profit.

---

**Lose for the customer**

My first thought was: ""Well, they are right."" I charge my phone wireless and use bluetooth headphones anyway, while I also have multiple multi charging bricks and lightning to USB-A cables. 

Still I get one less charging brick that I could use for something, one less pair of headphones that I could store for ""emergencies"" if my bluetooth headphones are out of battery and of course there are also customers who will have to buy headphones and/or a charging brick, because they simply don't have one.

CMV: Economic growth is no longer a great indicator for social welfare,21,jb6d15,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jb6d15/cmv_economic_growth_is_no_longer_a_great/,25,2020-10-15 02:24:12,"This  view was partly inspired by the podcast linked below. If you don't want  to listen, the gist is that instead of trying to achieve limitless  growth, we should be striving for a balance (The ""doughnut model."" )  between meeting people's needs (avoiding the doughnut hole) and  overextending resources (extending beyond the outside of the doughnut).

[https://freakonomics.com/podcast/doughnut-economics/](https://freakonomics.com/podcast/doughnut-economics/)

For  the past century or so, economic growth has been strongly associated  with human and society advancement. A rising tide lifts all boats, and  as long as we were growing the GDP we were improving people's lives. It  brought us out of subsistence farming and into an era of prosperity. It  created and abundance of food, medicine, technology, etc. Human welfare,  life expectancy, leisure, etc all grew thanks to healthy production.  Endless debates were had on whether capitalism or communism was better  for growth. There is no doubt in my mind that we are where we are  largely because of the rapid industrialization and continued focus on  having the best economic growth.

People  have this assumption that this is still the case but it may not be. I  had this realization when thinking about the Republican platform... just  about every policy can be linked to their desire for unfettered growth.  Environmental protection, wealth distribution, etc etc are all seen as  2nd fiddle to a rising GDP. They have this fear or notion that anything  that slows the economy will ultimately crash western civilization as we  know it. I think this is no longer true, or at least it's only true  because we have foolishly structured society around this concept. We  have reached a point where production is no longer the issue. Human  welfare is no longer tied to production or new technology, but to  distribution of resources. A rising GDP now only gives us marginal gains  toward a healthy society, and in some cases is starting to work against  it, destroying the environment and leaving us vulnerable to catastrophe  and economic depressions.

Don't  get me wrong, I still think innovation and technology has the ability to  benefit society. But I think it is marginal at best. I'm not advocating  for abandoning production or for allowing the economy to stagnate. But I  don't think it's the most important factor. It isn't sustainable. We  have the resources and ability to have a healthy society with what we  have now.  In fact we have an abundance. Resources are limited, yet we  act like we can grow forever. We shouldn't be afraid of strong  environmental regulations, or wealth taxes, or welfare, or business  regulation. Will that stifle business growth and innovation? Yeah,  probably to some extent. Maybe even a large extent. But it doesn't  really matter if it means that social welfare increases and resources  are better preserved.

Of course  this view is largely centered on 1st world nation economies, there are  many economies around the world that can still benefit from rapid  economic growth (they are still in the doughnut hole, so to speak).",changemyview

I think that, for the most part, the US Army would do a better job of enforcing the law than municipal police forces. They are held accountable (more than the police at least) through court martials and Military Police of their own to prevent abuses and broken laws on their part while the average police force in the US has little to no oversight and the result is a horrendous criminal justice system that suffers from inequality and corruption. Furthermore, the ability to reassign soldiers to different parts of the country as needed would solve a lot of issues related to understaffed areas where it takes an hour to respond to a call. Also they are trained in the rules of engagement where municipal police tend to shoot first, ask questions later. In short, the US military has the budget to project power all over the world; instead they should be focused towards keeping our country safe and I believe they could do it better than our traditional police forces. I understand the bad optics of a military occupation but we're already living like that with the police force we currently have so appearances aside it would be a net positive.

While evidence goes both ways, some things can also not be considered good evidence for them. This is especially in response to the Internet Historian video concerning it. But I doubt I would get any argument from youtube comments, which seemed to unanimously disagree with me. (Even though IH himself seems to think it was a hoax as well). So here are just a few points I thought distinguished themselves.

**Personal testimony from any of them:** They can say what they want, not every word is the truth. For example, they wouldn't intentionally say something that would incriminate them.

**Established experiments:** If this WAS a hoax, it wouldn't be a one time thing. He would absolutely have to have established and performed many experiments before he could get it right.

**Reaction/Acting:** We can't confirm whether the reaction was real or fake. In a very detailed and thought out hoax (if it was a hoax) they aren't going to half-ass their reaction. Acting out anger and despair like that is easier than acting out other more mild emotions. While the kid did not sound very convincing to me, ""dad! Falcons in there! Dad! Falcon... Dad! Falcon... Dad! Falcon is in there. Dad! Falcon is in there."" He sounded more like he re-stating a memorized statement, without the right amount of emotion. Meanwhile, the dad is yelling and screaming over everyone so you can't even here his wifes response. He starts freaking out before the thing is hardly out of arms reach, but doesn't seem to make any attempt to save it other than to scream at his wife. 

**Whether the kid was in the balloon or not:** This doesn't even matter. Whether in either scenario the kid wouldn't be in the balloon.

**Kid's excuse:** This is one of the most interesting occurrences. The kid was specifically mentioning that his parent's were telling him to do something for the show. He obviously didn't know if he should say it or not. There is no reason why he would even think the question was about some reporter who approached him. He even looks uncomfortable when he gives the explanation, like he knows he is telling a lie.

This is just a few of the reasons I think it was a hoax. Everything just occurred so perfectly for it to not be. I am completely open to discussion, but I feel like a lot of people went in the emotional direction and not the logical one. 

(**ALSO NOTE:** I specifically didn't reference any shady dealings on the detectives part. I also didn't reference the guilty plea. As hoax or not, they kind of cancel each other out so that the situation does not change because of them).",changemyview
CMV: Voting isn't a civic duty; *informed* voting is. The US (and democracies in general) would be better off destygmatizing not voting.,37,jb4khh,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jb4khh/cmv_voting_isnt_a_civic_duty_informed_voting_is/,45,2020-10-15 00:56:52,"People often call voting a responsibility, carrying the implication that being a citizen and not voting is bad. I think this misses the point; to me, if voting is a responsibility, it is in the sense that it should only be done responsibly. Sure, the ideal democracy might be one in which every citizen took the time to inform themselves and voted based on their opinions and knowledge. But that seems unrealistic (though maybe that is some inner cynicism). So I take as an assumption that there is a portion of the population which I don’t think can be reasonably expected to inform themselves because they just don't really care. On that assumption, I think the world is better off with those who don't inform themselves just not voting than being pressured into voting by the whole 'civic duty' rhetoric.

Let me clarify a few things here. I don't support limiting voting access with testing or anything like that, which is a common thing with people who think similar to how I do about this. I don't think there is really a way to implement any sort of barrier that wouldn't add some bias to the system, and I don't think there's a reasonable way to test 'informedness', because I don't think there's really a quantitative way to define it. I'm arguing for a change in social rhetoric from ""everyone go out and VOTE"" to ""everyone who cares enough to inform yourself go out and VOTE"". With that social change, I think trusting people to judge their own level of informedness would at least be a lot closer to ideal than the current situation in which those who really don’t care are basically slandered. Particularly in light of the fact that voting required a non-negligible amount of effort on the part of a citizen (registering, showing up, waiting in line, etc), it seems reasonable to assume that in a world where citizens aren't made out as civic failures for not voting those who don’t care enough to inform themselves won't go through the effort.

I totally understand where the other side here too--that democracy is supposed to be a society where political power is held by the people. I have two responses to this.

First, how can we justify forcing people to vote? Not being interested in voicing a political will is a political opinion, and there are people who have it. Maybe it’s because there is no candidate that motivates them, or maybe it’s because they don’t care about politics at all. I personally disagree with both of those reasons, but it seems to me that telling those people to vote anyway seems like an attempted suppression of their political will. I know its not illegal, but still, the social pressure to vote seems pretty undemocratic to me here--isn't one of the whole points that people can express their political opinions their own way?

And second, if someone doesn't care enough to inform themself, their vote won't be cast based on their political ideals--it will be cast based on name recognition of candidates, or the ballot lines their friends like the most, or some other external factor. This seems like it could lead to a situation in which the winning party is the one which successfully badgers the most people who don’t care to vote, as opposed to the one who captures the majority of the people’s will. So an uninformed vote isn't just not democratically ideal--it seems explicitly undemocratic, in the sense that it could potentially affect an elected outcome that isn't a true representation of the majority democratic opinion.

I also know that voter turnout is pretty dismal, at least in the US. I agree that civic engagement is a huge problem, but I disagree vehemently that the solution is to verbally batter people for choosing not to vote for the reasons outlined above. I think a better solution would be to figure out ways to get people to care more about being an active part of their community, in which case it seems like voter turnout would follow. This seems like a very separate topic to me, and it’s not really a part of my CMV; I'm including it as a rebuttal to the counterargument that my CMV opinion is a slippery slope to an oligarchy, or at least an enabling of a problem. I think there is a way to destygmatize not voting while simultaneously increasing civic engagement, because I think that they are separate. Besides, there’s a mountain of evidence in education that negative consequences (like shaming) for failing to complete an act (like homework) serve only to drive students further from educational institutions; while I haven’t seen this principle applied directly to voting, it seems pretty darn analogous. And besides, as much of a problem as voter turnout is, trying to fix it by shaming uninformed voters into casting votes they don't believe in seems like an even further perversion of democracy to me.

To sum it up, I agree with Teddy Roosevelt: ""A vote is like a rifle; its usefulness depends on the character of the user."" By destygmatizing not voting, we can remove noise from the electoral system and achieve election results which better represent the will of the people.",changemyview
CMV: Drag-And-Drop Programming Generally Acts as a Waste of Time and Is Largely Unnecessary,35,jb4bs1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jb4bs1/cmv_draganddrop_programming_generally_acts_as_a/,26,2020-10-15 00:44:47,"There has been a rise in the past several years in the popularity of various forms of “low code”, which often come in the form of “drag-and-drop” languages. Two examples of these languages which I have worked with are Scratch and Alice 3. These systems created an enclosed environment in which the user can set a scene, place characters or “sprites”, and drag various pre-made functions into a main method in order to have the sprites do various complex actions. These systems are often used in education, as an “introduction to coding”.

My issue with these systems and their growing popularity is that it often feels as if they cause programming to be more complex and confusing, rather than simpler. This is because, instead of learning a special syntax of English, these systems require users to learn how to use a software and the often complicated user interface it entails.

These systems are even used at a college level sometimes, and I see no reason why they are a neccesary step before learning the basics of standard languages such as javascript, python, or any other easier to learn languages. While I understand the point is to build the “logic” which programmers use, this logic can be built much faster when the user is put into a real, industry-used environment where the possibilities can be endless.

Of course, many argue these systems can be useful when introducing coding to those in a k-8 or k-5 environment. I feel this creates a two-fold problem: 

One, it fails to generate interest in coding. Sure, you may teach a child how to make a character say some words or wave at the screen, but that is not the magic of computers. Far greater interest can be created (with similar ease of difficulty) by guiding children through things which they cannot do themselves, such as beginner cryptography, like brute-forcing a small password, or writing scripts to make life easier.

Two: I see no reason why a child cannot just as easily learn a real language, even if it is HTML. Khan Academy and CodeAcademy both have amazing courses on beginner programming with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and several other languages. These systems also explain how to use the languages outside of their environment, so the young programmer can actually make things which they want to make.

Yet, it seems as if these “simplified” programming languages are becoming more and more common. Is there any real benefit to this?",changemyview
"CMV: The “my body, my choice” slogan for pro-choice advocates does not benefit their position because opponents of it do not believe it’s just a woman’s body, but that it’s also a child’s life.",13647,jb2gut,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jb2gut/cmv_the_my_body_my_choice_slogan_for_prochoice/,3447,2020-10-14 23:10:01,"Some people believe life begins at conception. Some of those people believe ending any life after conception is murder. That is not my view. That is a pro-life view.

My view is that using the phrase “my body my choice” or suggesting that pro-life is about controlling women misses the point entirely. Pro-life people don’t just believe it’s “your body and your choice” because it’s not just your body, it’s the body and life of a child.

I do believe many pro-life and pro-choice people could be misogynistic, intentionally or unintentionally, but I don’t think that it’s necessarily misogynistic to be pro-life if you only believe that abortion is murder because life begins at conception.

Although, I am open to the possibility that there is some angle that makes this simple pro-life view hypocritical.

For the record I am pro-choice. This isn’t an argument about the merits of aborting unwanted babies, the morals of late term abortions, or the science behind when life begins. This is an argument about the intention behind the stance that abortion is murder and the value of the stance that pro-life is about controlling women.

Why do I think this?   
By 28 you are more likely to have a greater sense of how life works, be less naive and more intune with reality. I'm not saying all 28 year olds will have their life sorted out but I do think this is more likely around this age. You would have passed all host of other filters in life as well.   


By 70 or retirement age you are less likely to suffer from severe cognitive decline, be bitter at life for things you did or didn't do, have other health problems that may bias you. 

My point is, I want to get votes from folks who are the least bias they can be and serve the interest of the most people in an unbiased way.

CMV: America is almost certain to suffer a brain drain.,12,jax23c,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jax23c/cmv_america_is_almost_certain_to_suffer_a_brain/,50,2020-10-14 16:52:24,"To sightly expound on the title, I believe that given the current climate (meant in a number of different ways that I'll go into further down the line) in America, a brain drain effect will inevitably occur unless something radically shifts.

For those that are unaware, a brain drain is the emigration of highly skilled workers from a particular country. Perhaps the most common example was what happened in East Germany during the [Cold War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emigration_from_the_Eastern_Bloc#%22Brain_drain%22).

Now the reasons why I think this are; the ""re-rise"" of anti-intellectualism, the clamp down on immigration, poor socioeconomic development, and the political instability.

First up, the political instability. The vast, vast majority of people want safety and security in their lives. America does not offer that at the moment. Regardless of your views and the moral justifications, both the left and the right have been involving themselves in the escalation of a great deal of conflict, both physical and verbal. I am deliberately not taking a stand on the moral justification of either side here, as the reasoning behind this instability has nothing to do with the issue at hand.

When people find themselves in an unstable situation, they will often try to flee to a more stable [location](https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article/25/1/tay040/5056445#121562160).

Secondly, the immigration clamp down. Immigration is a great [boon](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/fr/how-immigrants-contribute-to-developing-countries-economies_5jfj2sg0970x.pdf%3FitemId%3D%252Fcontent%252Fpublication%252F9789264288737-en%26mimeType%3Dpdf&ved=2ahUKEwjt-tDI37HsAhXHQkEAHcrJBxsQFjAMegQIGhAC&usg=AOvVaw2lHRdQikJcJMIQNl0HjTM2) to developed nations (including the US). Without a suitable inflow of immigrants working as laborers, medical support staff, care assistants and so on, the infrastructure that supports the highly skilled roles will start to collapse (take a look at post-brexit Britain where the Prime Minister recently begged migrants to [return](https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/brexit-news/boris-johnson-wants-eu-workers-to-return-ahead-of-brexit-82346) ). As this system starts to collapse, the skilled workers will find themselves unemployed and start to look abroad for better opportunities.

This will be compounded by the third situation; poor socioeconomic development. Say what you will about America, but it's hard to deny that its poor have a rough go at it (at least when compared to other developed nations). From the lack of universal healthcare (which the US is the ONLY developed nation not to [have](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/jun/21/mark-pocan/universal-health-care-diagnosis-mark/) ) to the uncertainty you'll find in the [social security system](https://www.forbes.com/sites/catherineschnaubelt/2018/05/30/social-security-past-present-and-future/amp/). Again, high skilled workers can find themselves in an unfortunate situation (which happens all the time), and without suitable support in place they'll find it to be easier to up roots and move to somewhere with a far more secure system in place.

Finally, the ""re-rise"" of anti-intellectualism. Anti-intellectualism has been around for basically as long as there's been intellectuals (taking what happened with Galileo, the church, and the motion of the heavens as a well known example), but since the birth of civilization, progress of humanity has come when science, evidence, and logic have prevailed almost every time. Again, the issues here spring from both left and right (Trump spouts his insane conspiracy theories and anti-scientific crap, and the left has whatever the fuck ""Shut Down Stem"" is supposed to be promoting as well as events like [Evergreen](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-lesson-in-campus-consequences-11579134145) ) but the end result is one where those that could be pushing humanity ahead are instead getting death threats, and it's no surprise that they'll want to go somewhere more appreciative.

Now to be clear, I'm not saying that America will be the only one that will suffer a brain drain (I'm from the UK and personally I think we'll be suffering from it hard in the next few years), but it's also the most widely known situation, especially on Reddit. I also don't think it's inevitable (although great change would be required at this point in my view) or that it will necessarily be permanently crippling.",changemyview

The major characteristic of all dissociative phenomena involves a detachment from reality, rather than a loss of reality as in psychosis.[1][2][3][4]

Dissociation is commonly displayed on a continuum.[5] In mild cases, dissociation can be regarded as a coping mechanism or defense mechanisms in seeking to master, minimize or tolerate stress – including boredom or conflict.[6][7][8] At the nonpathological end of the continuum, dissociation describes common events such as daydreaming. Further along the continuum are non-pathological altered states of consciousness.[5][9][10]”

killing rape survivors is wrong and has always been wrong. 

A) In the Bible, Deuteronomy 22:22-29 it says that if man is found to be lying with a woman they are both to die. AA) How was this right to stone someone to death for that?

B) A man finds a betrothed virgin and lies with her. BA)  You shall in all cases when this happens as you are command to bring them both out of the city “and you shall stone them to death with stones” because “ the young woman because she did not cry out in the city” so she is being stoned to death for not cry out. BB) In some cases it will be sex (see AA)) but there are still the cases where it’s rape because she **wanted to** cry out but couldn't BC) because the man was gagging her, drugged her or because of psychological dissonance. BD) So she didn’t cry out and she is to be stoned to death for something acting upon her against her will. And the Bible says she is evil. BE) This is is victim blaming. Why is she evil for having something acted of upon her such as rape? 

C) a man comes across a “betrothed young woman” in the countryside and “forces her and lies with her” “then only the man who lay with her shall die” (see (F)). CA) And now that she is not a virgin she cannot marry anyone as in Deuteronomy 20:13-21 say that is a man finds that his wife is not a virgin, he should bring her to her father and as she was raped before she is not a virgin, so it is “shall stone her to death with stones”. CB) This means that marriage is out of the question. And back in them days it was marriage or a nun. CC) So she has no choice but to become a nun, This isn't a free choice so she has no free will. 

D) As you can see from (BC) no scream or a struggle doesn't mean it isn't rape. DA) 27 is saying that if they are in the countryside when the rape happens she is okay as there is no one to hear her scream. DB) She should be okay regardless of if she “cried out” as for what I said in (BC) being that she may be gagged, drugged or otherwise on incapable of screaming.

E) 28 If a man rapes a woman who is not betrothed and is found out, he is command by God’s breath to marry her and pay 50 shekels of silver to the father of the woman raped. EA) So the woman is forced to marry the person who raped her. EB) I can’t imagine what that must be like to marry to the person who raped me and what’s more have no grounds for divorce ever until I die. Can you?

F) in Exodus 20:13 it says you **“shall not kill”**. So the stoning people to death is killing them, someone or a group has to kill them in order for them to be stoned to death as ordered by Yahweh FA) this is in direct condition to the “you shall not kill” commandment. FB) This means that it is wrong to stone to people death. FC) But the Lord your God cannot do wrong. FD) So Which is it? Is stoning people to death a good moral action as God ordered you to do or is it not killing people that is a good moral action?

# Scripture 
## Exodus 20:13 
>shall not kill
## Deuteronomy 20:13-29
>13 “If any man takes a wife, and goes in to her, and detests her, 14 and charges her with shameful conduct, and brings a bad name on her, and says, ‘I took this woman, and when I came to her I found she was not a virgin,’ 15 then the father and mother of the young woman shall take and bring out the evidence of the young woman’s virginity to the elders of the city at the gate. 16 And the young woman’s father shall say to the elders, ‘I gave my daughter to this man as wife, and he detests her. 17 Now he has charged her with shameful conduct, saying, “I found your daughter was not a virgin,” and yet these are the evidences of my daughter’s virginity.’ And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city. 18 Then the elders of that city shall take that man and punish him; 19 and they shall fine him one hundred shekels of silver and give them to the father of the young woman, because he has brought a bad name on a virgin of Israel. And she shall be his wife; he cannot divorce her all his days.

> 20 “But if the thing is true, and evidences of virginity are not found for the young woman, 21 then they shall bring out the young woman to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones, because she has done a disgraceful thing in Israel, to play the harlot in her father’s house. So you shall \*put away the evil from among you.

> \* purge the evil person

> 22 “If a man is found lying with a woman married to a husband, then both of them shall die—the man that lay with the woman, and the woman; so you shall put away the evil from Israel.

> 22 “If a man is found lying with a woman married to a husband, then both of them shall die—the man that lay with the woman, and the woman; so you shall put away the evil from Israel.

>23 “If a young woman who is a virgin is betrothed to a husband, and a man finds her in the city and lies with her, 24 then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them to death with stones, the young woman because she did not cry out in the city, and the man because he humbled his neighbor’s wife; so you shall put away the evil from among you.

> 25 “But if a man finds a betrothed young woman in the countryside, and the man forces her and lies with her, then only the man who lay with her shall die. 26 But you shall do nothing to the young woman; there is in the young woman no sin deserving of death, for just as when a man rises against his neighbor and kills him, even so is this matter. 27 For he found her in the countryside, and the betrothed young woman cried out, but there was no one to save her.

>28 “If a man finds a young woman who is a virgin, who is not betrothed, and he seizes her and lies with her, and they are found out, 29 then the man who lay with her shall give to the young woman’s father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife because he has humbled her; he shall not be permitted to divorce her all his days.

# Summary 
So in Summary (A) looks at two consenting adults having sex but being stoned to death because of it. And how did Yahweh thought that this was a good idea just stoning people to death for having **consensual** sex 

In (B) we looked at how not all people cry out when being raped and how stoning someone for not crying out is unjust and is just stoning innocent people for actions taken out of their control.

 In (C) we talked about how 20:17 only allows virgins to marry, excluded any rape survivors from being married this will deprive them of a family, love and giving them the only option of becoming a nun as it was in them times. 

With (D) shows just because they didn't cry out doesn't mean that them not crying out is them enjoying it or they want it. As shown by psychological dissonance.

(E) brings us onto why rape survivors shouldn't be forced to marry the rapist.
In (F) you shall not kill and you shall stone people to death. Which one is right and which is wrong as they both mutually exclusive.

# Conclusion
So at some point Yahweh thought it was a good idea to kill raped survivors. God being the definition of morality, so anything God does is moral so therefore it's moral to kill rape survivors. Even if you say that Jesus changed it. It was still at one point moral to kill rape survivors.

So how can Yahweh be a good moral agent if he condones the killing of rape survivors?  Or how can the killing of rape survivors be a good moral action?",changemyview

I approached by saying, “Hi, I just saw you and had to share my awesome mood.” Her eyes lit up. She liked me instantly. Then, for the next minute or two, I proceeded to spit “good game” at her, saying witty, “cool” lines that would supposedly get her even more attracted to me. (I had been taking an online course about how to talk to women.) But with every passing second, I could feel her interest diminish. The “cooler” and wittier I was, the less relatable I was, and the less she liked me. After a couple minutes, she said, “It was nice meeting you,” which is code for, “Not interested.” Ouch. 

I was trying so hard to “attract” her that I repelled her. Instead, I should have simply connected with her. 

Do a Google or YouTube search for terms like “attraction secrets” or “how to talk to girls” and you’ll see thousands of tips purporting to teach guys how to “attract” women. Be alpha. Be mysterious. Be cocky. Be funny. And on and on.

Men should stop trying to “attract” women. Women are already attracted to us, just as we’re attracted to them. Attraction is handled by Mother Nature, the ultimate wing-woman. As Homo sapiens, we’ve been attracting each other for 200,000 years. Early Man didn’t need clever lines from Youtube. 

You don’t need to “attract” women. They’re already attracted, just as you’re already attracted to them. (If Scarlett Johansson approached you, how good would her “game” have to be?) 

When a guy focuses too much on trying to attract, he hurts himself in two key ways 1: He comes across as a try-hard guy straining to impress her, which makes him less attractive. 2: He’s not focused on what women really want: connection. 

We’re all wired to seek romantic connection. It’s a fact of evolution. But unlike attraction, romantic connection is not instant or automatic. It takes time and effort. You have to both like some of the same things, or share emotional experiences. So, a guy on a date who focuses on “be attractive” is failing to focus on the most important thing to do on a date. 

He’s like the Hulk with a handgun. It’s overkill. Women already find him attractive. They want connection, not attraction. (Watch any episode of “The Bachelor,” and almost every woman will say, “We had the most amazing connection!”)

If you try to “attract” women, you’ll repel them. But if you try to connect, you’ll attract them.

Columbus was picked during a time of historical revisionism as a significant Italian figure in the history of the United States. It is debatable whether he is actually even Italian and while his values were typical for the majority of the planet at the time, people now question whether people with those values should be celebrated.

My argument is that the original intent of the day was to honor the impact of a group of oppressed immigrants which is important and should be expanded to celebrate all immigrant groups. We should not get rid of the whole concept of honoring immigrants because the symbol of the day was deeply flawed.

&#x200B;

Italian Americans as an ethnic group are no longer systemically oppressed in America our struggle should still be honored. Culturally Italians are still often depicted negatively so there is a small amount of cultural oppression that gets blown out of control by conservative Italians. For those who don't know, Italians were very oppressed in the 1800s and the first half of the 1900s. The KKK regularly targeted Italians and the largest mass lynching in the history of America was perpetrated one 100% Italian American men.

My point is that the struggles of immigrant populations and the cultural contributions should be honored while also educating people on the horrors of the genocide against the indigenous people of this land. This is the inclusive and healing move for our country. This would allow Italians to continue their tradition on the existing holiday and prevent further dividing our already deeply divided country.

Additionally, I would say thanksgiving, which is also problematic, is much more in line with the spirit of what we should be honoring indigenous people for.

CMV: Most humans actively argue for society to kill them,0,jal1ia,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jal1ia/cmv_most_humans_actively_argue_for_society_to/,19,2020-10-14 03:54:00,"I believe that due to our nature, we are pre-programmed to prefer easy solutions to our problems even at the cost of other humans. While in old times, people were pretty open about thinking this way, today, we pretend to have evolved beyond that way of thinking. However:

A lot of people agree with the idea of putting certain people to death that they consider to be monsters:

Child abusers, Murderers, Rapists, Terrorists, ""illuminati"" and a lot of others come to mind right away.

But let's look into these categories to see how big they actually are:

Child abuse comes in a lot of forms:

There is psychological abuse which is hard to either qualify and quantify but often still leaves permanent marks on a child's psyche. I think it's reasonable to assume that a lot of people would find the more extreme cases of that to be punishable by death too.

The, there is physical abuse: It starts at once losing control towards your child and beating it. I feel like very few people would consider that a crime worth punishing by death but if it happens more than just a very few times on accident, a lot of people would once again say that violence against children needs to be stopped at all costs and that killing the people who do these things is not completely unjustified.

And then, there is sexual abuse: Pretty much everyone agrees with the idea that someone who rapes a small child should be put to death or locked away permanently if that is an option. This is often applied also to all pedophiles (even if they take active measures to keep themselves from ever hurting children) and a lot of ""creeps"" and ""perverts"" who supposedly threaten children in one way or another. Some argue that just being open with your own children about nudity and sexuality is already sexual abuse. Others argue that shaming kids into being afraid of their own body is at least sexualised abuse.

With murderers, we have a different issue: If we start collectively killing the worst criminals, that also makes us murderers ourselves. We can call it war and justify it by there being too many dangerous people to lock them all away but even with just those whose actions towards children are generally condemned to be death-worthy while we keep making excuses for why we still give most of those people another chance because in reality, everytime we lose control in the presence of children because we were traumatized ourselves, we are actively hurting children.

And it's true on all other levels too:

People who kill someone in self-defense are still often seen as murderer by those who believe that the death of the aggressor could have been avoided or just believe in a totally different story about what happened.

And defining rape as pressuring or physically forcing someone into sexual actions against their will: It happens a lot in relationships and settings where people get drunk. A lot of it is argued away because of circumstances that made both sides lose control of the situation.

Most ""terrorists"" are just people who live in oppression and try to fight for their freedom and we've established a definition of terrorism that includes everyone who is working with the ones who use violence or even just works towards the same agenda with peaceful means. Lots of peaceful politicians are nowadays considered ""practically terrorists"".

And about the ""illuminati"": As opposed to the newest version of antisemitic myths, the illuminati actually was a secret organisation within the enlightenment movement that wanted to change the world by educating people. They also unsuccessfully tried to infiltrate the government to work towards that purpose and 2 years after they had been criminalized due to pressure from a much stronger secret society, people started to assume that they secretly started the french revolution because that would have aligned with their ideas which happened to be very popular at that time and which did lead to the creation of our modern society. If you believe in education, you're a person who believes in illuminating society on what was formerly information privileged to the rich and therefore you are part of the illuminati. There is no secret clubhouse or anything, it's just an idea.

And then, there's women who think all men should just be killed while a lot of men want to save society by killing feminists or muslims or whatever.

We all consider ourselves to be mostly tolerant because as we keep saying that what actually attributes to almost all of our race needs to be killed, we imagine ""them"" to be just a small number of people but in reality, we're really becoming increasingly judgemental and i feel like if this doesn't change, it will end in us all killing each other.

So, here comes my main point:

If there was a vote about whether to make the world a better place by killing everyone who doesn't fulfill a standard that we consider reasonable but actually includes 99.9% of humanity, the same 99.9% would collectively agree while believing that they only vote to get rid of a very small, very toxic minority of people.",changemyview
cmv: The Separation of church and state does not mean that morals can't be religiously sourced,2200,jakrtn,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jakrtn/cmv_the_separation_of_church_and_state_does_not/,607,2020-10-14 03:40:39,"The argument I make more specifically is that the separation of church and state means that an individual who is a government leader can't also be a religious leader at the same time. This does not mean that any moral that comes from a religion or religious text can't be used in politics or that a voter is required to provide a non-religious reason for their moral opinion and the way they vote.

The reason I say this is this; we try to separate politics and religion in our heads which is difficult, because politics is in large part deciding what should and shouldn't be punished based on morals and what's good for society, and religion is where many people get their ideas of what is right and wrong. For example, if India has many laws reflecting Hindu values but their government leadership is not participating in religious leadership roles at the same time, I don't see anything wrong with that. The majority of India holds certain values, they all vote and those values affect law, and the law reflects the religious ideas of the majority of it's citizens. The government is still ran by its citizens, not by a church,   and this government is still not amorally influenced by a church, just all of its voting citizens. Indian citizens shouldn't be required to show you where they got a moral from to show that it's not influenced by Hinduism and therefore a valid opinion to have.

Lets say that it is illegal to eat a cow in India and someone could say to a Indian ""Your opinion is affected by your religion so it has no place in politics and shouldn't affect your vote"". Then the Indian believer says ""actually I'm not religious, I just believe that it is wrong to kill and eat cows"". Then what? His opinion is now worth more because it came from a different source?

For background, I am a Christian and I make this argument because it is common to hear ""you can't let that belief affect your vote and it should have no place in politics because it came from the bible"". I often think to myself ""well then fine, lets say I'm an atheist. I don't believe in God and this moral opinion I have is a result of some atheistic moral feeling or abstract reasoning, and doesn't come from a religious text. Is it valid then?"". I think all morals aren't from science because there's nothing scientific about assigning value to human life or wanting to alleviate someone else's pain. Morals are things we take from our religion, upbringing, and a voice from inside us, and we are entitled to our opinion no matter where it came from (I suppose if you consider climate change a ""moral"" issue then there is an exception and probably a few others).

I do understand as well that if the majority of a nation thinks a way that I don't, then I should know that they determine the policy, and I agreed to a democratic government and in turn agree to the laws elected by it. I will vote the way I will and if I'm not the majority, they won fair and square and that's the way it is.

"CMV: Golang is just C with some syntax sugar, and is a sham so that system programmers don't learn new design patterns",9,jak9b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jak9b8/cmv_golang_is_just_c_with_some_syntax_sugar_and/,16,2020-10-14 03:15:09,"I love programming languages. I learn new programming languages because they teach me new design patterns, new ways to structure my program, and even new ways to design a solution, new paradigms.

To improve a system programming language, one important way is to employ new design patterns, and new paradigms.

* JavaScript ES6 set the standard for asynchronous programming, using a Monadic design similar to how Haskell handles I/O operations.
* Rust prevents resource leaks using the `Drop` trait, following the RAII pattern, similar to C++ smart pointers.

But when I learnt Golang, which is said to be the competition for Rust, I was shocked at the horrible design choices behind this language. Compared to all the new languages like Scala and Rust, Golang does a horrible job at enabling good design patterns.

* Golang doesn't have RAII or `with` statements. Instead, programmers must remember to manually add a deferred function call: `defer cleanup()`, which is basically `goto cleanup_label;` in C. Hopefully you'll remember every time.
* Golang doesn't have classes, and must rely on functional programming. Yet it doesn't provide Generics, which highly limits the ability of functional programming. Golang's response? Either, explicitly write out multiple copies of the same code, one for each type; Or, use the ""empty interface"", which is just another name for the very unsafe `void*` pointers in C.
   * If Golang's goal is to go against functional programming and to adopt a simpler version of OOP, I am very eager to learn how it all ties together. Usually this can be achieved with [Trait-based programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_(computer_programming)), a simplified version of Java's Interfaces. But Golang messed that up, too. Golang's interfaces are too simplified. [It's incredible hard to design a Map-Reduce function.](https://medium.com/@BastianRob/implementing-reduce-in-go-4a3e6e3affc)
* Golang doesn't have a well thought-out syntax for asynchronous programming, which has proven itself to be very efficient for Web Apps. Although it provides Goroutines, it doesn't provide a way to flexibly compose Goroutines together. Any modern functional programming language will provide a way to program higher-order functions, to simplify the code and design while allowing for performance benefits. Golang couldn't, because its type system can't begin to understand a Generic type (see previous point) that represents a function.

Therefore, I say Golang is nothing more than C with some syntax sugar. I even suspect that it is a sham so that system programmers don't have to learn new design patterns.

As a zealot programmer with a passion in rooting Android phones and tweaking kernels, I am sad to see the very people who develop these innovations are so unwilling to learn new design patterns. If they truly cared, they would have invested in a language like Rust, Haskell, or at least, C++.",changemyview
"CMV: Stormfront was miscast (The Boys, season 2 spoilers)",0,jajfic,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/jajfic/cmv_stormfront_was_miscast_the_boys_season_2/,54,2020-10-14 02:34:32,"I want to preface this by saying that I don't think Aya Cash did a bad job in her role just that for reasons that are best to be delicate when talking about, she doesn't fit it.

So, for all those who've watched season 2 of The Boys, we know that the character Stormfront is actually a Nazi. No not just a fascist, or racist but an honest to god member of the Nazi party back in its heyday, the wife of a bona fide Nazi scientist and is seen in pictures posing with Himmler, Goebbels and the Fuhrer Hitler himself.

Furthermore, in her long life, Stormfront has far from abandoned her racist ideals, casually executing, collaterally killing and racially abusing people of any ethnicity other than white. She's even part of the plot to make an army of white supersoldaten to exterminate other people's, all the while under the delusion of white genocide and that her actions are some kind of ethnic self defense. That's a whole lot of nasty.

The only problem is that her actress, Aya Cash is, well, very visibly Jewish. Or rather of Jewish heritage. If we're being hyper exact, of Semitic heritage since it's not her, or her family's faith that I'm talking about.

It was very distracting for me as well as somewhat immersion breaking. I spent so much of the series wondering, thinking there were answers behind it. How did a Jewish woman marry a Nazi? How was she accepted as a member of the Nazi party? She took photos with Hitler himself, photos that were not erased or anything so clearly, for some reason, Hitler was fine with being in pictures with her; why? Could it be that the Nazis of this world were greatly different to the real world? Accepting of Jews? If so, why do characters act the same way towards them as real people would? Is she a Jewish woman pretending to be a Nazi? If so, how did nobody notice her obvious Semitic heritage? Why is she of all people talking about being the _victim_ of white genocide? It was all so confusing and distracting.

I thought I'd get some answers to this perplexing mystery at some point but even when she's dying on the floor, she's muttering in German and trying to salute. What? Apparently, I was supposed to, I don't know, not notice that she was Semitic, at least according to people I've talked to, and I was supposed to just believe she was actually a white supremacist.

Now I've heard some counters to my complaint and I will attempt to preempt some here.

""Taika Waititi played Hitler and he's Jewish."" He absolutely did. Keegan Michael Key often plays a white dude in some of his skits. It's a comedy, not really a drama. You're not meant to laugh at the Boys the same way you're meant to for a Monty Python sketch. Satirical though it may be, the Boys has been trying to tell an overall serious story with a few jokes within.

""Just suspend your disbelief, God."" I didn't know I was meant to. There have been many mysteries in the show, questions that remain unanswered that it's fun to speculate about. What reason would I have to think this wasn't like any other; a mystery that would be revealed but that I could mull over in the mean time. There's also another thing I'd like to mention called verisimilitude or internal consistency. I am an avid reader of fantasy so I have no trouble suspending my disbelief for things that don't match reality. So long as the world you create is consistent with _itself._ Yet in the Boy's universe, the Nazis seem to just as reviled as they are in reality, just as white supremacist and just as all around bad, presumably with the same views towards Jewish people. It doesn't just defy the reality of Nazi Germany that a Jewish woman ascended to that height of power, it defies _this_ world's logic that it happened too.

And by _FAR_ the most common response, easily making 9/10s of replies; ""Huh, I didn't even notice she wasn't just a white woman."" To this, all I can say is that it was fairly obvious to me and, as anecdotal as it is to say it, to all of my friends who I watched it with.

I've heard people ask incredulously ""how much does that really distract you or take from your engagement?"" And that's fair. So how about a comparison. Imagine a drama set in a pre civil rights, all white school. And there's a character, a side character, who's in the school and they're played by a black actor. And nobody _ever_ brings it up. People act like this very obviously black character is in an all white school and it's completely normal. All the while, this character played by a black guy is saying shit about how black people shouldn't mix in, and calling them negroes and the like without even a hint of acknowledgement by them or any other character that they were black themselves. Would you not also be perplexed? Wondering if perhaps some form of unreliable narrator thing was being used? Would it not take your attention away from other things in the plot?

I'm not faulting Aya herself. Her performance was perfectly fine and I presume that, had I not spent every second she was on screen scrutinising her origin and speculating about what was _actually_ going on, I would have found it engaging. So, go ahead, change my view. I'm not staunch on this so I'm open to change.

Edit; please see the two deltas I've given before replying. It's possible someone's said what you're thinking and I've already conceded to it. Cheers.",changemyview

She can’t lose her job based on the way that she rules. Therefore in my opinion there is no conflict of interest. Also, if Barrett recuses herself that would mean the possibility of a 4-4 vote.

While, it is certainly up to debate whether or not the US credit score is impacted by any security camera footage, and I'm leaning on ""No, the only factors are raw financials"", there is definitely substantial proof that minorities are discriminated against via the credit score system in the US.

An immediate example is that your credit score will absolutely tank for speaking out against the government in China whereas that doesn't appear to be the case for the US. That said, the US is dangerously approaching that territory under the current administration. Additionally, in China, speaking out against the government could put you on a list to be subject to a manhunt.

**They're flexible**

There are an infinite number of ways to cook a potato. Cut it into bits and fry it up with some eggs! Bake it and fill it with cheese and butter! If you're a little nauseous, just boil it and eat it plain! The flavor is mellow enough that it's easy to stomach if your nausea isn't severe. There are so many possibilities!

**They're easy**

This is a subcategory of the potato's flexibility. Hangovers can result in a lot of aches and fatigue, meaning you don't really wanna try as hard on breakfast. Potatoes are simple to boil. They can take a good half hour to cook through depending on the size, but this can also be a benefit: you could start boiling one before your nausea wears off, and have a fresh, hot potato ready the second you need it.

**They're everywhere** 

Potatoes are inexpensive and readily available in pretty much every part of the world. There are yummier hangover foods, but these can be regional, more expensive, or otherwise harder to obtain. Eg, a bagel egg and cheese sandwich is my go-to when I'm in NYC. Bagels are way nastier in pretty much every part of the world. Buying a sandwich from a shop is an issue if I feel too gross to leave the house. Finally, that's a good $5 for that sandwich. Compare this to the simple, honest potato. They're available no matter where you are, they're easy to cook at home, and you probably already have some on hand since they're incredibly cheap.

**They're really healthy**

A major cause of the fatigue from hangovers (other than dehydration) is a depletion in vitamins, particularly electrolytes. Potatoes have electrolytes in their peels, and are packed with vitamins throughout as well. On top of that, they are of course loaded with carbohydrates, which energize you. They can literally help cure your hangover, in a small way. Compare this to say, eggs and bacon, which is mostly protein and fat.

**They're so satisfying**

There's something warming about a potato. It fills your whole body with comfort and contentedness. A dash of butter, a sprinkle of onion powder, maybe a little shredded cheddar cheese. The steamy, mellow scent filling your nose. It's just a delight.

**Tl;dr - potatoes are the best hangover food because there's many ways to prepare them, they're easy to prepare, they're easy to get, they're healthy, and they're great comfort food.**

*All that said,* if a better hangover food exists, I have GOT to know about it. So prove me wrong, I dare you!",changemyview

I'd suspect that English-language media simply calls them ""feminine"" because they simply associate gender-agnostic beauty such as smooth skin, long eyelashes, beautiful hair, and symmetric facial features with ""femininity"" because in the Anglosphere males are known to put very little effort into their appearance compared to many other cultures—[bishōnen](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/02/52/f8/0252f8ed61411803d3ed373f6e2cc145.jpg) characters however quintessentially:

a) I didn't ""choose"" to be here and now, the game of survival was forced upon me.  
b) The instinct towards survival is made redundant by me living in an environment where survival is hardly ever a concern. (In the modern world one rarely finds themself in a life-threatening scenario)

It received an absolutely massive pr boost through western media, Reddit being a forerunner with posts about Hong Kong reaching some of the highest karma counts on the site. Of course, what the CCP has done to many of these protesters is wrong, breaking their arms, sending in tanks, all of the sort. However, the HK protests are perceived as peaceful, and they are not, many buildings have been destroyed, and there are numerous videos showing them grouping up and beating people who do not agree with them (im not making this up go look) Also, most HKers want to keep the one state two systems rule. I am for democracy, and I don't particularly care about burning buildings, but a similar scenario is happening in the U.S. right now, and yet we are divided on this issue.

The Uighur camps are certainly a bad thing that have no direct U.S. counterpart. I know I certainly wouldn't want my culture erased and me to be ideologically indoctrinated, and within the last twenty years, this has not happened to that extent in the U.S. However, misinformation is vast about this event, many of the famous pictures that you see concerning it are not pictures of these camps, and there is little to no evidence that Uighurs are being actively killed on a genocidal scale. Many people will cite correctly that forced labor is used in these camps, the EXACT SAME THING happens in the United States, which is indeed a bad thing, but it is entirely hypocritical to condemn one without the other. And frankly, the argument that China is ANYWHERE NEAR as bad as Nazi Germany is bullshit.

More on the muslim note, within the past twenty years we KNOW that the U.S. has unjustly invaded Muslim countries in a response to terrorism, killing far more than the Chinese currently have, millions of middle eastern muslims were killed less than twenty years ago, and yet the U.S. tries to claim moral superiority?

The Chinese imperialism one is easily the most laughable, comparatively no military bases, far less economic imperialism, and few if any coups on Chinas part. Compared to the rampant imperialism of the U.S.

The reality is that what China is doing is fucked up, and I will INSTANTLY change my stance if sufficient evidence comes up about Uighurs being killed on that scale, I am not a demagogue. But at the same time reddit and hundreds of millions of Americans are falling into the propaganda trap of this second cold war. I am not saying that the U.S. is currently less moral than China, but I hear far too much about them being Nazi's or fascists for me to stay silent. It is a dangerous narrative pushed by people who see active benefit in China's downfall.

This is my view, I am responsive to changing info, perhaps I do not have the sources you do. I used to be vehemently anti China, so my opinion can be changed.",changemyview

Sean Hannity, for instance, told The New York Times in August 2016 that he has “never claimed to be a journalist,” a position that he affirmed on Twitter in October 2016 when he tweeted that he’s a “talk host” and “not a journalist.” Hannity’s employer, Fox News, agreed, noting on November 15, 2017 that, “Shep \[Smith\] is an outstanding journalist, and Sean \[Hannity\] is an outstanding opinion commentator.” But, more recently, Sean Hannity has claimed to be a journalist,  a move that is significant because it's shifting Hannity from the terrain of pseudo news into the realm of fake news. While pseudo news is often misinterpreted by audiences as legitimate journalism, it does not attempt to pass itself off as such. Fake news , by contrast, deliberately seeks to mislead consumers; it intentionally masquerades as news for the expressed purpose of manipulating people.

But none compare to Kareem's skyhook. It's basically magical to watch it. For one, it's just a thing of beauty and I dont know why other tall players dont use it now. It's unstoppable. But even outside the sheer beauty, it was so dominant, it was the essence of Kareem, it won championships. It's not like Kareem was a very athletic guy. he was a weird stick. but that skyhook. Obviously, it was key to his holding the points record, and key to his teams being so dominant. So i guess my key contentions are: (1) the skyhook is so so pretty, (2) it was so dominant, (3) it was fundamentally difficult to achieve and is a high-skill shot, (4) perfecting it transformed an average shooter into a virtuoso, (5) it's totally iconic, (6) it was key to Kareem's dominance and legacy as a player and the Lakers history. (idk, some of those bleed into the others, but you get my point).

There are other great shots, like the eurostep from Parker/Ginobili, the Reggie Miller or Steph Curry three, the Jordan fade away, the Shaq dunk (im not saying shaq invented the dunk, but his ability to dominate the dunk was his signature shot), Id even be willing to add Magic's no-look pass (even though it's not a shot). but nothing matches the Skyhook.

CMV: It would serve the Progressive goals better if Biden were to lose the election to Trump,0,ja2v1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ja2v1h/cmv_it_would_serve_the_progressive_goals_better/,79,2020-10-13 08:19:25,"I am starting from two propositions: US elections are cyclical and Biden is a poor candidate.

In the last 50 years a Republican candidate always followed a Democratic candidate and vice versa with only two exceptions: Nixon->Ford (but he was not elected but rather served out the continuation of Nixon turn) and Reagan->Bush (but Reagan was a very popular president). At 77, Biden is just too old to run for the second term. He is also extremely prone to gaffes, and if he wins, for the next four years Fox News will be repeating his mis-speakings ad nauseum. As an example in a recent meeting with voters he called America's most popular rifle AR-14, called the voter ""full of shit"" and offered to ""take it outside"". Or during the debate he said that ""150 million of Americans died from gun violence"" since Bernie voted on PLCAA. The probability that Democrats will get 8 or more years if Biden wins is essentially zero.

Also, I think Biden's government will be very weak. He is an extremely unexciting candidate - I live in Seattle - Democratic bastion - and I counted less then 10 Biden-Harris signs, including cars. There was far, far more pro-Hillary signs, and there are certainly far more pro-Trump signs around Seattle. Which means that Democrats will probably not turn Senate, and even if they did, it would be only by a small minority, not enough to really change anything.

On top of it, Biden isn't even promising to change much. He explicitly runs as an establishment candidate whose chief position is not to anger billionaire donors. And these donors - from both parties - are super interested in preservation of status quo.

So based on this I don't see much or really any progress on progressive agenda - healthcare, climate change, taxation - and what little will be made will immediately fall to Republican administration in 2024 - which is very likely to last for 8 years - if not blocked before that by Republican Supreme Court.

By the way, speaking of Supreme Court. It is unlikely that there will be retirements in the next 4 years, but in the 8 years after that? Almost certainly. So whoever holds power then will have - just like Trump - an outsized influence in SCOTUS. And if Biden wins now, it would be Republicans.

If Trump were to win, however, I can see Democratic landslide in 2025, including supermajorities in Senate and House, enough to hold the next 8 years of presidency and implement things that Democrats claim they want. But for that Biden needs to lose now.

I think there is a time and a place for everything. 

I saw a lot of posts for mental health awareness day where people would post a selfie, identifying information, and then give a summary of all their trauma and mental health challenges. First of all, that's dangerous. You shouldn't give everyone such intimate information about yourself. 

Second of all, something about it strikes me as inappropriate. When I was in the grips of my mental illness I talked to anybody and everybody about it because I was trying so hard to escape I didn't care what I had to expose to get help. But it made a lot of people uncomfortable. 

I also could sense there was something wrong with casually telling a group of people at a party you got gang raped (my friend did this when we were getting drunk) but I still can't name exactly what is wrong with it but in her presence it felt like we were taking part in this violation. This information is extremely intimate and private and our encroachment was unwilling.     

I have had mental health challenges and trauma too. There are ways to tactfully gloss over it in a professional setting or with people you don't know well. However, I am uncomfortable with the fact that it's becoming more casual.

 It used to be that you would divulge this information to people you trusted and had a strong bond with. Telling them would usually still carry some risk but you could reasonably expect them to respond with love and effort. Them accepting and comforting you would be a reciprocal act of love. Strangers are not close enough to you to carry out these tasks, nor are they usually close enough for you to feel comfortable with it if they were to try.

Destigmatizing mental health, addiction, sexual assault, and trauma, doesn't mean we tell everyone about our most personal struggles and greatest faults. It doesn't mean we pretend these issues are just as impersonal as physical health like getting a stubbed toe. It means we as a society do not blame or judge people for experiencing these things.",changemyview

It’s used by (generally) white, western, emigrants moving to another country. There is no need for this word other than to set those who label themselves as expats apart from those termed “immigrants”.

Why do they set themselves apart? Because there is a stigma attached to the term “immigrant”. It is seen as a negative, and assumptions of taking advantage of a host country for personal benefit, a view not attached to the term “expat”. 

However, fundamentally, use of the term “expat” worsens the negative view of the term “immigrant” by extolling an “us and them” attitude. If all migrants used the term “immigrant”, including, for example, white, western migrants, the term immigrant would at least partially lose some of its stigma.",changemyview

It feels like the casual usage of the term, and its clearly-defined intention is maybe more damaging to white working-class culture than we give it, and diminished some of the very real, very difficult social problems that it implies. It presumes sovereignty over situational hardship and diminishes the institutional issues that need to be dealt with to solve them. Hilary Clinton's whole 'Deplorable' thing a few years back shined a light on the issue and I think there's an inherent relationship between the implied disposability of the people in area from the term white trash itself.

A human instinctively shuns pain and discomfort and, because of our unwillingness to undergo them, is prone to anger and indignation at those who inflict those upon him if he does not deserve it. But how do we know when we deserve it or not? This is when reason, memory, and logic play its role. If a person punches me in my face for no reason, perception tells me that that hurts and was uncomfortable, then reason tells me that I did not deserve that and makes me indignant at this. Driven by both sense and reason, I will naturally seek redress, which constitutes justice. However, suppose I am in a boxing match and my opponent punched me in my face. In this situation, the perception component is the same, but reason tells me that it is justified and within the bounds of morality. Not all inflicting of discomfort, therefore, is immoral, since it may be, depending on the context, reason, and situation, justified. Inflicting pain or discomfort on another person for punishment is justified and the person being punished knows he has no right to seek redress and he deserved it. Hence, justice seems to have two components: sense and reason, emotion and logic, personal feelings and societal notions on appropriateness.

Justice — the seeking of redress or even revenge on those who hurt us unjustifiably — forms the baseline of morality. Justice serves as a regulatory and equalizing role in human society: it ensures that those who are hurt, oppressed, offended, insulted, or made uncomfortable unjustifiably in any other form can restore the equilibrium by in turn seeking an apology, a redress or punishing the offender. Deterred by punishment, the offender will eventually learn that what he did is immoral and will no longer engage in this. Hence, this regulatory and balancing force will solidify itself and become what we know as morality or a code of conduct in society. As human society progresses, this code of conduct will become more and more concrete and codified, and will be taught by parenting, schooling, religion, etc. This is the origin of justice and morality: the push and pull between offense and punishment, until an equilibrium is restored and people are deterred from disrupting this equilibrium forever.",changemyview

In particular, I'm in favor of single payer healthcare, universal basic income, free public education from pre-K through college, significantly increased investment in public infrastructure (highways, bridges, public transportation, nationwide broadband etc.), significantly increased investment in green energy, stronger environments regulations, campaign finance reform, a major overhaul of the criminal justice system, stronger protections for civil rights and voting rights, a stronger social safety net, and expanded services for those who are experiencing poverty, homelessness, disability, illness, or addiction.

CMV: Super Mario Sunshine is a badly designed game.,3,j9sxn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j9sxn2/cmv_super_mario_sunshine_is_a_badly_designed_game/,20,2020-10-12 23:27:15,"I recently bought Super Mario 3D All-Stars. Of the three games included, Super Mario Sunshine is the only one I had never played before, so I was excited to get into it. I was aware it was a controversial entry in the franchise, but thought it was just a case of rabid fans getting angry whenever a sequel isn't exactly the same as the original.

After completing (but not 100%ing) the game, my overall reaction is that the detractors were right. Super Mario Sunshine is a slapped-together mess that fails to meet the standards of Nintendo or the Mario series. A vast amount of the game feels rushed, untested, or purposely designed to frustrate the player.

Mario Sunshine is a difficult game, but unlike other famously ""Nintendo Hard"" games, none of the difficulty feels earned. Instead of creating better challenges, it makes simple tasks into slogs, and builds levels where everything takes twice as long as it needs to. Some examples:

The Swinging Pirate Ships: The swinging ship ride in Pinna Park is central to several Shine Sprite challenges. The ships are big platforms that swing back and forth, and make a full rotation every three swings. Why do they do this? Seemingly for no reason other than to make the player wait for something important to happen. It adds nothing but time. To me, this is the most perfect illustration of Sunshine's design philosophy.

The Yoshi Boats: In this game, Yoshi disintegrates whenever he touches water. To get one Shine in Delfino Plaza, you have to ride Yoshi across three slow-moving boats to a small island. Each attempt takes about 15 minutes, and if you fall in the water, you have to start again. Like the pirate ships, the ""challenge"" here comes not from skill, but from how long you're willing to sit and do nothing.

The Pachinko Machine: This infamous level requires Mario to gather coins from an enormous Pachinko machine with nonsensical physics. To succeed, you don't need reflexes, timing, or critical thinking -- just the patience to fight against Mario's sluggish momentum to get where you need to go.

The Corona Mountain Boat: Another well-known sticking point. You have to steer a boat using bizarre, partially inverted controls. The challenge isn't steering well, but fighting against your own instincts to stick to the unintuitive control scheme. If the boat was easier to steer, they could have added more interesting obstacles, but no such luck.

The Boxing Glove in Noki Bay That Just Hucks You Into The Water: This doesn't even hurt you. It just forces you to repeat the exact same platforming segment you just finished. Yet again, instead of making the challenges better, Sunshine just makes them take longer.

I could go on forever, but every example is on the same theme. Whether it's the controls, the camera, or the environment, you're always fighting against the game to get to the interesting parts. And I haven't even mentioned how easy it is to fall through the floor to your death in several of the levels.

Beating a level in a good platforming game always feels like finishing a marathon. You're exhausted, but also exhilarated at having overcome a difficult challenge. Getting a Shine in Super Mario Sunshine feels more like running a mile or two with lead weights tied to your ankles. It might burn the same number of calories, but the marathon challenges your skill and ambition, while the lead weights challenge your ability to withstand frustration.

It's a real shame, because there are a lot of things about Sunshine that I like. The tropical setting feels cohesive and lived-in, and I like how each level has its own mini-arc. The hover nozzle is a great idea in theory. Cleaning goop with FLUDD is satisfying. I even like the blue coins, since they encourage you to explore nooks and crannies. But none of those things can make up for the gameplay, controls, and level design dragging the experience down at every turn.

Yet lots of people seem to love Sunshine. My cousin, who's a professional game designer, even said it's his favorite 3D Mario game. So I'm open to being convinced that it's either a) a well-constructed game that just isn't for me, or b) a great game that I should give another chance.

tl;dr After finishing the game, I think Super Mario Sunshine is a shoddy, hastily-built mess, but I'm open to giving it another shot if someone can CMV.",changemyview

CMV: Transgender people prove that gender essentialism is at least partly true.,746,j9r8l0,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j9r8l0/cmv_transgender_people_prove_that_gender/,388,2020-10-12 21:51:02,"First and foremost, I want to be clear that I fully support the rights of transgendered people (and all people) to live life in whatever ways makes them the happiest. I am and will continue to be friends with trans people, I happily refer to them (and anyone else) however it is that they prefer to be referred to, refuse to vote for anyone who opposes their rights, and otherwise hold that they are human beings who are deserving of dignity and respect. In short, I am not just some sort of bigot transphobe who finds the topic uncomfortable and responds by projecting this discomfort onto other people. I love everyone who isn’t purposely a jerk.

If you want to know my ‘angle’ with all of this, it is that I identify as having an innate gender, and find the idea that gender is purely a social construct to be both factually incorrect and also dismissive of my experience (and the experience of many other people).

I can’t, however, get away from the notion that transgendered people inherently prove that some aspects of gender/sex essentialism are true.

The prevailing theory regarding gender is (as I understand it) that gender is just a series of social functions which we have arbitrarily (or even exploitatively) lumped together and assigned to a particular sex.

If this were really the case, then transgendered people should not exist. There should merely be people who want to engage in certain behaviors. Yet Transgendered people do not claim that they merely want to wear specific clothing, nor do they claim that they merely want to engage in certain social roles. Transgendered people claim that they feel like their innate sense of self does not match their physiology (and I believe them 100%). If we grant that these people are correct (as we should), then we must concede that people have an innate identification with a specific category of reproductive physiology and our identification as such is not socially constructed. Put another way, if there is no such thing as an innate identification with a certain reproductive physiology, no one would want to transition physically.

I know that trans issues are simultaneously a sensitive topic, and also one which has been beaten to death. I will write this out formally, so that people can discredit my individual premises or otherwise argue that my conclusions don’t follow from them to (hopefully) make this more productive and streamlined.

Premise 1. Gender is a social construct and has nothing to do with anything innate or physiological.

Premise 2. Transgendered people innately identify with different reproductive physiology than they possess.

Premise 3. Premises 1 and 2 contradict each other.

Conclusion. Either gender is innate, and not a social construct, or transgendered people (and all people) are not innately a member of any gender.

Some answers to anticipated questions and objections:

I am not particularly interested in debating about the definition of terms. I will define some terms here purely for the purpose of communication. The point is the concepts the words represent, not the specific words I happen to have chosen. If you disagree with my terms, that is fine. Please feel free to replace the terms I use with others (or even purely symbolic representations like 1, 2, 3, X, Y, Z, etc...). Please limit definitional objections to the definitions themselves. For example, I am interested if someone has an argument that there is no such thing a group of people who produce viable sperm, not whether or not that s really what a Male is.

I would say that among Humans, there are broadly three sex categories:

Males, who (assuming their body is healthy, uninjured, not developmentally disordered, and who have not undergone any kind of medical procedures which disrupt reproductive function) produce sperm which can fertilize an egg.

Females, who (assuming their body is healthy, uninjured, not developmentally disordered, and who have not undergone any kind of medical procedures which disrupt reproductive function) produce eggs which can be fertilized by sperm.

Intersex, who exhibit some combination of Male and Female reproductive anatomy which varies in form and functioning from individual to individual. Intersex people who can produce and release viable sperm may count as Male AND Intersex. Intersex people who can produce viable eggs and carry them to term may count as Female AND Intersex. Intersex people who can produce both viable eggs and sperm may qualify for all three categories (and would be quite amazing!).

Sex is not something which is assigned, but is something innate. No one produces sperm or eggs because a doctor checked a certain box on a form when they were born.

Gender, on the other hand, is an innate identification with a sex. People can fall into three broad gender categories:

Cisgendered, people who innately identify with the reproductive physiology they were born with.

Transgendered, people who innately identify with reproductive physiology they were not born with.

Genderqueer, people who do not particularly identify with any reproductive physiology, or people who vary in the reproductive physiology they identify with and the degree to which they identify with it.

Gender *is* assigned at birth based on sex, but this is a mistaken assumption and causes lots of problems for transgendered people.

I DO believe that SOME gender **ROLES** are *mostly* socially constructed. The fact that we assume boys will like blue, girls will like pink, that women wear dresses but not men, etc. is arbitrary. These ideas have no basis in physiology are have nothing to do with anything innate. On the other hand, the fact that we associate roles which are heavily mediated by sexual dimorphism are not purely a social construct, but rather a combination of social constructs AND innate ***average*** physiological differences. So associating childbirth with women is not purely a social construct, and associating jobs which require a lot of innate physical size and prowess such as fighting with men is not purely a social construct. Not to say that there are no men who are interested in childbirth (such as male OB-GYNs) and no women who are interesting in fighting (such as female MMA fighters).

I also know that not all people who identify as transgendered desire to physically transition. In my terminology, such people would not really be transgendered. Since, for example, wearing dresses and makeup is not anything inherent, a Male sexed person who desires to present themselves by wearing a dress and makeup would be just that: a person who like wearing dresses and makeup. The fact that drag queens are not necessarily transgendered proves this point.

Again, I don’t mean to come off as claiming that I am some sort of linguistic authority. I don’t think I should be able to tell anyone else what terms they use for themselves. I am not interested in semantic debates, and understand that words mean different things in different contexts. I am not trying to ‘claim’ or ‘reclaim’ terms in some sort of culture war. I am just trying to accurately describe concepts and apply the most universally understood terms in current use such that we can all understand what we are talking about. Maybe someday Male and Female will mean something completely different to people than is does today, but there will always be groups of Human beings who produce viable eggs and viable sperm.

CMV: Infinity Wards Call of Duty characters don’t have any real depth,1,j9lpfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j9lpfv/cmv_infinity_wards_call_of_duty_characters_dont/,9,2020-10-12 14:22:28,"Spoilers ahead for any number of call of duty games. Just in case.

So as the title says, let’s get into it. Infinity Ward’s call of duty characters are terrible. They are absolutely so forgettable it’s not even funny. None of them have any real depth to them. Let’s go through some of the more popular ones

Price: this dude is the most popular character in their franchise and you know what the most memorable thing about him is? His mustache and hat. In other words, the fact that he deviates even slightly away from the stereotypical image of a special forces operator. He has virtually NO character growth across FOUR games as one of the most recognized characters, if not THE most recognized, of not only Infinity Wards arc but the franchise as a whole. The most recent game did the most to fix that and even then it goes to one of the most stereotypical tropes possible. The antihero who does what needs to be done contrasted to whoever the guy you play as can’t remember his name. Heck probably the most humane part of this character is when Soap dies and he FINALLY reacts with somewhat convincing emotions and it lasts for a whopping 2 minutes before going right back to the old boring Price. 

Ghost: Another really popular character, this dudes entire thing is that he has a skull ski mask (I’m sensing a pattern here). That’s it. Besides him being upset when the person you’re playing as is killed (ooo another pattern), I can’t remember a single moment with him.

Soap: I’ll give them some props with soap, changing him from a mute playable character to someone I actually enjoy looking at? His transition from rookie to team lead is probably some of the biggest growth in the series. The downfall? IT ALL HAPPENS OFF SCREEN. We go from rookie to commander but we don’t see any of it and have to fill it in with our minds which is probably why it’s the only decent size of character growth in this series.

Makarov: this dudes boring af. Stereotypical Russian boogeyman terrorist who actually somewhat succeeds being the only good part about his character which even then isn’t truly about his character development, just an action he takes

Farrah: I like farrahs character actually. It’s very stereotypical but to have the “noble ‘terrorist’” at least makes it somewhat different. Again, still relatively stereotypical but ah well.

And off the top of my head, those are the only character I remember. And most are pretty boring. I don’t know if it’s the writing, the voice acting, or the setting limiting it but the characters are so boring. Contrast this with Mason from black ops, woods, Reznov, even the robot from the fucking space game and infinity wards characters are just terrible. CMV",changemyview

"CMV: The argument that 'the word ""homosexuality"" did not appear in a Bible translation until 1946' is irrelevant",18,j9li34,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j9li34/cmv_the_argument_that_the_word_homosexuality_did/,28,2020-10-12 14:04:42,"First, I am not a Christian - just a secular person interested in the issue of translation, and fascinated with religion as an outside observer.

[This blog post](https://www.forgeonline.org/blog/2019/3/8/what-about-romans-124-27) does a good job summarizing the basic argument I have seen online. Basically, the claim is that the word ""homosexual"" did not appear in a Bible translation until 1946 when it was added to the RSV translation. This is trivially true. However, it explicitly and implicitly makes the case that this was the first time that broad anti-LGBT language appeared in a Bible translation which I want to say is wrong.

I think this argument is wrong-headed on a few basic points:

**Specific Words and Translation**

The following statement is true:

> The word ""God"" did not appear in a English translation of the entire Bible until the 1300s with the publication of the Wycliffe Bible.

Now, does this statement mean that Wycliffe added the concept of God to the Bible? No, it only narrowly means that the specific English word ""God"" did not appear in a complete Bible translation until the 1300's. The Hebrew, Greek and Latin texts that later translations would be based on all had concepts more or less corresponding to our word ""God"" in them.

The word ""homosexual"" was [not coined until 1892](https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=homosexual), so regardless of whether anti-gay sentiments are authentically in the source texts for the Bible or not, it is no more surprising that the word was not used in translations before this date than the non-appearance of the words ""God"" in pre-Middle English translations of the Bible.

**Older Translations With Anti-Gay Translations**

The author of the blog post claims that he collected Bibles in many European languages, and all of them clearly condemned pedophilia not homosexuality until that fateful 1946 translation into English. Now, I've only studied French, Spanish and Esperanto and would only call myself fluent in one of them, but I think I know enough to distinguish ""young boy"" from ""man"" or ""male"" in a verse, so let's take a look:

> **French (Louis Segond - 1910)** Lévitique 18:22 Tu ne coucheras point avec un **homme (man)** comme on couche avec une femme. C'est une abomination

> **Spanish (Reina-Valera - 1909)** Levítico 18:22 No te echarás con **varón (male, man)** como con mujer: es abominación.

> **English (KJV - 1611)** Leviticus 18:22 Thou shalt not lie with mankinde, as with womankinde: it is abomination

> **Esperanto (Londona Biblio - 1926)** Levidoj 18:22 Kaj kun **virseksulo (male)** ne kuŝu, kiel oni kuŝas kun virino: tio estas abomenaĵo.

Now all of these are pre-1946 across four languages and none of them say ""young boy."" This seems to be decent evidence that a pedophilia interpretation was not widespread among European languages prior to 1946.

**Are the Leviticus Verses Anti-gay?**

This is the heart of the issue for me. To this I don't have a good answer - while I have read many books on religious studies, comparative religion, the historical development of Christianity, etc. I am not conversant in Koine Greek, Hebrew or Latin.

I can say that the modern concept of sexual orientation did not exist in ancient Jewish or Greek culture. The concept of to adult men of equal age and social standing with stable male-only attraction just wasn't a thing then - which means that the idea that any Biblical text would condemn anything exactly like modern homosexuality is a bit anachronistic.

However, I think that basic points stand:

* Whether Leviticus 18:22 is actually anti-gay or not, the idea that it condemns homosexual behavior, and not pedophilia seems to be pretty old.
* The 1946 date is not as much of a landmark as it is made out to be.
* It seems dishonest to take older German translations, which seem to be unique in  condemning sex with young boys, and not males or men in these verses.

I think there is also a larger point that even though ancient Biblical sexual mores are different from modern ""puritan"" sexual mores, my general impression of Biblical sexual mores on the whole is that they are not permissive or ""sex positive."" Even if modern LGBT concepts are no where touched upon or condemned in the Bible, the attitude of the book towards sex outside of marriage is not a generally permissive one.",changemyview
"CMV: Assuming You Have Access To Internet, There Are No Good Reasons To Get Cable Television",286,j9fuv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j9fuv3/cmv_assuming_you_have_access_to_internet_there/,92,2020-10-12 07:25:24,"I just did the math. For roughly $75.00 a month, I am able to gain access to Netflix Premium, HBO Max, Disney +, Hulu (No Ads), ESPN +, Amazon Prime, and The Criterion Collection. Again, only $75.00 a month. My monthly fee for a service like DirecTV would be $65.00 a month, but it would increase to $97.00 a month after the first year. I should point out that this is their most basic package. If I were to purchase a cable television bundle from my current internet provider, the cost would be the exact same. In summary, basic cable television will cost you roughly $20.00 to $25.00 more each month, and that's only in comparison to someone paying for all the streaming services I listed above. It could potentially cost you a lot more if you decide to pay for less services.

On top of that, cable television currently has no compelling original shows worth watching. I looked up what the best shows of the past decade were. Rolling Stones has a list of fifty shows, and only four of them are not available through one of the streaming services I listed above. Only four. It's basically a fact that quality programming is found on streaming platforms. Cable television just can't compete anymore. And this is only addressing episodic series. When it comes to movies, streaming is a no-brainer. 

So what reasons would there be to get cable television? What reasons would there be to drop nearly $100.00 each month on this program? Cable news is obsolete, since I can get easy access to all news stories online. If you still really want cable news, then spend a $10.00 one time fee on an antenna. That's what my parents did. That just leaves sports. My parents have been able to access professional soccer, football, and basketball through their antenna, but let's say you want an even broader selection of sports. Just get Hulu + Live TV for $54.99 a month. Add in Netflix Premium, Amazon Prime, and HBO Max for a bundle that is still the same cost as a basic cable television package, only with absurdly more content.

In conclusion, streaming offers more variety, better content, and is cheaper than cable television. There are some programs streaming doesn't necessarily offer, but which can be easily accessed through alternative methods that are still cheaper than cable television (Hulu + Live TV, antennas).",changemyview

First off, just watch any full highlight video of Ronaldo, then watch Messi. In Ronaldo’s, dude obviously has such a better skill set. He can literally do everything. His touch and juggling skills show his dedication to fulfilling his full potential and ability of tricks and whatnot, and he actually uses them effectively in games. He’s faster, bigger, and stronger than Messi while already having a blatantly better dribbling ability. Also, when one thinks about “the ideal soccer player” it would be someone who can do it all, the tricks, assisting, headers, bicycle kicks, long range goals, knuckleball free kicks, etc. Ronaldo is the only player I can think of who can do all of these things. Also, whenever the Ronaldo-Messi arguments come up, it always comes down to “Well Messi has more titles than Ronaldo” but that’s not the point. I think it’s pretty fair to say Argentina has a better all around team than Portugal, so that’s not Ronaldo’s fault his team doesn’t do as well on the international level compared to Argentina. Since the debate is about who is the better PLAYER, it should reflect skills, speed, technical ability, headers, strength, etc. Yes, I could agree that Messi might be just quicker and agile than Ronaldo, but all Messi does is run get through teams fast. Yes, it’s effective, and he doesn’t NEED to do anything else if it works. But does that justify him as “the best to ever do it”? No way. I think the only reason everyone obsesses over Messi is because other greats have brought his name up, but that’s because his style only looks good to older players. Watch Messi play nowadays, he doesn’t/can’t really do much. The new generation of players are all becoming much more technically better than older generations of players (I know this may not be true but I feel it’s pretty obvious) that messi’s “dribble around everyone” bullshit won’t work anymore. And then you look at Cristiano, who THESE DAYS is doing fucking bicycle kicks and headers 8 feet up in the air, it’s because he is the BETTER PLAYER. It’s really that obvious. And yes, Ronaldo hasn’t been playing at his best either but I just think most Messi fans naturally love the superficial, maradona-esque view towards football, that Messi is some “god given gift” and that’s why everyone acts like he’s the chosen one. In reality, ya Messi is a fucking outstanding player and one of the greatest the game has ever seen, but to think he’s able to do more as a soccer player than Ronaldo is just ignorant.

Modern technology means there is no real reason to continue making blockbuster movies the way Hollywood does now. AI is quite capable of writing screenplays, and can do this much more efficiently than humans. Bots can be programmed to write according to a formula that is known to be commercially successful i.e. runtime = XXmins, action scenes = YY%, etc.

Even if you doubt the quality of computer-written scripts, a blended approach would still be much more efficient: computers could churn out screenplays which are then reviewed and revised by humans before being approved. 

Once we have a screenplay (by whatever method) there’s no reason to cast a host of big-name stars, shoot on-location or to create expensive sets and props. CGI is so realistic and good now that all of the above is redundant. Speaking back to my first point, in theory AI could do the end-to-end process... writing and ‘filming’ an entire movie in a matter of hours with minimal human intervention. 

Imagine the cost-savings with the above. No more expensive production overheads. No massive crews and casts... just a few editors and programmers. No need to pay the big-name stars $20m each for their part. All of this could be passed onto the consumer, which could potentially revive an ailing industry. 

I accept there’s a counter-argument to say some people are attracted to films specifically *because* the big-name star is in it. However, I don’t think this alone is a good enough reason to maintain the status quo. Hollywood stars could be phased out, for example by being reduced to providing the voice for the animated characters, before being made totally obsolete. Some consumers would be early-adopters of the new norm and not miss the “big-name stars,” whereas for others behaviour could be effectively changed within one or two generations. 

I do believe there’s a place for smaller independent production companies though, who offer a tangibly different customer proposition to that coming out of ‘mainstream’ Hollywood.",changemyview

There is no definition such that it would include all individuals that are women and exclude all those who are not in a systematic and meaningful way.

 I'll work just with women for the sake of brevity here, but I think this goes for both existing sex categories. 

I'll also provide some examples of definitions that simply don't work or are incompatible t with a view of two clean-cut immutable biological categories. Therefore. **changing my view would mean either showing how one of these definitions works, or proposing one that would.**

###**Bad Definition 1: A woman is someone who can bear children over their lifetime**

So this easily false on account of infertile women. If this is the definition, infertile women are not women. To argue that they *could've hypothetically* had children had it not been for whatever condition made them infertile is poor categorization, as anyone *could've hypothetically* bore children had their bodies been fundamentally different. 

###**Bad Definition 2: A woman is someone who has XX chromosomes**

[Androgen Insensitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_insensitivity_syndrome) comes into play here. Some individuals with XY chromosomes do not respond to male hormones, causing developmental changes. [These Women](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Orchids01.JPG/1024px-Orchids01.JPG) all have some manner of intersex conditions, they all live as women, they were raised as women, they have secondary female sex characteristics and several of them have female primary sex characteristics, but they have XY, or XXY chromosomes. 

Most women do not know their chromosomes, so it is entirely likely that you have met or run accross an XY woman and thought nothing more than ""a woman"". [Some XX individuals also have a completely male phenotype.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XX_male_syndrome).

###**Bad Definition 3: A woman is someone who has ""female genitalia"" (vulva, vagina, ovaries etc.)**

As you probably know, male and female genitalia are homologous, they are made from the same fetal tissue and are differentiated by hormonal signals during gestation. The biggest problem is that while some genitalia are easily differentiated, there are multiple ambiguous and mixed cases, casting doubt into there being a clean line between them. Individuals are born with ambiguous genitalia display features and tissues associated with both common forms and hormonal differences during development can ""masculinize"" or ""feminize' genitalia. [Some examples are discussed in this article](https://www.nature.com/news/sex-redefined-1.16943). 

Many individual's genitals were created in surgery shortly after birth (sex determination surgery). Many individual's genitals are morphologically and functionally changed by environmental factors such as injury or developmental factors like the ones mentioned above. People can have a vagina and testes. People can have a penis and ovaries. People can have both ovarian and testicular tissue. Many of these individuals look like, live like, were raised as women, in effect *are* women.

Since genitalia doesn't come in just two forms, that means that a sex categorization system based on genitalia would have to include more than two sexes.

###**Bad Definition 4: A woman is someone who has female secondary sex characteristics (breasts, wide hips, etc.)**

Easy, secondary sex characteristics are determined in puberty. Any individual may, in effect, end up having a full set of either secondary sex characteristics. People that undergo hormone replacement therapy  have secondary sex characteristics of their desired gender. 

---

Before I address your responses, I'd like to touch on a common point: 

### **Common objection: Intersex people are ""mistakes"" so it doesn't count.**

This is not an objective stance. ""Mistakes"" and ""errors"" are only possible within a frame of intention, and the forces of nature do not ""intend"" for anything to be one way or another, things just are. To say that a human feature is a ""mistake"" implies that there is an ""ideal"" or ""intended"" human, when I think you'd be hard pressed to explicitly define what such an individual might be like. Natural selection does not operate around platonic ideals, those tend to be projection by an individual of what they are accustomed to.

Even features that decrease individual odds of survival or fertility cannot objectively be classified as a mistake. For example, humans developed menopause which lowered individual's fertility but increased the number of available child carers in social groups, increasing the groups infant survival. Group selection and kin selection standards are much harder to define and observe, so it can be hard to determine whether a trait improves the group's survival odds or not.

**""Mistakes"" do not exist in nature, and to say otherwise humanizes nature and evolution in a way that is neither provable nor objective.**

A  carpenter who fixes up their own house and earns the money back by selling the house at a higher price than they bought it for, pays less in taxes than if the carpenter did the same work and earned the same money as wages. Although not as clearly parallel the same sort of thing holds true of all investment. If you spend time researching investment and so make a profit, you will pay lower taxes than if you were paid to do the research.
* Your work is of no value to society. Some jobs pay well, but they only serve to gain money for either you or for administrators and corporate executives. Thus, when you work, you're increasing the gap between rich and poor. Other jobs are of value to society but are low paying. If you take these jobs, you decrease the wages of those who must work. Often the profits from these jobs are skimmed off by administrators and corporate executives, leading either to a wash or a net loss to society. If you don't do the job, someone else will. They probably need the job more than you do.",changemyview

I understand the utility curve and how the more money you have, the less impact the additional dollar has. However, I'm not arguing against a progressive tax system. Yes, the rich should pay more than others. However, if voters want ambitious, costly programs like medicare for all, free college education, UBI, etc., then the 99% will need to have to pay more taxes as well.

People commonly point to the Scandinavian countries as models the US should follow. Putting aside the fact that they have 1/35th the population of the USA (and therefore easier to implement social programs), another big reason is they have high tax rates for all their citizens. 

For example, in Denmark, the top personal tax rate is 55.9 percent for all income over 1.3x average income. From the American perspective, this means that all income over $65,000 (1.3 times the average U.S. income of about $50,000) would be taxed at 55.9 percent. The same person making the same amount in the USA pays \~20% federal income tax. That's almost 200% more in taxes for the average American. I have a hard time seeing even the most US liberal voter base support anything remotely close to this.

Therefore, if politicians want to propose these social programs, then they need to increase taxes on ALL Americans, not just the rich. 

&#x200B;

Largely based on the below. Also interesting to read that if the USA were to follow the Scandinavian model, they would actually lower the corporate tax rates while raising income taxes.

CMV: There are three sexual orientations. Asexuality isn't a spectrum or sexual orientation.,0,j996wq,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j996wq/cmv_there_are_three_sexual_orientations/,61,2020-10-12 01:09:59,"As an asexual person, it really irks me that every possible article I find on the internet describes asexuality as a sexual orientation and as a spectrum of several identities. 

Sexual orientation defines which sex you experience sexual attraction towards. If it's the opposite sex, you're heterosexual, if it's the same sex, you're homosexual, and if it's both sexes, you're bisexual. It's very simple. Three options and three options only. Pansexuality, omnisexuality, polysexuality, or whatever multisexual variant out there is just bisexuality for people who believe there are more than two genders. I won't get into that mess since that's not what I'm posting about.

Not experiencing sexual attraction means you lack sexual orientation entirely, since you don't experience sexual attraction towards anyone. It's like atheism. In order to have a religious affiliation, you must have religious beliefs/practices. If you don't, you're atheist, nonreligious, secular, etc. If you don't experience sexual attraction to any sex since you don't experience sexual attraction at all, you're asexual, nonsexual, etc. 

If someone were to ask you what your sexual orientation is, you respond with ""asexual"" or ""I don't have one"" to signify that you don't have a sexual orientation, just like how if someone were to ask you what your religious affiliation is, you would respond with ""atheist"" or ""I don't have one"" to signify you don't have a religious affiliation. Just because you answer ""asexual"" doesn't mean asexual is your sexual orientation.

In terms of asexuality being a spectrum, it's absolutely ridiculous that people actually believe this and it's embarrassingly unfortunate that people explain asexuality this way. Asexuality is a lack of sexual attraction. So how in any way could that be a spectrum?  People would argue that asexuality is experiencing little to no sexual attraction, but ""little"" is subjective unless we place a number on how many times a person has to experience sexual attraction to no longer be considered asexual, which is impossible since everyone wouldn't be able to come to a consensus.

Some people who would say that since some people experience sexual attraction so rarely, infrequently, or under specific circumstances, that they feel more connected to the asexual community then to the straight, gay, or bi communities. But, it's like saying a really feminine guy who feels more connected with women than men can now call himself a women.

All of these ""asexual spectrum"" identities aren't asexual since you're experiencing some or specific kinds of sexual attraction. Back to atheism, if you have some religious beliefs/practices, you aren't an atheist, you're now spiritual or whatever terms there are out there.

Let's go through some major ""asexual spectrum"" identities. 

""Graysexuality"" is very vague since everyone defines it differently. Some people say rarely experiencing attraction, some say occasionally, some say infrequently, but have two problems with this: 1) How many times can a person experience sexual attraction and still be ""graysexual"", or considered ""asexual spectrum"". And 2) This is assuming that sexual people experience sexual attraction frequently, when most sexual people experience it occasionally and most sexual people experience times in their life where it is rarely. 

Then there's ""demisexual"", which is only experiencing sexual attraction to someone after forming an emotional bond. Where do I start? For one, sexual orientation defines who you experience sexual attraction towards, not how much or under which circumstances. With that in mind, both ""demi"" and ""gray"" sexual identities simply don't exist or make any sense, but we'll continue. With ""demisexual"", I have the same problem, how many times can a person experience sexual attraction and still be ""demisexual"", or considered ""asexual spectrum""? Some people can form emotional bonds with people easily and regularly, yet can call themselves ""demisexual"" and claim membership with the asexual community even though they can experience sexual attraction regularly, while I haven't experienced it at all.

I could go through the myriad of others: fraysexual, lithsexual/akoisexual, WTFsexual/quoisexual, cupiosexual, pothisexual, apothisexual, placiosexual, lamvanosexual, reciprosexual, aegosexual, requiessexual, acefluid, acespike, aceflux, and SO many freaking more. I'm not lying, search it up, it's ridiculous how many terms we have in the ace community to describe sexual orientation, even though all of the crap I just listed don't exist or make any sense. These ""identities"" along with the split attraction model, and all the identities that come out of there, makes everything super difficult for sexual people who are trying to understand the ace community.

I know some people will say it doesn't affect you, so who cares, stop gatekeeping, etc. But here's the thing: every time someone finds out I'm asexual, they either have all these preconceived ideas that asexuality is a sexual orientation and a spectrum, and I have to try and de-confuse them, or they automatically assume I believe all these things and call me an SJW even though I'm conservative.

And with the gatekeeping thing, why is gatekeeping such a bad thing? It prevents stupid ideas, terms, and labels from entering the community. The LGBT+ community gatekeeps ""pedosexual"" people, which I would hope no one disagrees with, but who knows. Not only that, but by preventing all these identities from being part of the community, people can begin to better understand asexuality and makes it easier for everyone.

I don't deny that these feelings don't exist. Yes, some people do experience sexual attraction rarely or only after forming an emotional bond, but that doesn't mean you're now graysexual or demisexual, or that you are asexual or ""asexual spectrum""",changemyview
CMV: There are regions where you should not be allowed to have large green-grass lawns,4423,j9901t,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j9901t/cmv_there_are_regions_where_you_should_not_be/,284,2020-10-12 00:59:31,"In general, I find  monolithic grass lawns unaesthetic, and poor use of land, but there have been other CMV posts engaging with the labor, and aesthetic  part of it, so I want to discuss a specific, environmental component. And for disclosure, I am an environmental scientist, so educated, but also possibily biased on this topic.

I accept that many people have aesthetic or practical reasons for wanting grass lawns, and there will always be a component of personal control over their land. And that there are regions where it can be minimally impactful. 

But when I fly over Arizona for example and see vast expanses of green lawns in the middle of the dessert (and don't get me started on golf courses), I can't help but think that its a selfish travesty.  In a region with severe water scarcity issues only getting worse, to think that people decide to put in large lawns of plants that would never thrive there naturally. Because fundamentally these are decisions  that impact everyone in a community, not just you, from [https://new.azwater.gov](https://new.azwater.gov)

""The largest use of potable water in Arizona is for landscaping and as much as 70 percent of residential water use is outdoors. "" 

And in addition to the water use,benefits there is of course the damage done to delicate desert ecosystems which are among the slowest to recover. I frankly just don't see how the possible benifts of having a lawn (recreation, aesthetics, etc ) outweigh these negatives. I know there are some initiatives in AZ to encourage people to take out grass and put in turf/native plants ([https://www.glendaleaz.com/live/city\_services/water\_services/water\_conservation\_and\_sustainable\_living/landscape\_rebate](https://www.glendaleaz.com/live/city_services/water_services/water_conservation_and_sustainable_living/landscape_rebate)). But I don't think that goes far enough. I think if you really want a lawn to layout on, or whatever you should be allowed to have something like a 25'x25' patch, and that's it. Maybe if you really want more you can pay a heavy tax or a much higher water rate for lawn needs that goes to water management/conservation but I know those policies can be difficult in practice. And to those who will accuse gov overreach, I don't see a significant difference between this and other building codes designed to protect natural resources, like having to get permission to cut down certain trees, or not being allowed to destroy wetlands on your property.

Or for another example, I personally live in a coastal, storm-prone area. And native plants are a very important part of buffering storm surges. So I think I am understandably angry when I see waterfront properties with coastal veg removed and big lawns in their place. This quite directly impacts the security of my home. And then of course the indirect impacats. like all the fertilzer needed to grow a big lawn on sandy ground unsuited to which in turn goes into the bay and leads to algaeo blooms and fish kills from excess nitrogen loading. This is an instance where I strongly belive that if you decide that you want to have waterfront property that you take on the resposibility for stewarding that vital interface, and should not be allowed to replace it with a lawn. And for properties that are already lawns I think they should have to pay an addittional fee for coastal management, but should also be able to recieve susidies for converting to more sustainable sollutions. And if you decide that a big lawn is that central to your well being and identity, live somewhere else where a lawn makes sense! Same way you dont move to Southern Florida and get mad when you cant have a basement.

I can think of plenty of other examples from Southern California, to South Africa, where lawn watering is a signifcant uneccesay use in drought prone areas. As you can probably tell I feel strongly about this, but I'm always looking to get other perspectives, to help find compromises.",changemyview

A lot of people will say ""X has been out for years so you should have seen it by now"" as if art has an expiration date. I don't agree with this because if I watched every movie that sounds interesting to me starting from the 1920s up til now I could never see everything before it hits its expiration. 

The ending of The Planet of the Apes (original) blew my damn mind when I saw it as a kid. I had no idea what was going to happen. That movie had already been out for decades at that point so of someone had ruined it for me because ""I should have watched it already"" then I think they would have been in the wrong. 

I know people are excited about whatever show they're binging but its not feasible to watch or read everything in a timely manner to avoid having things spoiled. 

If I'm talking to someone about a movie or tv show I'll ask if they've seen it before getting into details. There has just been so many times when I've said ""I haven't seen that yet and I don't want to know anything"" only to be told exactly what I just said I don't want to know. I don't get why people do this. 

The other thing is people saying ""This won't ruin anything"" and then telling me something that's maybe not the ending but just some other plot point or detail. I don't get why ""I don't want to know anything"" means ""please tell me what happens"" to some people.

So you may see a poll that says Biden is polling at 48% and Trump at 45%. Looks like Biden is in the lead right? Wrong. The MOE is 3%, which means they are statistically tied.

My belief is that displaying one number for each candidate is incredibly misleading, and leads people who have little knowledge about statistics to believe things that are untrue. If the entire point of polling is to get a snapshot of where candidates are at, they should be as accurate as possible. 

In my example above, I think the poll should include the MOE in the main number and be displayed like this:

* Biden: 45% - 51%
* Trump: 42% - 48%

This still makes it clear that there is no obvious leader according to this poll. Biden could be ahead, they could be tied, or Trump could be ahead.

By that I mean any kind exclusive rights being sold to any one platform.

This includes:

* Exclusive broadcast rights for a tv-show or movie being sold to a tv-station or subscription service

* Platforms buying exclusive broadcast rights for sport events

* Gaming systems (PlayStation, Xbox) or distribution services (Steam, Epic) buying exclusive publishing rights.

The reason is that exclusivity agreements are fundamentally anti-consumer and exist solely to force people into buying or subscribing to a certain platform by creating a local mini-monopoly surrounding that product. 

If you are a fan of a certain sports team and a subscription service bought the exclusive broadcasting rights for all games played by that team, but offers overpriced, shitty service, you can't just buy an equivalent but better service elsewhere, because what is being sold is in itself uniue. I would thus argue that exclusivity agreements go against the principles of the free market and should be considered a malicious practice. 

For clarification, I don't demand that the rights to every product should always be sold to every platform.

Many games developed for PC would be difficult if not downright impossible to translate to platforms without keyboard and mouse. Meanwhile other games might take advantage of the unique features of a certain platform, or the developer might just not be interested in doing the extra work needed to convert their game to other platforms. 

Some providers might not be interested in offering some shows or movies, or might not be willing or able to afford the prices demanded by the studio.

First off, sorry, if the title is not sufficient for the post, and for any grammar/spelling mistakes.

So, it's a bit more complicated:

I'm not vaccinated. I've received basic vaccinations while I was a baby, and got one or two more around the age of 6 years, but since then, I've never been vaccinated.

I have not cared about this for a long time, only when I got much older.  
We had a physics teacher who was very vocal about homeopathy and anti-vaxxers, and I genuinely believed what he said, since it seemed only logical.

Up until then, I had never talked with my parents about this, it simply did not matter to me, but after those lessons, I started to view my parents as the typical stupid anti-vaxxers.

I've started many discussion with them, and only then did I learn that they weren't against vaccines because ""it causes autism"" or any of that stuff that most anti-vaxxers say about vaccines, but rather because my mother almost died when she received a vaccine when she was a child, because she had an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients.

Since then, I've been very confused. On one hand, I want to think that vaccines are a great resource to humanity, saving thousands if not millions of people from dying because of common sicknesses, but on the other hand, it just seems stupid to me, that there are no tests to ensure you won't have an allergic reaction to any of the ingredients.

I feel like vaccines are being glorified too much and people are not actually aware of the risks that vaccines can possess. You're supposed to glorify them too, and if you don't (at least from what I've seen on reddit), people will absolutely go off on you/anti-vaxxers

You only have to do these set of tests once successfully and all you have to do is renew your license every couple of years afterwards with no retesting required. It seems people don't realize that our bodies and lifestyles can change at a moment's notice, and what their state of mind/body was last year isn't going to be the same as this year. People go to the doctor's office every year to get tested for diseases because they're in an age bracket or medical condition that puts them at risk. People have to get certified every 3 years to get a license to serve alcoholic drinks. People have to get certified every 2-3 years to perform standard first aid on someone. Why isn't there a re-certification program for drivers who operate a motorized vehicle that can literally kill/injure someone in an instant? 

Another reform I would like to see is the way the justice system sentences drivers of motorized vehicles. For me, I'm more a believer of rehabilitation than punishment. For instance, the drunk driver who killed a family friend of mine a few years back lost his job a month before the tragedy. The judge at the time sentenced him for only 2 years in prison because of time served in jail, which most would say is a slap on the wrist. However, what's worse was that there was no program set for him in prison to get himself back on his feet.  He's going to be jobless when he leaves prison and no one is going to hire someone with a record, so he's on his way to go homeless in 2 years. The drunk driver didn't plan to go on the road to kill someone. In fact, he got drunk because he was depressed that he lost his job and felt that it was the end of the world for him. What the judge should have done instead was place him in a rehabilitation program that would allow him to get his life back on track. The punishment for the tragic accident can still happen, but instead of sitting in prison being unproductive for two more years a social worker can work with him to help him find a job, deal with his mental health and life concerns, and climb his way out of the mess back into society. Putting a longer/life sentence or death penalty on someone won't bring back the loss or reverse what happened, but having a program that helps people move forward is more cost-effective and beneficial for everyone involved.

"CMV: Anime should always be adapted as accurate to the source manga as possible, unless the manga author requests otherwise.",10,j91ozc,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j91ozc/cmv_anime_should_always_be_adapted_as_accurate_to/,16,2020-10-11 16:20:59,"I’ll be using JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure. Attack on Titan, and Tokyo Ghoul as my examples. 

The JJBA anime is extremely faithful to the manga. While obviously not a 100% accurate adaptation, it stays faithful to it in most cases. As such, the anime is pretty damn good. 

Attack on Titan is a fairly accurate adaptation, with a few changes requested by the original creator Hahime Isayama. I think anyone can tell you Attack on Titan is one of the greatest anime ever created, and I believe that is in large part due to the accuracy to the manga, sans a few changes the author requested, mainly to season 3. 

Anime that don’t stay faithful to the manga, such as Tokyo Ghoul, often fall flat. Tokyo Ghoul’s first season is agreed by most to be amazing, but it quickly declines in quality after that. Season 2 is lukewarm at its best and atrocious at its worst, and season 3 is horrible all around. (I gave up before season 4, so it may have improved in quality and i may just be unaware.) Tokyo Ghoul is an inaccurate adaptation after season 1, and I believe that’s a major reason why Tokyo Ghoul fell off as hard as it did. 

Im open to other opinions, but to me, the trend seems to be that anime that are more faithful to the source material generally turn out better. Therefore, anime should always be adapted as close as possible to the manga unless changes are requested by the original author.",changemyview
"CMV: The usage of the term ""LatinX"" is culturally imperialist and likely racist.",152,j910ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j910ik/cmv_the_usage_of_the_term_latinx_is_culturally/,74,2020-10-11 15:19:14,"I  believe Americans who utilize this term are engaging in the act of  cultural imperialism. The racism aspect of it is more nuanced, however.

For starters, the English language already has a neutral to describe Latinos, it's Latin(s)/Latin people(s). Similar to American or  Dominican.  There are no calls for ""American"" to be made gender neutral,  as it already is. Why not utilize an existing word that already  describes the demographic in question?

Spanish/Portuguese  also have a neutral already, it's Latino. It serves as both the  masculine and the neutral. Grammatically that might seem strange to an English speaker, but that's the reality of those languages, they are  naturally gendered and that's how they're structured (though not  always). I am in complete support of Latin American-made initiatives to change this, such as the recent utilization of ""Latines"" in various  universities (hopefully other institutions soon as well!) in Rio de Janeiro.

Bear with me as I  maneuver this; Americans appropriated the words Latino from Spanish/Portuguese to invent a new category of people in the 90s,  (Hispanic was invented in the 80s, so I guess Brazilians didn't exist  before the 90s haha) and ignored half the meaning and utilization of the word. This is likely to be from ignorance and we shouldn't throw people under the bus for ignorance, but isn't that what the bad  type of appropriation is regardless? Appropriation in ignorance? Likely, the term was appropriated by the government to separate white/black Central/South Americans from North Americans. (speculation, not really  part of the scope of this but I'd be interested on your take.) This is  the racism bit.

So, they appropriated the word Latino, and then made up ""LatinX"". LatinX was created to be inclusionary and neutral. But they ignored that word they appropriated also is used as a neutral, all the while forgetting that their language already has a neutral.

As a first  generation immigrant who is active in my community here in the states, and I know this is  anecdotal, but I've only ever seen white people and 2nd/3rd generation Latinos (i.e. culturally American) use LatinX. I'm not one for gatekeeping of course, but 2/3 generations down there's always a certain level of assimilation. I believe it's a very offensive term. Many of my fellow 1st generation immigrants agree. Again, anecdotal. I'm sure there are plenty who think it's fine.

TLDR;

In conclusion, it just feels like the good ol' American cultural  imperialism, pushing whatever they believe to be correct onto other countries/cultures/languages, even if indirectly. A possible other  explanation is that in an effort to find ""representation"", third  generation Americans with little knowledge of their linguistic heritage have decided to use the imported ""Latino"" from Spanish/Portuguese,  ignoring it's original meaning in it's own language, using the word as masculine only for some reason, and then changing it to LatinX to be gender neutral as the word they appropriated didn't suit them anymore, all the while ignoring that the gender neutral word ""Latin"" already exists in English.

P.S.  I can only speak on Spanish/Portuguese as these are the ones that I speak myself, sorry for any grammatical mistakes.

&#x200B;

Edit: For some more context, Latino was derived from Latinoamericano. There's some speculation that Napoleon straight up invented THAT term when he went to war against now Mexico. Also, I don't know if I'm allowed to post links here, but there's a very interesting article discussing the invention of Hispanic/Latino for the purposes of the distinction of peoples. Obviously don't take it as fact if you find it, but its an interesting read with interesting conclusions.

Edit2: Removed the word ""white-washed"" from describing 2nd/3rd generation Americans as it is needlessly inflammatory as other people have suggested. That was my bad. I was just trying to highlight the differences between the different generations as important distinctions. Of course, I will have a different set of problems regarding my identity as a 1st generation than a 2nd/3rd (onwards) generation immigrant who deals more with the duality of both American and X cultures.",changemyview

If you already have a spinner and board, or if you just wanna eat the candy, you can buy a $0.99 bag of 32 pieces of candy.

The candy is basically like Sweetarts, except shaped like either skulls and bones, or coins, the spinner has the numbers 1-3 in red, and 4-6 in green, and the board has a line from start to finish.

You play like this:

* 2 players can play. To play, you need at least 8 pieces of candy, and both players must bring in the same amount. Each player will place one piece on the starting space to begin.
* When it's your turn, spin the spinner. If it lands on a red number (1-3) you move that many spaces backward (or nowhere if you're on start). If it lands on a green number (4-6), you move that many spaces forward.
* If you land on a ? space, you choose a category and the other player asks you any question based on that. If you can't answer it correctly your piece moves back to start. If you land on another player's piece, that piece goes to where your piece just was.
* The goal is to be the first one to get to the finish space, and the player who does keeps all of their opponent's candy.

I think surveillance is a powerful tool that the government can use for our best interest, and since we live in a democracy, we should be happy to empower a government that we pay for and we elect.   


I will give one example of what I like about surveillance, and how it fits my overall framework for supporting it. We have a criminal justice system that is flawed because it is based on imperfect information. We routinely put people in prison for long stretches for crimes that they did not commit, all because of a half remembered eye witness. If more people were under more surveillance we would see less people wrongly convicted because they would have access to alibis that hold up in court. I know this is my idealism and in reality, the court system is not so simple, and often is is built on plea deals and expediency, but if we are going to have a legal system empowered to ruin a person's life, shouldn't that system have the most possible information with which to verify its accusations? Because that is what surveillance is. It's information that we can use to assertain the truth. I am all for warrants and due process and protection against prejudgement, but all those things can exist at the same time as robust surviellance, as long as their are good laws dictating when and were that surviellance can be used against or, or for us.",changemyview

There should be no penalties for not registering and there should be more of an incentive to register (i.e. it should not give the people who are required to register **baseline** ""perks"").

Is there a reason why only men are required to register for the Selective Service? Is there a reason why men who do not register are ineligible for Federal benefits, including Federal Student Aid? Is there a reason why the Selective Service still exists?

EDIT:

I have come to a new understanding of where my head lies in this discussion. If there is some other talking point I did not consider, I welcome discussion pertaining to that point. Otherwise,

My point boils down to either of the following logical solutions:

A) Abolish the Selective Service System, the requirements for men ages 18-25 to register, and, by proxy, all punitive measures associated with refusal to register

B) Apply the requirement for registration with the Selective Service to all people ages 18-25, and, by proxy, apply all punitive measures associated with refusal to register to this new set of people.

My mind can be changed under the following circumstances:

Either there exists a third solution that I did not consider; One or both of my proposed solutions are flawed in some way; There is some justification for restricting the Selective Service Requirement to specifically men ages 18-25 **and** there is a justification for allowing those who are not burdened by the requirement to receive federal benefits denied to those who are required to register but refuse.",changemyview

His supporters for the most part feel that their voice has been removed from politics. They feel that their concerns are ignored while the concerns of others are addressed front and center. They feel forgotten and left out. They are not wrong.

The problem is Trump is not competent enough in the role of the president to be effective at it. He is also patently incapable of acknowledging this fact. While at the same time, to his supporters, he is the only person in government to prioritize their concerns.

The worst of all of this is that there is a general misunderstanding of what the problems are. Illegal immigrants are not taking jobs, automation is. Smart people are not leaving small towns because they hate their family and neighbors, it is because the only decent jobs are knowledge work. These jobs require college. College does not teach people to hate God and become immoral. It teaches people to think critically and objectively about their own beliefs and observations.

What is important is not the outcome, but the process. People need to respect each other. I have never met anyone that wanted to destroy America. We all want America to be the best country in the world. We kind of all have the same idea of what that looks like, at least from the perspective of everyone having a decent life through reasonable effort.

I think gender is based on stereotypes, and that's why i think it's wrong and should be abolished. I can sort of imagine why trans people think as they do, because we live in a society where people expect you to act in a specific way based on your condition of man/woman. Gender is a spectrum and it's drew on society, but i don't understand the necessity of it. I think people should be able to think, feel and act as they do without having to assign themselves a gender. For example, why call yourself a woman if  you ~~just~~ like ~~feminine things and other~~ matters involving the feminine gender?, that's kind of unfair to biological women, like, why are you assuming that you are a woman just because you think in a certain way? 

I believe people can behave and dress as they want without having to change their pronouns and start using hormones. I don't like having this transphobic view, but any of the things I've read could change my mind.

Anyway, I think trans people *should* be respected; if a trans woman says she's a woman, then she *is* one, and shall be treated as one (that's why i disagree with radical feminists). I think we should teach people and younger generations that they can do whatever they want without having to choose another gender and change their appearance in order to fit in with the chosen gender.

Edit: I've always wanted to ask this to a trans person and also ask them what made them realise they were transgender, but i never did that because I thought it was probably inappropriate.

1) Characters

The three main characters are fun, unique, and convincing. Unlike the vast majority of isekai or ""protagonist stories"", their development goes beyond that. Twilight is the best spy possible, but he doesn't always succeed. He is forced into a mission where he has to depend on Anya and Yor to fulfill the family as a cover story. Later on, without Anya's help he potentially would've been killed in an explosion. Even when he succeeds, all his missions are funny with mishaps and absurdities happening (especially when Yor densely believes in his psychiatrist position hitting people for counseling).

 Yor herself is an intriguing character as she is an assassin/hitman who is badass yet reveals her face willingly to imply her ability to perform the job perfectly. She reveals that she is a kind person deep down, even while horrible at cooking and a slightly disturbing mindset, due to being ruthless in killing. She tries her best to fulfill her role as ""wife"", despite being awkward at it.

Finally we have Anya, who is my favorite character. Being a psychic mindreader, she allows us to have an excuse to gain insight into all the characters. Though of course, since she has to get the bad guy's trust, merely knowing their thoughts isn't enough. She has to act well enough to gain the support of tsundere Damien, who is rich, arrogant, and spoiled. She struggles to act normally, due to her young age and condition, but she greatly helps attribute to comedy, and the unique idea combines with her cute look to make fans a character they can sympathize well with.

Indeed, even the side characters are very intriguing. Recently introduced as Nightfall, a seemingly emotionless spy partner to Twilight, but secretly in love with him. The way she acts and how she can be jealous despite her outward appearance is incredibly humorous. And Yor's brother, a secret police, also has funny shenanigans, especially how he can't take the idea of Yor being close to another man, and loses his sense of composure when it comes to this romance relation.

2) Plot

The plot is relatively straight-forward: Spy has to save the day by pretending to be in a family, and having them infiltrate the enemy, becoming friends with them. But each mission contributes its own theme to the story. One example is with the funny side plot of Anya trying to beat a kid who was far too physically superior, by using her mind reading skills. Another is when Twilight brings his family to zoo and there is a device hidden in a penguin's throat, so he is forced to pretend to be an employee, masterfully understanding the role and quickly succeeding his mission. 

Though Twilight is a master of all trades, the plot helps present his humanity and emotions growing. He was detached from relations before, but throughout chapters, he had been off guard from Anya, embarrassed to even try kissing Yor, and even reserving a room in a castle to entertain Anya. Similarly, Anya seems to have a greater understanding of the world. Though she couldn't comprehend Damien's tsundere nature, she began standing up for other people. She was at first proud to earn a star, but she was humbled later. And while at first nervous to interact with people, she later avenged Yor by intimidating a man chasing after her life, and even saved someone from drowning in a pool.

3) Legacy

Spy X Family is one of the most read mangas currently and is very ""hot"". Few and far mangas in between produced in 2020 match the quality of this manga. Even against the touching story of the old man and his cat, Spy x Family pushed out a victory in awards, proving that its humor and unique story plus characters could beat ""mundane done well"". It seems clear to me that Spy x Family is the best manga of the year.",changemyview

This might be the wrong sub and I apologize for not have my idea fleshed out more so it more suitable to debate. 


Ok so im not sure where I fall but I guess I would say my personal morals lie with being pro life but I understand that its unrealistic to ban or restrict abortion for many reasons. I know there are a ton of flaws in my basic point of view but I will try to elaborate to the best if my ability. Alot of my points do not go into detail on how it is possible to judge or enforce these ""laws"". Most of my points are assuming that these repercussions are held to the same prinicble as any law that is broken whether big or small and that due process of the law is exercised to the fullest.

So to elaborate on my main point, although abortion is nesscsary, I personally feel that the termination of potential human life due to gross negligence meaning choosing to have unprotected sex when the tools and info are widely available to both offending parties is something that is appalling to me and shouldn't not go unpunished. the is this is purely under ""normal"" circumstances of gross negligence and anything out of said circumstance should be treated as a normal abortion with no penalties. (Again the details of this would be something that is heavily deliberated on and deffinetly something I shouldnt be coming up with by myself but I can give some examples)

I was thinking that age would obviously have a factor meaning that any minor that is pregnant this would obviously not apply to them in any way other then the teachings of practicing safe sex and where to get more information regarding safe sex. Not to say that minors are allowed to get abortions every other week with out some sort of repercussion. 

Now in regards to a legal adult getting an abortion under ""normal"" circumstances mean non life threatening/rape/ or anything out of there control which includes the failure of birth control. Then then both parents are responsible for the gross negligent termination of possible human life and should be held responsible by paying a fine or community service of some sort for the first offense or maybe a warning the first time. (How late the fetus is would also be a factor in the repercussion)

Now if its repeting offenses then the repercussions would get higher and extra measures would be taken of which im not sure of.

Again this only falls under the normal circumstance of gross negligence or lack of respect for potential life that lead to robbing a ""bunch of cells"" that we all came from as chance at life. I understand that abortion can never be banned due to the safety and wellbeing of the baby and mother but to willing end potential life needs to to have weight and shouldn't be treated lightly.


I understand my POV has a million plot hole but if you need me to elaborate on something let me know. But I don't agree with either side, it unrealistic to ban abortions completely as you don't know the situation. On the other hand no matter how you look at it whether you think its a woman's body or its not life in the womb, it still factually the termination of potential human life, potential life that we all came from and there needs to justice for those who didn't even get a chance.

To get to more concrete evidence, when you scan it tells you your color (again, why would this be mentioned if it was the color of a layer of 'clothing'), your height, and your weight. Every single crewmate is 3 ft 6 in and 92 pounds. Not only would it be extremely strange for 8 humans to weigh the exact same and be the same height, this is obviously not a normal human height/weight.   


3. Oxygen  
To give some background, the imposters can call a sabotage that makes oxygen run out. If they truly were wearing space suits, why would this matter? While it's true they'd have to fix the oxygen eventually, it wouldn't be a 30 second emergency if they were truly wearing space suits that provide oxygen.  


4. Imposter kill animations  
A kill animation that I think spurred a lot of fanart is one where the imposter's tongue stabs the victim in the head. This may make some think that a full game of 10 is 8 regular humans and 2 imposters that are some kind of monstrous creature. However, given the evidence that the crewmates aren't human either, it's possible that all 10 are the same race. In short, that's something they could all technically do, and the imposters are just bad people who choose to kill and aren't biologically different/a different race as the crewmates.

CMV: I cannot see how being a Progressive Christian could be considered Biblical given my upbringing.,15,j8sdo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j8sdo4/cmv_i_cannot_see_how_being_a_progressive/,121,2020-10-11 05:09:50,"Hi there, I am a young adult and have been questioning my life over the last few years. I still believe the premise that I often get out of life what I put into it. However, for the past few months, I have been wrestling about whether a ""conservative"" Christian faith works well for me. When I was a child and teen, I was raised in a conservative Christian household that stressed obedience to authority and structure. I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome at 3 so that really made things easier for me to accept that upbringing.

At my age now, I have been an adult for a few years and finally feel confident in completing things step by step to mature and evolve to what my heart desires rather than looking backwards. The last thing I'm wrestling with is my faith upbringing. I still believe in God, and Jesus dying on the cross to cover the sins of others. I believe that the Bible has worth. Now granted, I am biases due to clinging onto the book.

That said, when I look at what's going on in the culture (US culture) over the past 25 years, it makes me feel like this country is inching closer onto Armageddon. So I feel that a faith is still a good thing since it enriches my life and helps me stay grounded if I'm in a fire situation in regards to my health, finances, relationships, etc.

Basically, faith is my current ideal core support system that I don't know how I would consider replacing. A progressive Christian faith would sound nice and all, but it doesn't make sense since all of the faith I was exposed to was traditional and obedience based. In my mind, I often get the guilt feeling of ""false prophet"" if I consider a ""liberal Christian"" faith.

Now I know, I'm an adult, and I get to decide what to believe from here on out. But actions have consequences and I wonder if I cannot have a fulfilling life being flexible with enjoying a spiritual walk. I haven't been reading the Bible nor praying as much as I think I should.

I know this is not ideal, but I'm asking questions and willing to reconsider views I held strongly in the past, but am willing to change now due to exposure to new culture and ideas since starting college. I have used this subreddit before to discuss ideas and sometimes successfully changed my views.",changemyview

(**STOP**. I know what you're thinking. Why would I be posting my own controversial opinion then? Please read the entire post before replying.)

Think about it for a moment: when we engage in political discussions or arguments in person or online, do we actually intend to change a person's mind? Do we think it will actually work?

How often does it actually work? And the other side of the coin: when was the last time you significantly changed your thinking in response to a conversation you had with someone who disagreed with you?

Let's be honest: most often, ""debate"" is often a euphemism for intellectual masturbation.

\[Even though I consider myself a liberal and organized for the Warren campaign last fall and winter,\] I have often criticized the left (really both sides, for a variety of reasons) for being too alarmist and self-righteous and only appealing to their side. (After all, terms like ""microaggressions"", ""safe spaces,"" and ""patriarchy,"" for whatever truth they might reflect or value they might have, only set progressives up for ridicule by the very people whose actions they denounce.) But maybe this is, actually, the most effective strategy for them to employ if they want to make any kind of impact on the world. After all, isn't it much more effective to try to rally your own side, rather than trying to win over others?

Of course, we could probably all point to some examples of healthy, mutually beneficial, challenging, and interesting conversations that we've had, but I think these are the exception rather than the rule. Most of what we do, most of the time, is remain in our echo chambers and feed off of people we already agree with.

And maybe that's not such a bad thing?

Does this mean that I won't engage in any more discussions with people who disagree with me? No; I probably will. But I shouldn't have any illusions about the likely results. At most, I can do my best to be open to differing opinions myself, even if I don't always succeed at this. Anyway, debate can be fun, and, sometimes, I can manage to avoid being too stubborn to learn anything from it. If nothing else, it stokes my own passion for what I believe. And again, maybe that's the point.

**Bottom line: debates between people with strong differences in opinion often fail to produce any changes in the thinking of any of the involved parties. Change my view.**

First of all, thank you to all who have contributed here. There have been some really great insights and some wonderful things to keep in mind. In particular, the comments regarding the importance of interlocutor's emotions, about the mixing of rationality and irrationality, logos and pathos, were very valuable.

I do have to say as well that I am just a bit frustrated with many of these comments. As I stated in the OP, there are--of course!--exceptions. I think this entire forum is one great exception to this entire OP, which is fantastic and definitely worth celebrating! Please understand that I am absolutely NOT saying that we should NEVER attempt to engage in debate/conversation. That would be a total blanket statement--aside from being ridiculous, given that I am posting here and we're trying to reason with each other.

Also, so far, no one has taken up the idea of whether or not it's better to focus on rallying one's own side rather than persuading the other side. Am I all alone on that one? It's okay if I am, but I would really like to talk about that part of it as well.",changemyview
CMV: Modern and even mainstream hip hop music gets a lot of unfair hate and is actually really good,5,j8reoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j8reoh/cmv_modern_and_even_mainstream_hip_hop_music_gets/,75,2020-10-11 04:13:23,"I don't think this is an unpopular opinion irl but from what I've seen on reddit it kinda seems to be. I'm not talking about people who personally don't like modern rap. That's cool everyone has their preferences but I'm talking about people who actively go out of their way to complain about and hate on modern rap music. I've seen so many people call modern rap talentless and an extreme downgrade from rap from the 90's and music from that time period in general but I just don't think thats true. Music is meant to evolve and change over time and rap has done exactly that.

If you want real deep lyrical content thats meant to really make you think and try to comprehend what the artist is saying theres amazing lyrical rappers like j cole and kendrick lamar who have put out incredible records. If you want a song that you can vibe to at a party or in the car with your friends theres so much rap for that too. Not every song has to have some kind of deep lyrical meaning for you to be able to enjoy it without someone saying ""that takes no talent to make"".

Another criticism I see is how a lot of melodic rappers rely heavily on autotune which I also dont think is fair because these artists use autotune as its own instrument and a lot of these melodic rappers are actually decent singers as they've proven from live shows and things like that they just choose to use the autotune cus it fits the genre of music and they believe it sounds good. I get that that's personal preference but its not fair to denounce an artists talent because they use autotune and you're not used to that type of sound in music.

I also hear people talking about how all rappers nowadays sound the same and everyone with ""lil"" in their name makes the exact same music but if you actually listen to a lil uzi vert song, lil peep song, and a lil dicky song and genuinely think they sound anything like each other you need your hearing checked because these people are all vastly different in both their lyrical content and their musical content as a whole.

Even rappers like lil pump and tekashi 6ix9ine do actually have talent because while their music is probably fairly easy to make, they've managed to built an entire brand for themselves and monetize that incredibly well while keeping a easy to spot and widely known persona through the internet and even tho they're music itself might not necessarily take ""talent"", its catchy and a lot of people like listening to it so that's all that really matters at the end of the day.

One more criticism I hear is that modern rap artists don't write their own songs or create their own instrumentals. Saying rappers don't write their music is just flat out not true because they do, but the criticism of rappers not making their own beats isnt fair either. Most rappers work with a producer to find a beat that they want to use for their song and they have input over what they want it to sound like while the producer makes it. It's a collaborative process where the rapper does what he/she is best at which is rapping and the producer does what he/she is best at which is producing to come up with something that neither could've dont on their own.

There's probably other criticisms that I forgot to address but this is all I could think of and I get that modern rap music isn't for everyone, especially older people who aren't used to that whole sound in music, but I don't think it's fair to say that any kind of music is worse or takes less talent just because you don't personally find it appealing from the bits of it you hear on the radio or something",changemyview

In most countries, underage drinking isn't even a crime. It is generally only sellers who get punished. However, in the US, an 18 year old who just holds a can of beer is breaking the law. That makes no sense.

Given the fact that it is so common for people under 21 to drink alcohol, it makes no sense to keep the drinking age at 21. The punishment for underage drinking is already basically just a slap on the wrist. If the government barely even enforces the law, it makes no sense to keep the law. The drinking age should be lowered to something more reasonable like 18. The current laws are ridiculous and makes no sense.",changemyview
"CMV: Mazda rates their rotary engines at 1/3 of their true displacement. A ""1.3L"" rotary engine is really a 3.9L.",5,j8ql4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j8ql4o/cmv_mazda_rates_their_rotary_engines_at_13_of/,18,2020-10-11 03:25:54,"I understand that Japan's engine size regulations played a part in Mazda developing rotary engines, but I can't see an engine like the 13B-MSP Renesis is a 1.3L engine. Practically, there are 6 volumes of air in the engine. Two rotors with three sides each. Each of these chambers is analogous to a cylinder and has an intake volume of 654cc, so saying the engine is a 1.3L only counts two of the chambers. 

People also claim that the engine is a 2.6L. The logic is that since a piston engine intakes half its displacement for every rotation, and a ""1.3L"" rotary displaces 1.3L per rotation, it is equivalent to a 2.6L piston engine. This reasoning is also incorrect because a piston engine completes more strokes per rotation than a rotary, 2 strokes per piston per rotation vs 1 stroke per combustion chamber per rotation.

I believe the true displacement of a ""1.3L"" rotary is 3.9L. There are 6 volumes which each displace 654cc. Each volume goes through all 4 strokes independently, just like cylinders. Therefore a 2 rotor ""1.3L"" engine is equivalent to a 3.9L 6 cylinder engine. The difference arises from engine speed. The RX-8 had up to a 9000 rpm redline, and therefore could displace 11700 L/min in theory. For a 3.9L 6 cylinder to do that, it would only have to rev to 6000 rpm, as many engines do.

Based on this perspective, rotary engines seem, as one would expect, much more comparable to piston engines. A 1.3L naturally aspirated engine making 232hp is unheard of outside of high performance race engines. A 3.9L engine revving to 9000rpm and making 232hp sounds pretty low. But a 3.9L engine making 232hp around 6000 rpm is about right. The difference in speed also brings the RX-8's low torque into perspective. There is effectively a 1.5x speed increase over an equivalent piston engine, so 159 lb-ft of torque from a rotary would be like 239 lb-ft from a piston engine, which again is comparable.

Calling the 13B a 1.3L or 2.6L engine makes it seem like its high power comes from its high redline and implies that it completes more cycles per minute than a piston engine, when this really isn’t the case. Comparing apples to apples and acknowledging that rotary engines do not make high power per liter makes it much more clear what the true advantage of the rotary engine is – it fits a large displacement into a small and simple package.",changemyview
CMV: Death Penalty should be abolished as it is barbaric and does no justice or crime prevention whatsoever,40,j8qi60,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j8qi60/cmv_death_penalty_should_be_abolished_as_it_is/,99,2020-10-11 03:21:03,"So I got the idea of this from watching The Green Mile (Excellent film may I say) and it just reenforced my hatred of the death penalty. 

The reasons for my disagreement of the death penalty is because I think first of all it is extremely barbaric. This is because you are essentially taking one extra life for the sake of justice but as we have learned in the past, executing criminals does nothing but cause more damage to society as a whole and in no way affects the rate of crime.

The second reason I oppose it is because there are many people who have been executed for a crime they haven't committed. This is either due to an extremely biased jury and/or racial profiling. There are many people who have even gone to prison for petty crimes that they haven't actually commited and then have been found innocent later on and the reason for their original conviction is because of a jury/judge that has profiled a person or been biased or new evidence that could completely overturn the case has not come to light yet.

The third reason is that it is essentially murder commited by the government. You are essentially taking the life of another person at the end of the day which by standard definition, is murder. Murder could be the reason the convicted person is being punished for, so why kill them 20 years later. That to me just seems wrong. The person who may also be pushing the poison into the veins of said convict or pulling the lever to electrocute them.

I've seen so many videos at this point of parents beating the shit out of their kids as punishment, and then I'm genuinely shocked when I scroll down to the comments just to see people talking about how their parents did it to them, and praising the parent for it..... WTF???? Why is this normal? I feel like most people think its ok just because their parents did it to them, but this shit is barbaric and does virtually nothing to actually teach the child that what they did is wrong and why it is wrong. Just because your parents beat you and you feel like you turned out fine doesn't mean that its good parenting, nor that it also works for everyone else. And if you want to use that argument I can also say that there are plenty of other people out there who DIDNT get beat and they also turned out just fine. This shit just comes off as parents with no self control, wanting to vent THEIR frustrations on their kid, as opposed to actually raising them to be decent people. Youre not ""preparing you kid for the real world"", nor are you doing this to ""toughen up your kid"", stop rationalizing it after the fact, you're just mad and have no idea how to express that to your kid without beating the shit out of them.

I know that parents usually mean well when they do this but its important to understand that there are multiple ways of teaching children right from wrong. People just view punishment as the only way to curb behavior, but reinforcement of good behaviors is just as, if not more effective. Its not NESSESSARY to physically punish your kids, and not only is it unnecessary but it can lead to very shitty, unintended consequences. There's a huge body of research that shows that kids who were physically punished are more likely to, be more violent in the future, be more abusive, have less cognitive ability, continue their behavior long-term, distance themselves from parent, develop anxiety and other mental issues etc. Its just not good and there are so many better alternatives. You guys may laugh, but doing cool shit with your kids and giving them privileges as reinforcement, while also talking away privileges as punishment seems to be the most effective way to do this. Seems corny but it is what it is. I'm ok with a quick little slap if a kid is freaking the fuck out in public and short term punishment is needed to urgently stop the behavior, but its pretty unacceptable for this to happen regularly.

But that isn't my reasoning, there are a lot of f\*\*\*\*\* up countries in the world, even more than China.

My POV is more based on the historical context. I often compare China with this hypothetical:

Imagine nearing the end of WW2, the Russians push the German army from the east back into Germany, and the Allies push from the west. Except in this hypothetical, the Allies and Russia decide its not worth continuing into Germany, and do not force Nazi Germany to surrender Germany. Nazi Germany continue to rule Germany and other than world domination, they continue their crimes against humanity within their country.

Would we, all of a sudden, restart trade with Nazi Germany simply because the war is over? I really don't think so. I believe the moral pressure and political pressure would result in an absolute, no trade policy with Nazi Germany, just as we have with North Korea today.

So the only difference with China IMO, is that they did even more abhorrent crimes than the Nazis, yet we continued and continue to have an enormous economic relationship with them.

Full disclosure: I am without a doubt a pro free market believer, I believe that global trade makes the world more wealthy as whole. So this POV is not based on anything to do with economics, but simply a moral argument, and how the west ought to hold countries to account for their crimes.",changemyview

I can only think of reasons why I should be ashamed of my virginity and not reasons why I shouldn't worry about it. Here is my rationale: 

Being a virgin means that the opportunity for sex never happened. For most guys, university age is when they have their first sexual opportunity, which can happen either through online dating, meeting a girl at a club or hobby group, or through a friendship circle. As someone who has been through all that with no sexual opportunity it can only mean that I wasn't attractive enough to get anyones attention, while other guys were, since women at that age are just as eager to have sexual relationships with men they are attracted to, as men are with women. Women have romantic and sexual desires to and the fact that none of them ever came to me to have those desires fulfilled for them, even though I would've been a sure thing, means that they never thought of me as an option because there is something wrong with me.

Being a virgin means that I've missed out on an important growing up milestone. A lot of people cherish being young and in love because love and sex are better when you experience it as two young attractive people. 

Sex and love are the greatest things a person can experience. The physical sensation of it feels like a dream come true for anyone lucky enough to experience it. I would be happier if I could too, just like everyone else. 

Society stigmatizes virgins. This definitely doesn't help me feel better and only makes me feel that I'm right to be unhappy, as nobody wants to be stigmatized.

Obviously some people are just going to be bad drivers regardless, but I can’t even fault these people because they’re never required to learn.

IMO, you should be required to re-take a driver’s test at age 60 and then continue retaking it every 5 years. Ideally, everyone should just take it every 10 years regardless of age, but the 60 year old rule would at least start to eliminate the people who are physically incapable of driving safely.

This argument sits outside of those schools. I would like to argue that the properties intrinsic in the concept of free will are at odds with each other, no matter what school you follow. For the sake of argument I will assume that the world around us is real in the sense that it sits outside our minds.

Whether or not a will is free is an expression of whether the decisions made by the mind with the supposed will are free.

We can categorize a decision in either being the product of outside influences or not.

Now what is a decision? The purpose of a decision is to manipulate our environment into a more advantageous position based on the information available to us when acted on it. If the mind was not taking in outside information (which it very clearly does) it would barely be better than a dice, which I would argue couldn't be called a decision at all. (Controversial, I know.) It fails the very purpose of a decision.

If a decision is simply the product of outside influences it can not be free, since if the influences are the same, the decision will be the same. If it is not the product of outside influences we have established it is not a decision at all. Therefore the concept of a free will does not make sense by the properties within it.

The thing is, if it’s reasonable to say that we shouldn’t judge them, why does it follow that we should therefore celebrate them for what we see as good things they did? If we can look back and say that a historical figure did good things, despite being potentially hated in their time by certain groups (I’m sure king George and parliament did not look to favourably on the rebellious Americans) for actions that we now see as good, we can we not look back in disgust at actions which may at the time have been considered normal?

CMV: Scrooge is among the most generous characters in literature.,8,j8blgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j8blgl/cmv_scrooge_is_among_the_most_generous_characters/,89,2020-10-10 09:21:54,"To be absolutely clear, I am speaking strictly about pre-haunting Scrooge.

Here is my definition of generosity: Providing good things for others, without expecting something in return.

Here is my argument: 

Scrouge works hard. He works from dawn till dusk, and even on Christmas. In an economy like the one Scrooge inhabits, work can be characterized as providing a good or a service to someone else in exchange for money. So, Scrooge is doing good things for others, but they are giving him money in return. That's not exactly generous.

But money is just a store of value and is itself worthless. It only provides value when spent. Scrooge spends as little as possible. He dresses plainly, eats porridge, and doesn't heat his home. He lives like a poor man.

So Scrooge is working hard to provide other people with lots of value, but is himself receiving the bear minimum in actual value. This seems to meet the definition of generous, but who is Scrooge being generous to? He is certainly not being generous to the people he works for because they pay him.

To answer this, examine the effects of hoarding money. At some point, Scrooge will die and his wealth will go to someone else. Because he has no children or conceivable heirs, it will probably go to the state. This qualifies as generous because he is giving a huge sum to society with no expectation of reward.

But what about before Scrooge dies, or what if he buries his money and no one gets it? It doesn't matter, the money still goes back to society. Scrooge removing the money from circulation will cause deflation and proportionally increase the value of everyone else's money. Now, what if deflation is a bad thing in your mind? The state can simply increase the money supply by an equal amount, so there is no effect, and it is just like he gave the money to the state directly.

So, Scrooge works incredibly hard, and almost all the earnings from this work will be redistributed, one way or another, to society. All this time, Scrooge takes almost nothing for himself. This makes him an extremely generous man.


Now, let me preempt a few arguments:

Scrooge is a banker, so his work isn't actually providing a good or service to other people. (IE: I think bankers are parasites and Scrooge would just be returning stolen money): This would take time to address, but bankers do provide a real service. Bankers connect people with money to lend to people who want to borrow money, and facilitate the exchange. If you aren't convinced, then just suppose Scrooge has some other job but is otherwise unchanged.

Giving to the state is not generous: It certainly is, provided it was freely done (not taxes). The state may spend the money in some disagreeable ways, but the same is true of giving it to a man. On the whole, the state will probably do good with it. And the issue of generosity doesn't actually hinge on whether their is an unforeseen bad outcome. If I give a begger some money, and he uses it to overdose and die, I was still generous.

Causing deflation isn't generous: Why not? It's like saying for every dollar you have, I will give you a penny. Granted, this means Scrooge's giving is biased towards those who already have money, but that doesn't make him any less generous. Also, even though the effect per person will be tiny, it's still real.

Scrooge could spend the money: Yes, at any moment Scrooge could start spending the money and live in luxery, and my argument would be overturned. My argument relies on the assumption Scrooge will never spend it.

Scrooge doesn't mean to be generous: This is in my opinion the best counter argument.i suppose you could add an astrix to this that Scrooge is unintentionally generous.


So to recap, Scrooge is working really hard and earning a lot, and therefore probably creating a lot of value for society. But Scrooge is receiving back from society very little. So somehow, Scrooge is being generous. If we look at Scrooge's day to day interactions, there is no outlet of generosity, but look deeper and we see that inflation/state inheritance is the outlet.",changemyview
"CMV: If you're skinny-fat and you want to get ""ripped"", it's better to cut before bulking.",4,j81kvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j81kvz/cmv_if_youre_skinnyfat_and_you_want_to_get_ripped/,40,2020-10-09 23:57:23,"**TL;DR**

Cutting lends itself better to being a SMART goal than bulking, and it is faster, hence the title.

**\TL;DR**

Just so we're on the same page, I'll define a few terms per what they mean to me.

**Skinny-fat:** Having a body-weight/BMI that puts you in the ""normal range"" (i.e. BMI < 25.0) but having a higher body-fat percentage than what counts as ""fit"" or ""healthy"" (i.e. > ~18% for men, > ~25% for women, though this varies a bit depending on who is counting). Qualitatively, this person doesn't look overweight, but also has little muscular definition and maintains a soft, doughy sort of look.

**Ripped:** Having a body-fat percentage in the ""athletic"" zone (i.e. > ~6-13% for men, > ~14-20% for women) with visible muscle definition, i.e. not skin and bones. Possibly ""overweight"" by the BMI number.

**Cutting:** Losing fat. A subset of losing weight that seeks to maintain muscle mass or minimize its loss.

**Bulking:** Gaining muscle. A subset of gaining weight that seeks to maintain fat mass or minimize its gain.

*I'll also disclaim that this post is inspired by my own experiences of, and future plans for, my own fitness quest. Nevertheless, I believe that my points are generally applicable to the greater part of the population at large.*

If you're skinny-fat and you desire to get ripped, you have two goals to achieve that seem to lie at cross-purposes: you need to lose a significant amount of fat but also gain a large amount of lean muscle mass. Unfortunately, these goals are pursued through opposing methods. That is to say that losing fat requires a caloric deficit, but this risks cannibalizing existing muscle mass, while gaining muscle requires a caloric surplus (in addition to weight training and adequate protein intake), but this risks adding on even more fat.

So, what do you do? You have to achieve both goals eventually, but you need to start with one.

I'm convinced that it is better to begin by cutting before switching over to bulking. This is because cutting tends to be more amenable to SMART goals.

If you want to achieve a certain sort of look for your body, then you will discover that such a look is associated with a range of body fat percentages. Though body fat measurements tend to be imprecise, you can still get a rough idea of where you are and where you need to be, and thus come up with a target body fat percentage. You can use your current and target fat percentage numbers to calculate a goal weight, set a time-limit on when you want to achieve that weight, and thus create a plan for a daily calorie deficit that incorporates diet and exercise.

It is generally understood that a 500-calorie daily deficit is sufficient to lose 1 pound of fat per week. And even an aggressive 1000-calorie daily deficit (2 pounds of fat per week) can be sustainable, depending on your current percentage and your ability to put up with the grind.

As a bonus, weight loss tends to be associated with cardio. If you are an untrained neophyte, the weight-loss phase can also provide an opportunity for aerobic training, improving heart and lung functionality. Add in calisthenics and you can prime your muscles and joints for future work with heavy weights.

On the other hand, muscle gain is a much more long-term goal. If you're skinny but doughy, you will need to add a very large quantity of muscle before any definition becomes visible under the fat. In theory, your body fat percentage can drop from ""overweight"" to ""athletic"" without you needing to lose a single pound of fat if you gain an appropriate amount of muscle instead.

However, muscle gain is a much slower process than fat loss. [Studies](https://inbodyusa.com/blogs/inbodyblog/how-much-muscle-can-you-gain-in-a-month/) show that a sustainable weight-training program will allow men to put on about 0.5 pounds of muscle per month, while women can put on about 0.15 pounds per month.

It will take you a very long time to put on a visible quantity of muscle mass, and to make things worse, if you are not meticulous with your clean bulk, you will gain fat as well.

All of this is to say that cutting will gain you visible results faster than bulking. You will have achieved a tangible intermediate goal, which is better for your morale over your long-term fitness quest.",changemyview

I personally don't believe this argument is realistic since studies show a sharp spike in greenhouse gases and global temperature over the past 100 years uncharacteristic with any long-term trend, however that isn't the point of this CMV. I won't be responding to comments about what \*\*causes\*\* climate change, and I encourage any discussions to avoid that topic as well. The point is that, no matter what, the governments and corporations of the world should be investing more into sustainable technology than they already are.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*\*Even if\*\* climate change is largely or wholly natural, I still believe we should be doing more about it. If we accept that it's going to be happening no matter what then we should still be investing money, time, and expertise into moving away from using hydrocarbons and taking \*proactive\* steps to reduce the future impacts of things like forest fires and hurricanes that have been growing more and more prevalent. Weather disasters, rising sea levels, and record high temperatures are things that are observably happening more and more frequently. Regardless of the cause we need to deal with these problems before they become insurmountable. We need better forestry programs. better disaster planning, coastline protection, improved flood defenses, and ways for farming to adapt to cope with summers that are growing longer and hotter.

&#x200B;

\*\*Even if\*\* investing in green energy and sustainable resources not derived from fossil fuels won't prevent climate change we should still pursue them as a more sustainable world will always be better to live in than the same world with finite resources. An unfortunate consequence of supply-and-demand capitalism is that if a desirable (or even vital) commodity is in short supply, it will inevitably end up being exploited by whoever first corners the market. Now I'm not suggesting that some Star Trek style post-scarcity socialist utopia is just around the corner; some of these things will take decades or even centuries to perfect, but it's never too early to start. It seems obvious to me that with a degrading habitat and depleting resources humanity needs to find new ways to do it's old tricks.

&#x200B;

We can develop new, efficient ways of extracting resources without fundamentally changing the way we live. For example if electric cars were as good in every way as combustion cars then we wouldn't notice a difference, but we'd have removed one of our dependencies on a finite resource. If all our electricity came from renewables, we could still surf the web, go to the cinema, use our mobile phones, but we'd remove the risks of increasing energy prices as fossil fuels inevitable become more scarce. By moving away from a scarcity economy we'd also remove a major factor in global political and military conflict; resource acquisition. More resources -> less demand -> less need for competition. It's a bit of a meme by this point, but I don't think anyone can disagree that Western intervention in the Middle-East was largely motivated by securing oil supplies. This, like Chinese investment in sub-Saharan Africa, is behaviour that stretches right back to European colonialism. The world moved away from colonialism after improved technologies levelled the field and allowed for national self-determination. Similarly, new technologies allowing cheaper living will actually give a way for the existing public pressure surrounding sustainability to enact the change it wants to see.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Some counterpoints I anticipate seeing:

&#x200B;

\> This sounds expensive, we need to focus on ""now"" problems like the economy, social justice, and world peace.

Yes, true, but I don't think these are mutually exclusive goals. New infrastructure technology, from steam power to mass transport to computer chips, if properly applied has \*always\* benefited the economy whether it was intended to or not. All we need is for everyone to agree to invest in and use it; if nobody had bothered to invest in microchips we wouldn't be living in a digital age right now. Renewables promise entire new professional and industrial sectors that can benefit everyone. It also requires a shift in political thinking away from selfishly centralising power and towards ""legislative altruism"" (I made that up but you get what I mean). This is the same root issue as with social justice; poverty, systemic racism, rehabilitation, education, etc.; and so these two issues again go hand-in-hand. I've already outlined how more resources means less conflict, and I think this applies easily to homeland security for everything from terrorism to illegal immigration (again, this CMV isn't about whether immigration poses a security threat). Simply put, if resources are more available then less nations will step on each others' toes and less people will need to seek life in other countries.

&#x200B;

\> This should come from the people; you can't legislate societal change, it needs to come from the ground up.

Sure, the pressure for change works best when it's from the people, but the people cannot enact those changes themselves. The resource consumption of one person in their lifetime pales compared to what a corporation burns through in a day. I have no control over these corporations; the free market does not apply because \*\*there are no alternatives\*\*. I can't boycott the oil industry because I need to drive my car to get to work, everything is made of plastic, and most of my electricity comes from power stations. Small scale eco-communes exist, true, and these demonstrate that such a society is broadly possible, but to make it feasible for everyone we need top-down legislation and funding from governments to enforce the change.

&#x200B;

\> New technologies will just create new monopolies favouring whichever country/company develops it first.

Speaking as someone working in engineering academia, for any given problem there are dozens to hundreds of teams working on it simultaneously. They don't all just stop when one finishes, because any solution can always be improved and innovated upon. The one concession I would make is that countries who have more resources \*now\* will be better able to make use of these new technologies and that poorer nations risk being left behind. This is where that legislative altruism I mentioned rejoins the party; in this instance I think richer economies have a moral duty to help elevate poorer economies. You could say this is simply colonialism in a different guise, and you'd probably be right, but frankly that's a short-term price I'd happily pay for a long-term sustainable future.

CMV: A middle class person is better off living in a small EU country than in US,5069,j7v3xf,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j7v3xf/cmv_a_middle_class_person_is_better_off_living_in/,749,2020-10-09 16:13:04,"This is not really US bashing, it is actually related to a personal choice, and by explaining my thought process I think I am able to represent an average person here (don't get me wrong, my ego is big and I don't think of my self as average in most cases, but in terms of lifestyle and class I certainly think I am.) I also don't want to discuss Trump at all. I recently had a debate with someone who still thinks US provides the most to people who live in it, so I want to see what can US give me that would make me want to live there instead of my (very unimpressive) Country.

I am Croatian, our country had a war, is now in EU, our politicians are generally incompetent, we are no economic force, our salaries are not impressive. I find it beautiful, but I also find US beautiful and I won't be discussing emotional reasons to live in either place here. Just saying, I'm not from Scandinavia or Germany to rightfully brag about doing things ""better"" than the US, but most European countries (even those not in EU) share certain privileges. 

I am university educated with a Masters at the moment, it didn't cost me anything, and I have work experience in one unrelated but very solid field. However while this maybe puts me a bit above average, I am not an entrepreneur (like most people aren't) and have no interest or ability to run my own business. I also don't need to make tons of money. I of course appreciate a good salary and want to be able to live a sustainable, self reliant, comfortable and safe lifestyle  but for me that means - owning an apartment/place to live, not having debt, having retirement savings, being protected in cases of sickness or medical emergencies, being able to pay bills, go out, take courses in something that interests me, travel affordably, have IKEA furniture and wear H&M. Nothing extravagant, because I realistically don't need it and it doesn't motivate me. 

I also care about work life balance A LOT. I want to have free time for myself, for my interests, for people. I don't want my job dominating my life. Most people don't. We need time off, we need vacations. I fear that if I go to US, I will lose generous vacation time and work will be much more intense. I would probably not have a month off or more every year and limitless sick days. I will make more money, but everything will be more expensive and I will desperately depend on my job for medical insurance (so if I quit or lose my job for a short while, I can't get sick?).  I'd rather be unemployed somewhere where it doesn't threaten my livelihood than working somewhere where I can't afford to quit. 

&#x200B;

This brings me to medical insurance. I do understand that while US doesn't have a free health care, you are often insured through work? But many are not. I saw tons of people on reddit explain how much they got into debt because of an accident that involved emergency (so not like they had a choice not to go).  It also seems that your insurance plan might not cover many things if you're not rich which leads to so many movie and show plots where characters have to do something crazy to afford healthcare for themselves or loved one. I hear the argument about being able to choose your doctors but none of it makes sense to me, what do I need to choose for? If I am sick, the ONLY thing I want is that I am helped and cured and that I don't have to worry about money during that. People still have private providers if they want to pay for some additional comforts - but even those private providers aren't that expensive in comparison because they still have to make sense to people who are getting it for free. 

Now, I don't want kids which saves me a lot of problems. But the majority of people do, so let's also explore what that would mean. If I wanted to have a kid in my shitty country, I would not need to be rich. My medical expenses would be covered. Kindergardens are cheap or even free (I will mention, but not focus on the cultural element too where most of us get tremendous help from our families allowing people more free time, but to an extent that is not a guarantee for all). I head that childcare in US is so expensive that often one parent has to stop working because they simply can't manage it. So in the country where without money you're nothing, one person has to lose their job and the other has to better not end up losing it no matter how bad it gets. 

Then we'd have t think about school. Public schools in my country and a lot of Europe are better than private schools, and poor kids and rich kids attend them together (usually when rich kids go to a private school its because they weren't good students in a public school). So the equal opportunity is literally there. I wouldn't have to save ridiculous sums I'd much rather have in my own savings for college because a kid will go into college by merit. And if I do need to put my kid in a private college because they were bad academically and I don't want them to do a trade school (which btw lead to very good employment opportunities and should not be dismissed), it won't be expensive because again, it's competing with free stuff. 

Americans will now say that at least their higher education is the best in world. Ok. I think our free universities are very good too but objectively yes, expensive private universities can afford state of the art facilities and renowned professionals who come and teach. But the class plays such a huge role in where someone will end up. There are some scholarships to keep up the appearance but from what I understand many of the US public schools are very poor quality (or the quality ones require you to live in a certain limited location), while rich kids get prepared from early on. A good public school student who maybe won't get a special scholarship because they aren't extraordinary in sport (what does that have to do with anything?) or in any other way that will get huge attention will be worse off than a bad private school student, because in the end while merit might help a small minority, money will help everyone to get their place even if they're not academically gifted at all. It seems to me that these amazing colleges just serve to give credibility to the already rich who will go on being rich anyway (so that they can pretend that they're actually smart cause they went to Harvard), and maintain the illusion that even the poor/middle class can do it if they work hard enough. 

My final point I know the least about is property. In my country most of us own property - poor, middle class, upper middle class, all have some property they inherited or are able to buy apartments for their kids. During the socialist time many people were given property - my grandpa used his completely average middle class Yugoslavia salary to buy each of his kids an apartment, a big house on the seaside etc. I understand that maybe this was an extraordinary situation and market isn't like that, but I also don't understand why Americans need huge houses and cars and debt either. Maybe this is more lifestyle issue than something that belongs here. But the debt part - I understand you are forced to use a credit card in america or else you don't get access to housing loans. So a person who doesn't buy into the whole consumerism and wants to save money is actually penalized the one time they need to loan to buy property and stop renting. 

You will point out that none of these things are free and we all pay more taxes. Sure, but again, for an average person's average salary with the taxes deducted from it, we get healthcare, education, retirement, care in cases of emergencies and good social programmes as a support through hard times. If your goal is to be an entrepreneur, get filthy rich and don't want too many limitations or taxes because you don't have to give a shit, maybe US is the place for you. 

But most people, including smart and educated people, want a good life. They want balance, they want to be safe, they want their family to be taken care of, they want the freedom to quit a bad job or get sick without going bankrupt, they want time to themselves and people in their lives. i just don't see how the US provides that.

Tl;dr I don't think US is a good place for most people to live in because it forces you to have to be rich to have a decent life. I don't really see what I'd get as an average/middle class person in the US and think life for that group is better in almost any European country (including small, economically weaker ones). I don't think pursuit of money is really a choice in that context and i don't think it's a great way to live a life",changemyview
CMV: Government jobs creation programs are useless because of Say's law.,6,j7seyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j7seyy/cmv_government_jobs_creation_programs_are_useless/,21,2020-10-09 12:16:08,"There's this sort of prevalent common sense assumption that unemployment rates could increase indefinitely as if we'd find ourselves in a world where half the population could be unemployed and there'd never be any market correction. Assuming that society actually does want to extract value from these unemployed workers and society isn't content to let them subsist, wouldn't some business firm find a productive use for them? All the employed people who are sick of their cousins mooching off them could employ them as house cleaners, or perhaps more abstractly, there would be an incentive for existing business to tighten up quality simply because it would be possible to do so, to deploy more workers to improve quality of service.

It seems to me that a lot of business these days cut corners a lot. I've heard that the customer service when you walk into a retail store in Japan is miles ahead of what you find in America. Having an glut of workers in the marketplace could help patch up the potholes in the economy.

I suppose my idea falls apart when you consider that a minimum wage would prevent that from happening.

Either way, it seems to me, that massive unemployment is like, the goal of a utopian post scarcity civilization. Right? The whole point of work is to not work. Like at what point in a world with 50% unemployment do the workers not look at their unemployed cousins, look at their work schedule, look back at their unemployed cousins, and not connect the dots?

\*\*\* EDIT\*\*\*

Thanks for the discussion guys.  **Δ**  s for everyone. I have abandoned my poorly thought out idea that Say's law applied to labor would make government jobs program's unnecessary. One, because Say's law doesn't apply to labor. And two because Say's law is not valid.

Sorry about the confusion, about me not understanding Say's law in the first place. I thought it might be more fun to sort of put my own musings out there. They were sorta informed by the vague understanding, and you guys helped me fill in the gaps.

So now my understanding is that yes, free market principles would of course correct a depression in the long run, but that correction might not look much like what was before. That plus the chance that it might create years of economic suffering makes a free market correction less preferable to a Keynesian approach. The basic idea being that world has become a lot more complicated than Say's day, and that those modern complications make Say's theory less and less useful.

God damn it. Now I'm back where I started.

Okay, well I think I better understand Say's law now, so I concede my thesis is false, and for that reason, I consider this specific issue resolved, and I suggest we wrap up this forum. Go ahead and post any concluding ideas if you like, and we'll chat econ in the next one.",changemyview

"CMV: Pat Riley, Phil Jackson and Joe Torre were mediocre coaches that benefited from great talent and wouldn't be remembered if it weren't for that talent.",0,j7sd0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j7sd0i/cmv_pat_riley_phil_jackson_and_joe_torre_were/,21,2020-10-09 12:12:02,"It has been an unending source of fury when I hear people talk about the great coaches of the past, and include Joe Torre, Pat Riley or Phil Jackson. I don't think any of them were particularly good coaches, and I don't think they would be remembered as anything other than trivia questions if they did not have the casts around them that they had.

Pat Riley, as coach of the Lakers in the 80s, had Magic Johnson in his prime, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar while he was still dominant, James Worthy, BYron Scott, A.C. Green, and others. That lineup would have won 4 NBA Championships with a variety of coaches. As coach of the Lakers, he went to 7 NBA finals, winning 4. This is a great statistic, but more based on the players he had on that team than his actual ability as a coach. He coached 6 players who went on to be inducted to the Hall of Fame with Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabar, Bob McAdoo, James Worthy, Jamaal Wilkes, and Vlade Divac. That level of talent on a roster should get you the NBA title at least 4 times. His coaching record with the Lakers was 533-194, from 1981-1990.

However, when Riley went to the Knicks in 1991, he was not as lucky. In his 4 years there, he compiled a record of 223-105, which is a good record. However, he had Patrick Ewing, Charles Oakley, Allan Houston, John Starks and others on the roster that were excellent players. The key moment from his time as Knicks coach was in Game 7 of the 1994 NBA Finals, a series the Knicks had led 3-2. John Starks, a notorious really hot or really cold player, went 2 for 18 in shooting that night, including missing 11 out of 13 three-point attempts in a game 7 the Knicks lost by 6 points. Riley had other options on the bench in Greg Anthony or Hubert Davis that could have come in, but kept having the Knicks desperately feed the ball to an obviously out of rhythm John Starks throughout the 4th quarter as they tried catching up. It's a huge stain on a coach to get caught in a sunken cost like that and not change it up.

Then Riley goes to the Heat, and that's where I think his actual coaching ability is put on display. From 1995-2003, he went 354-270. That isn't exactly stellar. He lost every season early in the playoffs or he didn't make them. He was forced to resign as coach, but stayed on as president. The Heat bring in Shaquille O'Neal to pair with Dwayne Wade, he forces Stan Van GUndy out as coach in mid-season so he can take over the team in 2005, and they win the NBA Championship. He lasts 2 more seasons, and then he's out again. His coaching record for the Heat the second time around was 100-125, which obviously is pretty bad.

Phil Jackson is, to me, the most overrated coach in NBA history, and possibly sports history. He coached the Bulls from 1989-98, compiling a 545-193 record, which is excellent. Then he coached the Lakers from 1999-2011, with a 610-267 record. On it's face, it's a stellar career as a coach. However, he never won without marquis players running his offense, typically fielding a lineup with more stars than the rest of the league could muster on a single team. 

The Bulls obviously had Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. However, Jerry Krause, the GM, handed him excellent role players on those teams with John Paston, Bill Cartwright, Luc Longley, Horace Grant, Steve Kerr, Toni Kukoc and Dennis Rodman. A guy off the streets could come in and *accidentally* win 2 Championships with that crew. He won 6 Championships with the Bulls, but none without Jordan in the lineup. The 2 seasons Jordan was trying to play baseball, Jackson made early round exits from the playoffs.

Then, with the Lakers, he had Kobe Bryant, one of the greatest to play the game. He walked in on the youth of one of the greatest players to step on the court. He also had Shaquille O'Neal, another Hall of Famer, along with Robert Horry, John Salley, Glen Rice, Horace Grant (again) and others. He couldn't always manage Kobe Bryant, who routinely feuded with teammates, but he still won another 5 Championships with a star-studded cast, taking a year off in 2004-05. With the cast he had, though, he SHOULD have won that many championships. That's basically just doing his job, to me. He never made a subpar team excel. Any time his teams had adversity, they came up short, because he couldn't manage it or defuse it. His time as an executive with the Knicks was a disaster, and dispelled any rumors about his amazing basketball IQ transferring to organizational ability, something that is usually the hallmark of a great coach (see Bill Belichick).

Then Joe Torre. Ahhhh, Joe Torre, that most maddening of mediocre managers elevated to greatness due to events outside of his responsibility.He had a managing career of 30 seasons, with a record of 2326-1997, winning just over half of his games. If you subtract his time with the Yankees, he has a losing record as a manager. He only went to the World Series with the Yankees, with a 4-2 record. However, his playoffs record for series wins as a manager was 4-8. 

During the best run, from 1996-2000, he won 4 out of 5 World Series. However, he inherited a young Derek Jeter just coming into his own, Mariano Rivera, Jorge Posada, Mike Mussina, Roger Clemens, David Cone, David Wells, Paul O'Neill, Scott Brosius, Alex Rodriguez, Alfonso Soriano, CC Sabathia, Tino Martinez, and more. Every season, he started with one of the top-3 rosters that money could buy. If he lost 8 playoff series during that time, and only won 4 world series, then, to me, he was more of a failure as a manager than a success. He also oversaw the only playoff loss following a team having a 3-0 series lead. 

His other stints as manager were poor, at best. He had limited success with the Dodgers, but never went to a World Series. He had losing records with the Mets and Cardinals, and scratched out winning records with the Braves and Dodgers. 

So change my view that these were actually good coaches, and not mediocre coaches that benefited greatly from exceptional talent that no other team in their respective sport could field at that time.",changemyview

A person's privileges can include being white, able-bodied, male, cis, heterosexual, etc. but  others can be at least as impactful and get overlooked all the time, like having had a good childhood, caring and educated parents, financial stability, being ""naturally"" attractive, self-confident, outgoing,  charismatic, likeable etc. without having to make a huge effort, above average IQ, being born in an environment with the right personal connections and being lucky meeting the right people, being born in a rich country, being physically and mentally healthy and neurotypical, being born in your current country of residence and/or speaking the language  fluently, genetics that do not predispose to significant health problems, not having to care for a sick relative, being encouraged early on to choose the career that matches one's skills and interests and  being given related opportunities, ...

""James Bond just doesn't work as a black character."" 

""Hermione wasn't written as brown."" 

So on and so forth. These are examples of the sort of anti-racebending positions that seem to me untenable in Christian-founded cultures, granting the caveat in the title.

If it is acceptable to alter the perceived ethnicity of Jesus to make it more palatable, relevant, or sympathetic for a particular (local?) audience -- Jesus, who is the Son of God, and God himself -- then changing the ethnicities of fictional characters must be fair game, because what are fictional characters compared to God? If you are Christian, then the answer is ""nothing,"" and something that is good enough for God ought to be good enough for a fictional character. If you are non-Christian, then the answer is ""exactly the same, just another character in our cultural pantheon,"" and you should treat the underlying concept in both examples the same way.

And if it is acceptable to alter the perceived ethnicity of Jesus, then it would also seem to be implicitly understood that Jesus's ethnicity does not fundamentally change anything about him. Which, to those of Christian faith or culture, should be another blow to the argument that racebending a character *must* fundamentally alter them. 

To clarify the difference in the above arguments, in the first I'm saying that Jesus is so important (or ""culturally relevant"" for non-believers) in Christian cultures, that anything that does not seem like a transgression against Jesus can't be a transgression against a fictional character. And in the second, I'm saying that Jesus is so important (or ""culturally relevant"" for non-believers) in Christian cultures, that getting him ""wrong"" would be at least as bad as getting any fictional character wrong, and thus Jesus's whitewashing demonstrates that changing one's ethnicity is actually very trivial.

*Success or failure of individual instances of racebending should still be judged on a case by case basis, just as the success or failure of any other aspect of an adaptation. I am not saying that because the whitewashing of Jesus was ""well-received"" by certain people, those people must receive every instance of racebending just as well. In other words, execution will vary, but the concept is either acceptable or it is not. 

If someone believes that racebending is never acceptable and that efforts ought to be made to de-whitewash Christian icons in Christian cultures, then for the purposes of this CMV, I have no quarrel with that position.",changemyview

They can both ask each candidate a few questions, which are pre screened by the committee so there are no personal attacks on family and such. This would be the round where they can call out the others policies, voting habits, bad faith statements, etc. 

I think this would dramatically enhance our debates and make it so the American people actually gain value from these debates. Obviously these are weird times, but that doesn’t mean we need to just have hour and a half long pointless arguments. The first Presidential debate was one of the worst things I have ever seen. 

We need moderators who are not afraid to cut off candidates, and call them out. No more “thank you for this question, but let me talk about something else for two minutes”. These are serious issues people want to know about. We don’t want to hear you give us the same 4 answers for an hour and a half. 

Candidates should be forced to give answers relate to the questions. Otherwise what is the point of these debates?

EDIT: This blew up way more than I thought it would. I did my best to answer as many responses as I could. I appreciate the good conversations.

And I Want an American person perspective on this to expand my view. If it changed my view a little bit I give a delta. Anyway lets start with the discussion. 

I know for example there is a ""winner takes it all"" system in some or most States so I understand Why it can be seen as wasteful in that perspective.
But I don't think voting for 3rd party is wasteful and here is just an example of my reasoning Why.

(You can skip this phrase if you Want my summary) Lets you are out eating at a party until someone decides to order and ask everyone What they Want. (There are 12 People at the party)
6 People Want sea food, 5 People Want asian food and the last person Want italian food.
Now obviously they get sea food this time and more likely asian food next time but they still think about what that last guy wanted and maybe do a homemade pizza with Spice and fishes on it to compensate for his choice to make the italian food loving guy more comfortable to be with either of them.

Now beside putting out my cringy example let me summarize with this I think speaking out your political opinion of what policies you support and that you are comfortable with is better than voting out of lesser bad of the two sure you most likely Will lose but you can make the 2 most popular parties to reconsider what policies they should adopt by looking at people who voted for 3rd party to more likely get voted by them next election so how is it wasteful? =3

EDIT: After looking at many great arguments Why 3rd party vote is wasteful made me change my view that I can understand Why it is wasteful but I think it is still unfortunate that 3rd party is obsolete rather than useful of projecting their policies into the 2 biggest parties of USA",changemyview

CMV: Most regulations on children's TV are stupid and unnecessary.,1,j794c8,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j794c8/cmv_most_regulations_on_childrens_tv_are_stupid/,20,2020-10-08 16:00:26,"To me, the only regulations that should be place on TV aimed at children are:

* No foul language
* No explicit sexual content/references
* No graphic violence/gore
* No drugs or alcohol

That is it. Anything more is too much. We already have a ratings system that parents are supposed to use to help determine if a show on TV is age appropriate too:

* TV-Y: ages 2-6
* TV-Y7: ages 7 and up
* TV-G: all ages
* TV-PG: all ages, parental guidance suggested
* TV-14: ages 14 and up
* TV-MA: ages 17 and up

This has been in effect since 1997, and it is your responsibility as a parent or caregiver to pay attention to these ratings and regulate your kids' TV watching accordingly.

But there's one form of regulation that I can't help but scratch my head about: the kidvid rules. First implemented in 1991 and made harsher in 1997, these rules apply to broadcast stations (you know, those local channels you can get with antenna with names that start with ""W"" or ""K"") and basically say that:

* You have to broadcast 3 hours of educational/informational shows each week.
* You can't have more than 10.5 minutes of ads per half-hour on weekends and 12 minutes of ads per half-hour on weekdays.
* You can't air ads for any commercial product based on or tied to the show that's currently airing (i.e. no Spider-Man toy ads can air during an episode of Spider-Man)

Let me go ahead and explain to you everything wrong with all of these:

* Educational/Informational: Why? Kids already have to go to school and do homework, they don't need more learning forced on their TV shows. Besides, PBS' daytime lineup has always been packed full of educational shows for young children, and Nickelodeon and Disney also have shows designed to appeal to and educate a preschool audience. The demand has already been met, no need to force it on everyone.
* Ad time limit: This one is stupid because everyone was already following this anyway. TV shows for children typically run at 21-26 minutes, with 4-9 minutes reserved for ad breaks. Some networks (like PBS or Disney Channel) don't even air ads at all.
* No ads for products based on the show: Again, why? Nobody's forcing kids to buy these products, and the parents are the ones who have to say yes or no anyway. There's a lot of criticism about cartoons based on toys being half-hour commercials. I don't see it that way. I see the show as just a show for kids to enjoy, and the toys as just a bonus thing that's also available to enjoy.

Those rules in particular are the reason broadcast networks don't air children's shows anymore. There used to be multiple blocks aimed at kids on broadcast TV:

* Fox Kids/FoxBox/4KidsTV (Fox)
* Disney's One Saturday Morning/ABC Kids (ABC)
* Disney's One Too (UPN)
* Kids 'WB/The CW4Kids (WB/CW)
* The Disney Afternoon (Syndication)

All of them were known for producing quality shows that children could enjoy and were safe for kids to watch. But thanks to those kidvid rules, they all suffered immensely. They had to either shoehorn in educational shows that were out of place with what kids wanted to watch, or have their slots taken by syndicated science and nature shows so that stations could meet their E/I quota. The very day these rules started, Nickelodeon shot past all these blocks in the ratings, because cable channels like Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network are not bound to these rules and are free to be awesome instead. Now PBS is the only broadcast network that even still bothers to air children's shows, as they're the only ones not affected by these kidvid rules due to having already done those things on their own for years.

Show me some positive effects of these rules, I dare you.",changemyview
"CMV: As a middle eastern/american woman, I have trouble understanding why POC crave stories that represent them explicitly with appearance and culture.",70,j78cb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j78cb1/cmv_as_a_middle_easternamerican_woman_i_have/,51,2020-10-08 14:47:37,"Before I start: Please understand, I do not find it stupid that other people desire to see themselves in media, I simply can't relate to the desire, and feel confused about it, which is why I'm writing.

Am I missing something?

Maybe it's because I was born in america and struggle with identifying with my culture already, but I don't really see myself in characters that look like me and are from the same culture. I see myself in characters that behave like me and have similar struggles and journeys. I've been this way since I was a child. When I was a kid I liked Snow White because she was nice to animals and I liked being nice to animals too. I identified with Robin from Teen Titans because I felt I shared his obsessive and fearful concerns in stressful situations. Snow White is a white woman and Robin is a male white teenager. I still felt like I identified with them. Lately people around me, friends and family who are POC, are talking about how they had no characters to relate to growing up because they didn't have any POC representation. This is perplexing to me.
I write stories of my own and I write characters the same way I experienced them- based on their personalities and struggles. Race barely comes to mind when I write them, but creators lately are expressing concern over needing to diversify and not create a cast of only one (particularly white) race. This is odd for me, and it feels forced to create a character on a race basis. 
With the exception of children's perspectives, where I have seen a lot of evidence showing that seeing characters that look like themselves in media is important for a developing mind, why is representation crucial for certain POC to feel that they connect to a character? I would love to hear from people.",changemyview

This isn’t to say that movies that are based on true stories can’t be accurate, but that because there is no threshold for how much of a film needs to be accurate for it to be considered actually based on a true story, so it might as well not be used. All that an audience knows is that there was some event that inspired the movie, but they will have to do independent research to see how accurate it is.

CMV: The threat that rich people or businesses will leave a state at the notion of tax increases should be signaling that citizens are ultimately subservient to them,809,j76t61,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j76t61/cmv_the_threat_that_rich_people_or_businesses/,272,2020-10-08 12:41:24,"I'm not really here to argue whether the argument that businesses will leave a state when they are taxed too highly is valid. I want to argue under the assumption that this argument is fact.

I live in Washington, and right now one issue we're having is Boeing leaving Washington and moving to South Carolina. I have seen many arguments, not about Boeing specifically but about businesses in general, that increased state taxes on businesses should be avoided so businesses continue employing citizens of their state. While I'm not comfortable arguing that one way or the other (noted above), I can't help but feel that this speaks larger to the idea that we, as citizens, 'owe something' to large businesses.

Obviously, in some sense, we DO owe something to large businesses, as they help stimulate our economy via jobs. However, countless studies and shown that productivity has risen at a greater rate over the past several years than wages have. This says to me that a given employee is producing relatively more revenue for their company than their company is paying them. Given this discrepancy, and given how cost of living has also been going up significantly in this time, it's clear that businesses (in general) are not properly compensating their employees for  their work.

Because this money is being centralized into large businesses and not their employees, additional taxes on businesses (and more wealthy citizens) seems like an obvious step.  But with these businesses having the ability to move to a more ""business-friendly,"" citizens are stuck either working jobs which do not compensate them enough, or not having a job at all. Thus, we are functionally subservient to the wishes of large businesses to keep employment rates at a reasonable rate. I understand moving is a COSTLY endeavor and is likely only taken in extreme circumstances, but the fact that it can and does happen means this is a fear that must be respected.

This wasn't a view I had properly thought through prior to writing this so I'm sure I'm wrong somewhere, so please change my view!

EDIT 2: So my view has sufficiently been changed, or at least challenged enough that I need to go mull it over for a while. so here's what I'll say to those I didn't respond to:

1. I see how my argument here logically concludes with the idea that businesses should not be allowed to move of their own accord. I didn't want this to be where my view ended up, but as I've read more replies I'm starting to see there isn't really a way around this sort of authoritarian approach. I still *don't like* the current state of affairs, but given that I'm not able to find an alternative that doesn't result in authoritarianism, I think it's safe to say that my view has issues.

2. Ultimately, I think the answer here is regulations at the Federal level, not in the sense of ""prevent these companies from acting autonomously"" but rather making sure the labor force isn't being exploited or unfairly compensated, which I probably should have included in my original CMV but did not think of until I posted it.",changemyview

First of all, it's a huge risk for someone with mental illnesses that causes them to be delusional, paranoid, eccentric, maniacal, sociopathic, psychopathic or  impulsive to be running anything. These people are unpredictable and would often make rash decisions. These people might be seen as weird, crazy, or stupid. This is especially the case if they can't get their symptoms and mentality under control.  Mental illnesses that cause people to be this way include schizophrenia, personality disorders, psychopathy, and sociopathy.  These people may be intelligent, but it's a risk to put them in charge due to their mentality and mental illnesses. 

Secondly, it's also a huge risk to put people with developmental disorders such as ADHD or autism in charge(although the risk is less compared to someone with a mental illness) Although people with autism usually don't make rash decisions, they might end up being camera shy and might struggle when it comes to stuff such as persuasion and negotiation which is important for leaders.  People with ADHD are impulsive and typically have trouble taking in info due to being unable to focus.  Again, these people may be intelligent, but also impaired.  

Thirdly, theirs's a huge risk to put someone with dementia or cognitive disabilities in charge as they're unable to remember, understand, retain, and apply information. They are also unable to think quickly. Sometimes being a leader requires intelligence.

This post struck me deeply because a large portion of the comments were directed to justify the importance of the Roman influence over Europe, the rich cultural development brought by the Goth but to demonize in all ways the Arab incursion on the Peninsula.

""Arabs killed everyone who wasn´t Christian, pillaged and forced their beliefs in the local population"" was the most common argument.

When asked what they thought about the *Spanish conquest and colony in America*, which was pretty much that (killed you if you´re not Christian, pillage and force you to become like them, plus rapping and stealing all we had) the argument was **""but we took CIVILIZATION to them!!""**

*How do you define what is civilization?* Most people refer to the origin of the word itself, coming from the Greek *civitas*, which was the term used to call their political divisions, and which later derived in words like city (english), cidade(portuguese/gallego), ciudat (catala), ciudad (spanish).

Yet, if this is the origin of civilization, what happens with the huge human settlements in America, Africa or Asia? Why aren't those considered Civilizations?

Haven´t you noticed that whenever people talk about Mayans or Aztecs is always ""Mayan Culture"", ""the  Aztec Culture"" or even ""the pre-Columbian tribes"", like if the words Mayan or Aztec, or Inca or Navajo and the word Civilization were complete opposite and could not be together in a sentence.

Weren´t those advanced people who had arts, scientific advancements in medicine, agriculture, architecture, mathematics and a myriad of other fields the very definition of civilization?

I don’t think I have faced the same discrimination of people assuming I’m a threat just by looking at me (I am smol, squishy and essentially glow in the dark I am so pale) but I have dealt with people making a lot of assumptions about who I am as a person based on my skin color, and being bullied (presumably) because of that. 

Anyway, I am super passionate about the civil rights movement happening right now, but I don’t know what my place should be in the movement and I am relatively frozen with indecision. In the before times, I was an event organizer and marketing director for nerd events with over 35k people, so I know I have real life skills in organization and getting the word out. 

Since the BLM 2.0 movement started, I have seen a lot of arguments that things like the Wall of Moms is white saviorism, protests shouldn’t be led by white people, white people should step aside and let black counterparts cover the protests etc. some of the people making these arguments are people of color, and some are not. I (think) I understand the logic in their argument, but alternatively I think that white people who want a more equitable society should absolutely be on the front lines and should use their privilege to protect people of color in their community, and are obligated to do so as people with an unfair leg up. If a member of the press has a huge and sympathetic audience, shouldn’t it be ideal that they cover a protest, even or especially if they are white? I think just about every voice talking about this honestly and in good faith has a place and a positive effect on convincing more people that change needs to happen - it shouldn’t matter or should be even more persuasive that people who benefit from the current structure of society have had enough too.

I also know I am well informed on many subjects related to this movement and have been ravenously consuming the news, history, opinions from activists and leaders, political science and science/statistics like it’s my job for the last 4 years.  

I do not want to hurt the movement in any way and want to optimize my ability to help but I can’t get past this belief that I should be on the organizing end / starting something within my group of contacts rather than just being a person who shows up.",changemyview
"CMV: liberals/progressives use and promote ineffective slogans (BLM, defund the police, etc)",20,j6zqe1,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j6zqe1/cmv_liberalsprogressives_use_and_promote/,100,2020-10-08 05:22:27,"disclaimer: i'm generally a political conservative, sympathetic to many progressive issues, and vehemently anti-trump

in this highly polarized environment people across the country have been motivated to go out and protest, raise awareness of issues, and fight for what they believe in -- i think that's all great. 

however, towards that end, many progressive and liberal people have promoted the use of slogans that imo are ineffective at best and counterproductive at worst. 

messaging is important. the point of a slogan is to get across an idea in a short/catchy way that can be spread quickly and easily. but if the effect is mis-interpretation by people who hear it to the point where they don't agree, it's not a good slogan. if it requires extra explanation to really understand the idea, it's not a good slogan. 

let's take defund the police. from my understanding, most ppl who say this mean redirecting some of the funding that goes to front-line officers and using it to fund jobs like social workers and counselors to reduce the potential for unnecessary violence on the policed population. i think that is an idea worthy of investigation and trial. but some random dude off the street is going to hear defund the police and think progressives want to get rid of police entirely. this has the effect of alienating a potential ally and give talking points to talking heads misrepresenting what progressives are actually championing. 

now some ppl might think the point is to be provocative and force conversations. but i feel that is a losing proposition when these days political discourse is often boiled down to a tweet, meme, or posterboard. when you try and reach out to conservatives who get their news from fb or fox news, these slogans are going to end up being more counterproductive than anything.

CMV: Introverted guys are more attractive to women than “alpha males”,0,j6yuec,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j6yuec/cmv_introverted_guys_are_more_attractive_to_women/,76,2020-10-08 04:34:36,"Every guy has that one friend who’s great with women. For me, it’s Andy. He always has a cool, cute girl in his life. The thing is, he’s pretty introverted, but that doesn’t stop him. In fact, it helps him. He’s self-aware, smart, and a great listener. Women love that. 

We were at a party one time, and this loud, brash guy was hitting on all the girls, talking AT them, not with them. (And striking out.) Meanwhile, I see Andy on a couch hitting it off with a gorgeous brunette, both of them snuggled up under a blanket. 

I’m a card-carrying introvert, too, and for a long time I was not good with girls. But I’ve found that women are more attracted to introverts than they are to outgoing “alpha males.” 

I once took a dating “boot-camp” where you meet women in bars, and the coach told me to be more alpha and brash. It didn’t work. I said obnoxious things, I felt weird, and women hated it. (One girl poured a glass of water down my shirt.) I had way better luck when I was just my normal, nerdy, introverted self. I worked hard at it, and in time I was having a better dating life than my outgoing buddies.

Introverted guys have 5 key dating advantages over the dudes with the lampshades on their heads. 

1: Introverts cultivate deeper connections. Why? I think because we’re good at one-on-one interactions, such as dates. Yes, socializing at a crowded bar is hard, but once we’re one-on-one, we’re playing to our strength. 

2: The “quiet ones” are great listeners. Women like to be truly heard, and listening comes naturally to the introverted brain. We talk WITH women, not at them.  

3: Introverts are self-aware and reflective. That kind of depth and intelligence is attractive. (It doesn’t hurt that we can seem a bit mysterious, which girls find intriguing.)

4: We’re self-contained, not needy. Extraverts need attention, but we don’t. 

5: Introverted men prefer “big” talk over small talk, and who doesn’t love stimulating conversation on a date?

I’m not saying that introverts GET the girls, only that once they approach or put themselves out there, their success rate is higher than the more extroverted, “alpha” types. Change my view.",changemyview
CMV: I support a decrease in city funding for homeless services,0,j6wcdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j6wcdz/cmv_i_support_a_decrease_in_city_funding_for/,62,2020-10-08 02:26:50,"Updated: Thanks for all the comments! I knew this post would make me seem like an awful human being, and I wanted to hear other perspectives. I do support funding for homeless services and long-term improvement for the homeless population. A federal strategy to provide homes is needed. However, we need the short term funding to help now.

My new question is: with significant municipal budget cuts due to decreased tax revenues this year, how do you balance the budget while supporting the homeless but not having to layoff city employees? Laying off city employees could put them in a financially difficult situation which may lead them to become homeless.

Some of the tradeoffs I'm thinking of. For example, it makes sense to eliminate all arts programs to fund the homeless. Because arts programs for kids and the community are an extra, compared to helping the homeless survive. However, more taxpayers benefit from the arts programs. 

I used to go to the library every other day. My friend is a librarian in the city library. She already takes a furlough day a month. Should she have to take more furlough days to fund the homeless? Because she will probably still live better than the homeless even if she took 2 furlough days a month. She doesn't get paid much already.

\-----

I live in a liberal city that used to allocate a significant amount of the city budget for homeless services. The homeless population has increased dramatically in the past decade. Many homeless people move to our city because of all the homeless services. Our city police force spends a significant amount of time on homeless issues: drug addiction, cleaning up encampments, homeless welfare. Women don't feel safe to walk, run or bike on certain mixed pedestrian and bicycle use paths because of assaults.

With decreased tax revenues this year, our city has decreased funding for homeless services. Many citizens have protested these changes. I personally am happy about these changes and hoping the homeless population will decrease so I can feel safer to walk and bike in the parts of town that were frequented with homeless people.

I am conflicted because I would support social services to improve the lives of the homeless for the long term. I want to know if there are better policy mechanisms to improve the long term welfare of the homeless.",changemyview

As a kid I was very friendly, always wanted to make some friends and share what I've learned with them and the world. I was very gullible and believed most of what people said to me. This unfortunately leads to me being manipulated easily into doing things. I was even molested by a fellow classmate. My other classmates humiliated me, made me feel worthless, and straight up shit on all my efforts to be friends. I never gave up hope, even though all of these horrible things happened to me. At the time, I was very religious and believed that god would make things right. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward 5th grade and things have not changed much. Although I met my new Ex best friend who we will call john. John was VERY manipulative and was just friends with me to steal my shit, but I didn't know this at the time. I trusted him with everything. I thought we truly had an understanding. He left our county about 5 moths after I met him. Devastated that I lost one of my only friends I looked for comfort. Unfortunately that also led to me being molested again from 6th all the way to 8th. At this point of my life I stopped trying to make friends, Forsook my religion and shut myself off from the world.

&#x200B;

Now I'm at my senior year of high school feeling bitter, lost. and alone. I want to get in the workforce and start moving up in the world. However, being social is an important skill that I must learn. I want to desperately shake this view of the world so I can end that chapter of my life so I can start anew.",changemyview

One of the common arguments that i see all the time is that it’s a violation of privacy. I don’t think this is true due to plain sight/view laws. These laws state that, if an object is in plain view, it’s basically fair game for law enforcement. For example, the plates on your car. If a cop is rolling down the street, they can run the plates of every single car parked on the street, if it doesn’t come up as stolen or anything of the sort, they move on. If it does, they recover the vehicle. 

My question is, why is this any different from facial recognition? If someone robs the store down the street, it should be put into the system, and in the same way cops of automatic license plate readers, they could do the same with your face, as it’s in plain sight. If there’s no hits, it’s like nothing happened. If there is, you can get stopped and detained for further investigation.

Are there any other arguments that refute mine? Am i misinterpreting the privacy argument?",changemyview

I was poor*er* at the time so I didn't have cable or a streaming service or a newspaper. I enjoyed r/politics because it was more than just stories about ***one*** man. There were everyday people on there sharing stories about politics at every level; local, state, federal and international. It was personal. 

Now, visit r/politics and sort by *TOP*. Is it fair to say that 90% of the posts are stories about ***one*** man, and almost all of them negative? If these posts are unsponsored, written by everyday people, then this ***one*** narrative is the dominating political thought of Reddit's population, which I would argue is probably a somewhat decent representation of the national population.

For ***one*** narrative to completely dominate an entire sub, especially one with a topic as broad as politics, tells me r/politics is no longer a healthy space for political discussion, and more worrisome: no longer a place for political progress. Saying Reddit's political knowledge and education has been reduced to Red v Blue would be a generous **understatement**. Reddit's political knowledge and education has been reduced to pro-Trump v anti-Trump.

Now, I have dug around a little bit and it seems like most responses for bashing on pedophiles have to do with the fact that people view it as a “sick attraction to our children”. Absolutely! But does a pedophile really make the conscious choice to be attracted to teenagers? 

For people who are attracted to the same sex, yeah you could say it’s more than just physical attraction.   But if kids are given the platform and lauded for coming out gay at 13/14 years old, why can’t they be trusted to be in a relationship with someone let’s say... 24/25? 

Finally, all I’m gonna say is that this is meant to be more thought provoking. I have no problem with how pedophiles are treated and gay people having the rights they have today.

CMV: Middle and upper middle class households are not rich,15,j6ub6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j6ub6g/cmv_middle_and_upper_middle_class_households_are/,86,2020-10-08 00:42:33,"The title essentially puts it out there easy peasy. I see posts about how we should “eat the rich” and “f all rich people” daily across the various social media sites I frequent. I’d like to state for the record that I support crazy high tax rates on the ultra-wealthy and mega-corporations.


My issue is that you will see people online refer to “those awful rich people,” but they are talking about the Karen at Target with a household income of $120,000 in a high cost of living area. Yes, they are not poor and not in poverty. That being said, calling them rich is dramatically overstating their financial situation. You have no idea how leveraged that family is with debt. Even if they are 100% debt-free, they are essentially as poor as everyone else when you focus on the true bad guys.


My argument is that unless you are a part of the top 1-3% of households (based on either income or net worth), you are not rich.


Labeling people who have just a little bit more than you as rich and evil only drives them away. When you say “tax the rich 70%” and then call Karen rich, she is going to assume you mean tax her more. She doesn’t want that. Few people do. While individuals should be smart enough to see that that marginal tax rate would never impact them, they are not. They jump to conclusions, get scared, and then vote Republican because “those dirty liberals are trying to take away your hard earned cash!”


This is a marketing issue for the left and it needs to be resolved if you hope to have true class unity and force the ultra-wealthy to pay their fair share.


Edit: I am specifically looking at the USA here. Also, that $120,000 was just an example. Please don’t get caught up on that number. You could be making $80,000 in a very rural area of a red state and be better off than $120,000 in a big city.",changemyview

I really don't think this needs much more explaining, so here's me trying to reach the 500 char requirement. I can pontificate at length below if you care. I said POTUS for clickbait, i mean all public office.

**TL;DR:**  **If it’s reasonable to discriminate against youth (constitutionally) it does not seem out of bounds to put a cap on how old one can be and still be elected President.**

35-65 seems reasonable. But that is really no scientific measure.

&#x200B;

Here's my overly long explanation you shouldn't bother to read...

It’s obvious that we are living longer and are generally healthier as we age than previous generations. But it’s also true that the vast majority of us slow down, both mentally and physically, as we head into our eighth decade. Why this fact of life should not be a matter of constitutional concern given the incredible sway, authorities, and importance of the American President is unclear. Age, after all, is already a factor in who can be sworn in as President. An individual has to be at least 35 years old to hold the office. Presumably, the Constitution’s drafters thought a certain level of maturity were more likely to be present with someone 35 than, say, 25.

Of course, there are always exceptions—as there is in any large group. However, common sense suggested to the Founders that exceptions should not be expected to be the rule. So, too, with individuals running for office who are well into their 70s. We all know individuals who are far more vigorous than their age would suggest. But we note their uniqueness precisely because it’s not to be expected. Genes and one’s lifestyle obviously matter. But in the absence of extensive gene testing and invasive lifestyle background checks, the rule of thumb probably should be that “older” means precisely that. If it’s reasonable to discriminate against youth, it does not seem out of bounds to put a cap on how old one can be and still be elected President.

One might object to this idea based on the fact that America’s longish presidential campaign seasons should be sufficient for voters to make an assessment about a candidate’s health and mental acuity. Yet, as we know, most Americans don’t actually pay as much attention as perhaps they should until the nominees have been chosen and November’s election closes in. Plus, those who do pay attention, who are the most engaged, are just as likely to overlook signs of serious aging—even senility—in their desire to see their favorite candidate win. Finally, even if a candidate’s medical records were totally open and exhaustive—which has never been the case—those records cannot guarantee a President’s future mental and physical health. Of course, this is true of younger Presidents as well. But electing individuals in their mid- to late 70s, with all the demands and pressures of today’s office, is more a roll of the dice than we ought to be comfortable with.",changemyview
"CMV: Society passes off the blame for rape, making the cycle easier to repeat.",0,j6tfc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j6tfc7/cmv_society_passes_off_the_blame_for_rape_making/,25,2020-10-07 23:56:21,"***No, I'm not going to say we need to blame the victims.***

I was reading an r/IAmA from a [victim of forced porn](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/e4wni0/i_am_a_victim_of_forced_pornography_by_the/https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/e4wni0/i_am_a_victim_of_forced_pornography_by_the/) (GirlsDoPorn).

There are a few things she said that I've heard quite a few times from victims of rape and sexual exploitation. I also noticed that a few people tried to blame women like her.

My viewpoint is that society is actually enabling rape by not fully blaming other parties that make these situations possible.

* **Age/Law**: The age of consent being under 18 in many places is murky waters, but let's focus on those who are 18 or older. I've heard in many testimonies, the age of the victim being an aggravating factor. If this really is the case that being 18 does not make you a sexually mature adult, why does the law not acknowledge this? If we allow victims of rape to use their youthfulness to establish why they were a victim, why does the law not have more protections for young adult women? Korea is *far* from perfect, but the written laws at least outline many types of cases where there would be an abuse of power.
* **Parents of the Victim:** I completely understand that everyone's situation with their family is not the same. Some people have family that is broke, abuses and hates them. Others do not have these issues. It still blows my mind that in cases where a young woman is raped, after being in a potentially dangerous situation that people don't look at the parents of both the victim(s) and the rapist(s). In the IAmA, the victim stated that she was on 1000s of miles away from home in another state and did not have money to go home. She was offered to either leave and find her own way home or to do the shoot and have her costs covered. Like many 18 year olds, she was broke, so she made the choice to go with the shoot (not fully knowing all the details of it). I saw that from where she was in San Diego to Washington was a less than $100 on Frontier airlines. California can be rough, but suffice to say there is a plethora of very cheap hotels/motels options. Taxis and Uber also exist. If the victim is saying she was so young, very broke and far away from home with no way back, what kind of parents does she have? In the event I knew my daughter was travelling across the country for a ""modelling"" gig, I'd understand as a parent that someone may try and take advantage of her. I'd come with her or have my wife go with her. If at 18 my daughter was impressionable enough to think that travelling across the country alone, with no money to get back and not telling us is okay, I'd feel like I failed as a parent. I'd be horrified if my *son* did this. I can't imagine raising my daughter to be naive enough for this to be a thing. So yes, people lie, but why don't more parents teach their daughters about the realities of being a woman? I've read countless stories from young women who had either unrealistic expectations or had placed themselves into a dangerous situation, whom were later on sexually harassed or worse. I can't blame an 18 year old for making a poor choice, but the adults in her life look *weak*. Teachers too. Teach young women to protect their safety and be extra cautious. My daughter putting herself at risk because she didn't have access to $200 of her own or my money is a major failure as a parent. At 18 get the poor woman a CapitalOne card or an Amex with a low limit. She might have been afraid to tell me that she fucked up, in which case I *still* failed as a parent. This is how I feel when a girl get's piss drunk on her own and something terrible happens. Her parents did a bad job a preparing her for life as a young woman. 
* **Parents of the rapist**: Raising a child who grows up to do something horrible does not automatically make you a bad parent. Raising a child who does not understand when to say ""it's okay, you're not comfortable enough for this"" or ""you're way too drunk. Let me get you home safe"" is a major issue. Parents clearly aren't talking to their kids about what it means to have consent or not. A lot of people make consent really complex and yes, from a legal standpoint our stupid system has made this work. In practice though, consent really is not complicated most of the time. There's no reason a sober person or even a person who is a little tipsy, should be trying to have sex with someone who is blackout drunk. The most basic examples of when you should not even attempt to have sex with a person are not being taught and this is a major problem.

Why do we not do more as a society to stop rape for even happening? Exposing and prosecuting people *after they've already raped someone* is not good enough.",changemyview

I feel like people saying this either have a very skewed view of what constitutes far left (they're far left does not match anybody else's reasonable definition) or are just lying.

To clarify a few things on my view:

1.  I am not talking about people who were very moderate or slightly conservative and specifically disliked Trump then decided he isn't all that bad.  I find that scenario believable.
2. My definition of far left is not just I'm OK with more taxes and a healthcare plan similar to the ACA.  Too me the most lax definition of far left is someone who is serious about wealth redistribution, strongly supports a single payer healthcare system, is for green energy and feels strongly about climate change, etc..

I'm open to having my view changed on either points one or two.  For instance either that you in fact held at least the views mentioned in point 2 and switched sides or that those views are not representative of a far left view in US politics.  that being said I feel like I've been pretty lax in my definition of far left and a lot of other countries would consider them moderate views and I would really like to see something well researched if you're going to call Biden far left for example.  Also if somebody comes in and says they fit point one I will try to assume they are arguing in good faith but I would really like a pretty detailed account of your past views and why you would call yourself far left then and what changed or if you literally have a four year old account where you stated your views four years ago and can point to a comment(s) then obviously you've changed my mind. Simply stating you were far left and now you aren't because you're older and wiser or whatever isn't going to change my mind.

I would be happy to have my view changed here. I don't want to dismiss people with legitimate views as shills and I don't like feeling like I'm gatekeeping what constitutes far left unfairly.  I'd also really like to hear what convinced those people in detail either way.",changemyview

You shouldn't care about the race of the person selling the product, it should all be based around the quality and price.

Just 100 years ago we were fighting merely with guns. Now we already have nukes that have the ability to wipe out cities and they have even been used - decades ago. If we don't already have the capability to make nukes that can wipe out large countries or even continents then I reckon within the next 100 years we will do. 

Our ability as humans to keep innovating will most definitely lead to very very powerful weapons being created. There is such a want/need for power and control by the larger nations that it is almost inevitable that these nukes will be made. Even if not made for the purpose of them actually being used, but to have as a counter for other nations who wish to make them (and intending to use them).

Then all it takes is the wrong person or the wrong event to cause one of these to be used. In my mind it's inevitable that it'll happen. Many very evil historical figures have wanted world domination and/or have committed atrocities on a very large scale. If any of these figures had access to these kinds of nukes (that could take out continents, etc) then they would most likely have used them. If one person/nation has the power to say ""give me X, Y, Z or I'll kill us all"" then inevetiably I think it'll happen.

We have morals because we expect others to follow them aswell to ensure YOUR life is happy. We don't steal so that others do not steal from us and end up ruining our days as a result. We are kind to our parents (given they are good) because we'll feel guilty and bad about it later on if we aren't most of the time.

We create useful inventions that change the world because everybody else was too lazy to make it. Why did we make the invention? To make OUR lives easier.

People who are considered ""selfless"" and do acts that only ""hurt"" them and help others are only doing selfless acts because either:

A. They want to be recognized for it.

B. They are expecting others to treat them like they treat others in return

C. They think being selfless will make THEM happy in the end.

Everything we do is for ourselves. Often, the things we do also benefit others, but why do we benefit others? To make ourselves feel good because we just did a morally good thing.

(I'm not religious but for those who ARE) Jesus hung himself on the cross for our sins because he loves us, but he only did it in the first place because he doesn't want to see his hard work burn in hell and be condemned for eternity.

Maybe 99% of their net worth is tied up in assets, and only 1% of it is cash.

Poor people have only a few assets. Maybe something like 10% to 20% of their net worth is in cash - money in their checking accounts, savings accounts, under their mattress, etc.

Inflation drives asset prices up and the value of cash down.

By now, you can see where I am going with this. When the government increases the money supply (I'm looking at you, Federal Reserve) and causes inflation, you can see how this disproportionately affects the total wealth of rich people and poor people.

Say the government inflated money such that a dollar bill lost half it's value over a period of 30 years. The poor person would see a real decline of 50% of 20% of their net worth - or **10%** overall.

The rich person would see a decline of 50% of 1% of their net worth - or only *0.5%* overall.

The government is constantly inflating the money, officially targeting 2% a year but historically going well beyond that. We have yet to see what will unfold in the future. But we know that the government officially endorses exponentially decreasing the value of money.

There are two big ways you could change my view:

* Correct my estimations with hard data. I assume rich people have more of their net worth in assets than poor people but maybe I'm completely wrong. I'm not an expert and I don't even know how I would look for this data. I gave my best estimates for the sake of articulating my position.

In a hypothetical world where the ability existed to remove a fetus and place it in an incubator at any point in a pregnancy AND the procedure to do so had exactly the same side effects as abortion at that stage in pregnancy, then it would be morally wrong to abort a pregnancy. I also think it should be illegal, given that hypothetical option existed and was an option. 

That being said, this is obviously not possible, so I think abortions should be legal and the choice of the pregnant woman because not being able to remove a fetus takes away from the bodily autonomy of the pregnant woman.

Instead of realizing that these perks are given to them in return for doing what's right by the people, they just sit up there and do whatever their party says or whatever puts more money in their pockets.

Pay them only what the median salary is in their respective state.

Healthcare, 100% out of pocket, unless they make healthcare free for all. Their family members, the same exact thing. No free ride, no add your family member to the plan. Pay out of pocket for every single person you want to be insured, and pay 100% of it. Their salaries come from the public, so as long as we have to pay for our healthcare plans, they should too. Once they get their shit together, stand up to the insurance companies, and make healthcare a right to all, they can get their free healthcare back.

But there is NO reason why we as the taxpayers should be paying for them to get free healthcare, while we don't get afforded the same luxury.

When they're not working, they're not getting paid. 10th recess of the year, cool. You don't get paid for that time. When you're in the office, working, you get paid. When you're not, you don't get paid.

They clearly are so disconnected from what the average person needs in America, so give them the same exact benefits/pay. Let them work for just enough money to survive while getting half-assed benefits. I'm sure it will motivate them much more to get shit done for the people instead of for themselves.

Let me preface this by saying I used to strongly believe that Trump is racist and I considered my political alignment to be far left. The 2016 election absolutely shocked me because I didn't believe a racist could ever generate a large enough base to get elected. But in response, I decided to spend time reading conservative viewpoints so I could understand how someone could possibly vote for Trump.

Slowly I started to see how I and many people on the left were consistently taking the least charitable interpretation of Trump's every sentence. Many of the things he said seemed racist only because I already thought he was racist; I unconsciously interpreted his words in a way that didn't conflict with my ideology. But when I decided to take the literal interpretation of the words he said, with no attempts at mind-reading or assumptions of dog-whistling, my belief that he was a racist became much shakier. And if went further and considered a charitable interpretation, it seemed even less likely that he was racist.

I now consider myself to be center-left, because I'm still liberal on most issues and I still strongly oppose Trump for various reasons. But I now understand the different ways his words can be interpreted and I'm no longer so sure he's a racist. Now, I see that many people think it's beyond question that he's a racist, and to even question that belief is ludicrous. I wonder, are they in the same mental state that I used to be in, servants of their own ideology? Or do they know/understand something that I'm missing?

To that end I'm asking you all, what are the best arguments that Trump is racist? If I'm missing something, please help me see it.

Final thing. When I talked about how accusations of Trump's racism seem predicated on uncharitable interpretations, I didn't give any concrete examples. This article has some good ones.

However, there are certain times that I would really enjoy having the option of an audiobook, but paying full price for the physical copy AND the audiobook is silly. I believe most people are in this same boat and can’t justify buying a book twice. 

I have to assume that the the near entirety of the publisher’s investment into getting a book into audiobook format comes from the recording and editing of the audiobook. Once the audiobook is ready to go, there aren’t many additional costs. 

I bought your book to read. I’ll happily pay you a few more dollars *at the time of purchase* to be able to listen to it as well. 

I don’t like thinking that I know more that publishing companies that are *literally* the experts. Please, tell me why I’m silly to think this would be a win-win for everyone.

**EDIT:** It appears as if there are varying structures related to audiobook profit sharing. Under the royalty structure—where some combination of publisher/author/narrator are all paid a % of each sale—I believe it not to be advantageous to offer the audiobook at a heavy discount. However, there are certain publisher’s that don’t utilize this structure, and I still believe it would be in their best interest to offer a discount.

**EDIT 2:** *“How are you going to stop people from getting the audio/physical book for the cheaper price and onselling it?”*

That’s not the intention. As I said in the original post, I’m contemplating if this would be a pricing structure that is a “win-win” for both the consumer and those involved in the publishing of the physical book and the audiobook.

and he also has a quote of his own that eloquently sums up my view:

""We have forgotten this distinction between an intellectual democracy and a democracy by birthright. We have given the vote to all without connecting it to wisdom.""

I picked these examples because de Botton goes into more depth than I am willing to type out here (for those interested).

My main reason for this post is because I simply do not see how democracy can function if just anyone, regardless of how much they know or even care about the pertinent issues, gets to influence society's trajectory. I understand that no system is perfect and there is a quite glaring problem with elitism that can and probably will arise if voting is not considered a birthright. However, looking at the state of affairs in many countries around the world right now, and also throughout history, I can't help but think the alternative is worse. The alternative being an easily stoked mob mentality that is leveraged by a populist autocrat (or party) to swing votes in their favor without adequate scrutiny.

I'm not proposing anything drastic (at least in my mind); simply improved education. Education targeted towards some of the basics of a country's social and economic workings as well as how it fits into the global stage. I (and hopefully others) would be much more accepting of a democratic vote if I am confident people know what they are actually voting for. Elitism isn't even just an issue with my train of thought; I think the current system leads to massive divides in a population which can be easily leveraged by those already with power and influence.

Note: I tried not to make this into a left vs right thing and would appreciate responses that don't steer too much in this direction.

Edit: I haven't responded to everything just yet as I have real world commitments that need addressing.  But thank you all for the great points and civil discussions.

Edit 2: It has been brought to my intention that perhaps the main intention of my post has not been elucidated as well as I hoped. I am not arguing about the purposes of democracy, but rather about ways to improve upon its current implementation.",changemyview
CMV: Making fun of Liberals or gun control advocates for not knowing that the AR in AR-15 stands for ArmaLite Rifle is just stupid.,121,j60b75,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j60b75/cmv_making_fun_of_liberals_or_gun_control/,309,2020-10-06 14:40:25," 

Some background: I am a conservative who believes in \*slightly\* stricter gun control in America. I have a background in military history studies so of course I know what AR-15 means (if for no other reason than for ""the troubles"").

Every goddam time I want to have a healthy discussion about gun control the first question I get asked is ""what does the AR in AR-15 stand for"", and I just don't see why it matters. I really don't. So what? Liberals could ask about 45 questions that are simple for them about climate change that no many Republicans couldn't answer, but that doesn't negate their opponents' arguments. Just like gun control advocates not knowing what AR-15 stands for does not invalidate their ideas. Especially if their ideas have nothing at all to do with the AR-15!",changemyview

In my opinion, the only way in which you could consider it a “debate” is that it features two participants who were against each other regarding their politics, or fighting to win over the viewers to their party. Other than that, it really can’t be considered a debate. It was extremely informal, there were not many solid arguments being given, they only had two minutes to speak, the moderator was incredibly active (which isn’t bad, it’s just not *usual*), there wasn’t a clearly structured cross-examination of the opponents, and there weren’t any questions taken from the audience (again, not bad considering the circumstances, just not usual). 
This wasn’t the only problem with the debate, however. The main problem is that it was not intellectually stimulating. It was banter. Unorganized, talking-point-oriented banter. 
*What needs to happen*
The citizens of this country deserve a real, intellectual debate. Here is a rough idea:
Side 1: 10 minutes of uninterrupted introduction (the contestant must lay out their arguments)
Side 2: 10 minutes of uninterrupted introduction (same as above)
Side 1: 5 minutes of response time
Side 2: 5 minutes of response time
1: 2 minutes
2: 2 minutes
1: Question for 2, 2 gets 2 minutes to answer
2: Question for 1, 1 gets 2 minutes to answer
Maybe repeat questioning?
Audience questions (this would look more like the presidential debates we have seen). 
Don’t grill me on my knowledge of debate construction, I know it’s not perfect. My main point is that, in order to really be able to decide who is educated, and who will perform better as president, we need an intellectual debate, not banter.

We all feel deeply, but some of us have better coping mechanisms than others.",46,j5wfyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j5wfyi/cmv_the_highly_sensitive_person_trait_is_not_a/,63,2020-10-06 09:43:53,"Here is an infographic that explains the concept I'm skeptical about: https://m.imgur.com/gallery/gfkIT7q

CMV: I believe the idea of a ""highly sensitive person"" is flawed. I'm open to being showed some science to back up this 1 in 5 claim. Please don't confuse this idea with sensory processing disorder or being on the spectrum. I believe both of those are official diagnoses and they deserve their own category.

It's not that I don't believe we have different levels of sensitivity. I just reject the idea that 1 in 5 people have a special connection to their emotions and feelings and the rest of us schlubs just don't get it. I married into a family of self-diagnosed ""highly sensitive people"" and it drives me nuts when I'm told that I just wouldn't understand what it's like to feel so deeply. I think we all process information in different ways and we have our own individual response to them. And here's where maybe I'm a little insensitive...I think some people have poorly developed coping mechanisms.

In high school I had lots of social anxiety. I over thought and ruminated on everything. It was crippling. I didn't sleep well because I needed to go over every conversation in my head 20 times over. I worried what others were thinking of me. Yes, this is common among HS students (so you're starting to agree with me). Over time I realized that my over-sensitivity was hindering me. So, I practiced turning off those intrusive thoughts. I would intentionally force myself to move on and think of something else if a thought was particularly upsetting to me. For example, my mom is dying of brain cancer. I'm not immune to sad thoughts, but I've developed strategies for coping.

So, this is my experience and this is my perspective. When 1 in 5 people claim to be in a special category for which the other 4 in 5 ""just couldn't understand"" I wonder if these people have just not worked hard enough on their coping mechanisms.",changemyview
"CMV: The left (particularly on reddit) should be universal in unequivocal condemnation of tankies and should reject them from all leftist spaces and movements, with no exceptions.",38,j5vv3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j5vv3w/cmv_the_left_particularly_on_reddit_should_be/,103,2020-10-06 09:05:37,"I've been on a pretty plodding journey to the left over the course of the last year or so, and one of my biggest hangups has been the left's acceptance of tankies. 

For those that don't know, a tankie is an authoritarian leftist, often a Stalinist or Maoist, who sees the most abominable acts of the most abominable leftist regimes not as mistakes or failings or ""not real X,"" but rather as the proper way to build the best possible society. For example your average leftist trying to be an apologist for the USSR might point to certain things that regime did right while condemning the oppression and bigotry and ethnic cleansings and mass killings and genocides and ideological imprisonment and torture and all the rest of it; a tankie, if they acknowledge these things happened at all (many tankies are the left wing equivalent of Holocaust deniers when it comes to leftist atrocities), will often celebrate these things and view them as the proper way to practice leftism. They don't look at Stalin and find things to admire despite him being a tyrannical despot - they love him *because* he is a tyrannical despot. They see the fact that the USSR has committed more of the largest genocides in human history than any other power in world history to be a good thing (again, assuming they acknowledge it at all and don't try to conspiracy theory their way out of it). Or while your average leftist might support an abolition of for profit, capitalist landlords, a tankie would think landlords ought to be rounded up and shot without trial a la Mao. 

In short, at least to my eyes, tankies seem almost unreservedly evil. I view them very much to the left what Neo Nazis are to the right - obviously on the same side but a crazy, malignant fringe that at least *ought* to be rejected by the mainstream. 

Cue my surprise, then, at the level of acceptance they  seem to have at least among the reddit leftist community. [Using subredditstats](https://subredditstats.com/subreddit-user-overlaps/shitliberalssay) you can see that very mainstream leftist subreddits like r/socialism, r/breadtube, r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM, r/COMPLETEANARCHY, r/fragilewhiteredditor, r/therightcantmeme, r/anarchism, r/vaushv, r/socialistra, r/latestagecapitalism, r/lostgeneration, and r/toiletpaperusa all have *massive* user overlap with openly tankie subs like r/ShitLiberalsSay and r/GenZedong (as they did with the late r/MoreTankieChapo). Subs like r/DankLeft even have rules, ostensibly in the interest of promoting left unity, that make critiquing tankies a bannable offense. 

While I might forgive open shitpost subs where the whole point is to allow *anyone* to post (e.g. r/PoliticalCompassMemes) for allowing tankies to find a home there, many of the subs I just listed are incredibly popular leftist subreddits that proport to be a good place for leftist news, ideology, theory, and discussion. I dont know about you but if I was moderating or very active on a sub and I found out that people who used an openly nazi sub were up to 70x more likely than the average redditor to frequent my sub *I would freak out.* But to the contrary I see very few leftists who seem to give a shit that they're rubbing digital shoulders with tankies every day on reddit. Ive met a handful of anarchists who openly profess their hatred for tankies, but thats about it. I've even had many otherwise very reasonable and intelligent leftists calmly explain to me that they *need* tankies in their ranks to achieve their goals, which again strikes me like an otherwise mild conservative telling me they *need* Neo Nazis to be a part of their community. 

There's been a lot of hurdles towards my becoming a leftist and the biggest, most off putting concern now that I am is the notion that amiable participation on any leftist sub (and one might wonder to what extent this applies to irl leftist communities) means being buddy buddy with tankies. Even if theyre not spouting tankie rhetoric to me at that very moment I would feel tarnished and dirty just by association. And I can't fathom why this isn't a near universal belief among other leftists. Many of those subs are very quick indeed to ban people for saying non-leftist stuff or even just for having participated on non-leftist subs, so clearly all those subs i listed have the *capability* to drive out the tankies *if they wanted.* But they don't. *Why?* I don't understand it, and frankly it seems kind of nefarious to me and makes me wonder if the progressive ""we just want a better world"" rhetoric among common leftists isn't just a thin veneer hiding much more sinister intentions.",changemyview
"CMV: There is far too much emotion in politics, more so on the left.",0,j5uic8,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j5uic8/cmv_there_is_far_too_much_emotion_in_politics/,77,2020-10-06 07:38:09,"I’ll preface this by saying that I am progressive on most issues, the exceptions being gun control and taxation. Emotional politics, primarily from the left, are making me feel like a conservative when I am nowhere near that. I understand that emotion plays a part in politics, because policy affects things in our lives. However, some policy stances completely ignore logic in favor of emotion. I’ll give some examples:

The left is super emotional regarding gun control, particularly when it comes to AR-15s and “high capacity magazines”. Most gun deaths are suicides, and gun murders are primarily committed with handguns. The FBI’s 2016 Uniform Crime Report says that out of 11,004 firearm murders, 374 were committed using rifles of any type; that’s 3.39% of all firearm murders. The left generally ignores this logic, and focuses on “look at these people that lost their lives in mass shootings where an AR was used” and “why do you need something like that to protect yourself”. It’s sensationalism at its worst. I get that people are scared because of what they see on the news or what they have personally experienced, but the facts also have to be considered.

There is also too much emotion surrounding police violence. Whenever something happens, people are too quick to make emotional judgements. Take, for example, the Sean Reed killing: he was live-streaming himself running from the police. When he got out of the car, there was no clear video of the shooting. There were, however, two distinct gunshots followed by several distinctly different gunshots. Everyone freaked out because he had been shot in the back. As it turns out, the weapon recovered from him (which he took pictures with and posted on social media) was determined by investigators to be fired twice, consistent with the audio on his livestream. It is possible to fire a gun behind you while running away. Another thing I have issue with is the quick jump to racism. For most of these police shootings of black people, there is no evidence of racism. Even shootings where the police officer is a person of color have been labeled as racially motivated. Most of the time, it is completely unfounded. I’m not saying that police violence is not a problem, but I am saying that the root cause is not racism. I think the root cause is lack of training made worse by subconscious bias. It makes sense that a person that has not been properly or consistently trained is more likely to revert to deadly force when facing threats. More training could mean that police have more confidence in tactics that do not involve discharging their weapons when dealing with unarmed threats. Bias training could result in fewer instances of targeted enforcement, regardless of the race of the officer and where their bias exists.

There are other examples such as mask wearing, LGBTQ+ issues, race issues, womens issues, etc. where I agree with the progressive ideology. But I don’t publicly express my views due to the typical liberal response to people that oppose those things. If you take issue with any liberal position you are automatically labeled racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, non-caring etc. There is very little discourse to be done after you call someone names like that, because people get defensive. How can you expect to have a meaningful conversation, come to an understanding, or even convince someone of your position after you just called them a racist cuckservative? Also, you probably don’t know the person well enough to make a judgement call on whether or not they are actually racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. It’s all an emotional reaction.

I guess I’m more critical of the left because that is where I lie on the issues and I want them to be better. It’s just very irritating to me, as a liberal, that other liberals can be so empathetic when it comes to social issues that may or may not affect them personally, but so intolerant of people that have different opinions. People are unique, and you should try to empathize with everyone. I don’t have to agree with a Trump supporter to empathize with them and really try to understand why they think what they think.",changemyview

This means cases where people speak different languages, cases where the recipient didn’t hear/read/understand what was said to them, or anything else I mention in the explanation. This has been my stance THE WHOLE TIME and these arguments are therefore not contributing to the conversation/changing anyone’s views. That is why this post has an explanation and not just a title.

Tl;dr: If you respond to the title without reading the post, I will ignore you.

EDIT: the **vast** majority of replies I’ve gotten directly go against one of the cases I specifically include in my explanation/one of the defining features of a misunderstanding that I list. If you disagree with these (which is completely valid), *please* refute them directly instead of supplying a counter-example that ignores them.

Communication is a two way street; it is an interaction between the explainer and the recipient. If the two are trying to transfer information from one to the other, they each have a distinct responsibility. The explainer has a responsibility to be clear, which I think is reasonable enough (although feel free to offer a rebuttal to this point). I think it is less clear what the responsibility of the recipient is.

In my opinion, the sole responsibility of a recipient is to wholly receive the explainers content. That means, for instance, reading all of a reply before replying in turn. I constantly see, however, counter-replies that say “*you misunderstood me/my point*.” I think this places an unfair onus on the recipient to work through the explainer’s statement.

I think that if a response refers only to what is written by the OP (that is, the responder doesn’t make anything up, misquote the OP, etc.), it is never acceptable for the OP in turn to say “you misunderstood.” Even if the recipient completely misses the intended point, is offended/angry and responds aggressively, or any other non-productive result occurs where communication is not successful. It is up to the explainer to include caveats and side notes and whatever else makes their view clear enough that it represents the information they want to convey. In essence, they are responsible for any way their statements *could* be received, regardless of their intentions.

I **do** think that there are cases where a failure to communicate is the fault of the recipient. I just also think that in none of these cases does “you misunderstood” apply, but rather something like “you didn’t read my response all the way through” or “you’re responding based on faulty assumptions which can’t be logically derived from what I said” or “you only speak Cantonese and you are on an English speaking subreddit.”

If you don’t think this view is contentious enough to be here, just look around the subreddit. Heck, just look around reddit in general. “You misunderstood me” is all over the place and I think every instance of it should say something else.

CMV

Common issues that have come up:
-I am only referring to the use of the term “misunderstand” here, not a lack of understanding in general. Examples regarding a lack of understanding of math or other definably correct/incorrect things therefore don’t quite apply. Only if I misunderstood a mathematical concept, like if I thought exponentiation was not distinct from addition, would my argument apply.

-Counterarguments in the form of “what if 99 people understand something and 1 person doesn’t” are just saying “what if it is the recipients fault that they don’t understand.” I cover these cases explicitly in my explanation, so unless you talk about *why*, these arguments are not contributing anything meaningful to the conversation.

-Jokes, sarcasm, etc. are not efforts to communicate clearly, which is like the first requirement I mention to define what types of cases I’m talking about.",changemyview

**TLDR at bottom (it's the title)**

*For context - I live in Atlantic Canada.*

I used to love driving, couldn't afford a car when I moved out, exclusively bicycled instead for the last several years, recently got a good job, so got a carshare, and have been very surprised by how shitty driving is now that I'm an adult.

I got my license at 16 and in retrospect I am horrified that anyone let me behind the wheel at that age. The written test was a one-page piece of cake, the driving test was brief and didn't cover anything difficult (like parallel parking, merging on the highway, finding the turning lane, etc) - it boiled down to seeing if I knew what a flashing green was, and whether I remembered to check my mirrors. It's been a decade and I have not yet been required to take another driving or written test - even if several of the local laws regarding driving have been altered. Driver training isn't even mandatory - if you pay $600, you can take your (easy) tests and walk out with a license to drive after doing it exactly one time.

My city has had a string of ped/car and bike/car collisions over the last few years (and so, I'm seeing, have many other places). So many people have died or been seriously hurt, and it's being treated as a fact of life. Comments in the articles blame the victim, as if the driver was inconvenienced in any way besides having to fix a dent. I don't know the exact circumstances of these collisions, but two humans colliding at 5km/h or even two bikes colliding at 20km/h is obviously a lot less serious than anything colliding with a car. I don't think enough drivers are aware of the incredible responsibility you have when piloting a very heavy, very fast machine, and aren't aware enough of the risks of not taking it seriously. I'm seeing a lot of fatalities for ""pedestrians wearing dark clothes walking at night"" and this is often framed as their fault - when in reality, doesn't it make more sense for the person driving the vehicle to drive slowly enough to be able to stop in time in low-light conditions like nightime? If they're in the city, shouldn't they slow at every intersection, assuming an unseen person is there? Why is the onus on the pedestrian to own and remember to bring a safety vest or white tshirt each time they have to get somewhere after dark? **As car drivers, we get the benefit of fast, convenient travel - at the price of the responsibility of not hurting anyone.** I know in many situations the ped/bike was clearly at fault. This post is about the rest of the collisions.

Some ideas:

* Reduced speed limits in cities (from 50km/h to more like 30) so people have more time to see and react to situations unfolding ahead and around them. With stop signs and lights, I can't imagine metro driving times would get significantly higher.
* Heavier, more frequent fines for texting/speeding/tailgating/blasting through an active crosswalk/unsafe passing...
* Much longer and more in-depth written tests, focusing more on actual behavior than regulations like how bright your taillights should be in lumens. For example, that EVERY intersection, even if unmarked, is a crosswalk. Or that if you can't pass a bike or ped safely with at least one metre of clearance, you CANNOT legally pass. No 'sneaking by'!
* Mandatory re-taking of written test every six months, with policy updated, to keep it fresh. Allow doing this online. Make it open book. The point is to reinforce these standards.
* Much more involved and frequent mandatory driving tests. I'm talking several hours for a couple of days every year or so, in multiple road conditions (wet/dry/fog/night), in multiple situations (major highway, rural highway, rush hour in a city, turning left against traffic, safely exiting a blind drive...) and demonstrating knowledge of as many of the items in the written test as possible.

&#x200B;

I get that increased person-hours in testing etc would be expensive - perhaps steeper ticketing by automated systems for the stuff above...?

And of course I know that no one's perfect, including myself, and that this is not about perfect adherence, and more about a cultural shift and onus. I think most irresponsible drivers would become better drivers if they actually HAD to. I'm not hoping for anyone to lose their license unless they've demonstrated that they are unable or unwilling to drive safely.

I also know I don't have any real, tested proposals (this is just my experience/opinion, I'm no policymaker) and that this is getting into fantasy territory. My view stands. When thinking out this post, I realized I can't even imagine a city that isn't smoggy, noisy, and full of traffic and cars and road rage and collisions, and that scared me.

I'm not sure how this got so long, been building up for a while I guess. I cut so much of this out (I've been editing for two hours) and I'm excited to talk about it.**TLDR: My view: access to cars has become ubiquitous, and because of that, and safe driving not being a priority/enforced, many people don't take the responsibility seriously, leading to entitlement, dangerous driving, and people getting hurt.**",changemyview

For background I lean Kantian for ethics and my view on metaphysics follows from David Lewis.

>Are you then suggesting that ""I wish I had a new pair of sneakers"" is equivalent to ""I wish some kid in the third world would be forced to work in a factory""? 

I mean, based on the current state of the world, functionally yes. I realize people don’t recognize it that way, but if one really understood how chains of commerce worked you would see one as a logical correlate of the other.

Like let’s say you wished for a tanzanite ring. Now tanzanite only exists in one very small part of Tanzania. And the mining practices that they engage in are not the most ethical as I believe a majority (if not all) of the mining is done by children. So for you to wish for a tanzanite ring is to basically desire a world to remain as it is, but with one specific change. And the idea is that if you truly understood the social costs of a tanzanite ring you would not wish for it.

>Or, to take a different approach, if you say ""I wish I had a lollipop"" and you get the lollipop because 15 people died a horrible death, somehow resulting in you getting the lollipop, were you then wishing for their deaths?

No this would be different. Because that’s not keeping the world the same as it is but for one specific change. It’s a logical correlate for my to wish that I had a lollipop to logically correlate with the wish for the continued existence of sugar production and candy makers as without those I could not have one. But there is no logical correlate with the fire as it has no causal necessity to the continued existence of lollipops.

>Is ""I wish I could get a heart transplant"" equivalent in your mind to ""I wish I could get a heart transplant, no matter the cost to others""?  Or does wishing assume some vague boundary conditions that aren't specified because no one feels the need to spell out every possible way in which the wish might be fulfilled and which are acceptable?  In fact, isn't this precisely the basis on which ""Wishes Gone Wrong"" stories work?

I mean to an extent yeah. But because the fundamental cost to others, in order for you to have a heart transplant, is their life. Like wishing for a kidney or marrow transplant is not because you receiving those does not necessitate another’s death. That is not to say you couldn’t still receive it that way, but that if you did it was not a logical correlate thereof and thus you did not wish for it. The world could have changed such that everything remained the same but for you receiving a kidney transplant and that would not have necessitated someone dying in order for that change to be achieved.

>Wishing for an outcome is not the same as wishing for the means by which that end is accomplished.

Obviously I fundamentally disagree with that notion.

>Are you, as a Kantian, committed to refusing organ transplants?  Or just to refusing to hope or wish for one until after the donor is already dead?

No I’m saying you should not wish for one at all. That to some degree if you realized what you were wishing for you would stop wishing for that thing because there is no way for what you’re wishing for to occur except with horrific social impacts. But why would I refuse them? Doing so benefits no one? I would not necessarily rejoice though, or at least not fully, if I found out one became available because of the social cost required for that to occur.

>For that matter, wishing (in the absence of magic) is simply the expression of a desire - it's hard to see how expressing a desire is necessarily a moral act at all. 

I agree that it’s the expression of a desire, in this case an immoral one. But I’ll give you an example for why I think expressing it is immoral. The statement “I wish I could have sex with a minor” is an immoral desire, one which we would condemn. Or would you not feel that statement to be morally repugnant and indicative of a immoral person?

>There's a big difference between ""some will work and some won't"" and ""you are wishing for one, specific person to die"" and you keep trying to treat them equivalently.

I’m hoping if you’ve read this far you’ll understand why I view those as equivalent

Edit in order to clarify my views (looking back I realize this was a much longer conversation): 
My underlying premise is that it is immoral to view people as a means to an end, and that people should be viewed always as an end in and of themselves. My belief as to why this applies here is that the wish for someone else to die for the sake of my happiness treats that person as a means to an end. 

My belief as to why this matters even if no actions are taken is due to Lewis’s belief in possible worlds as a real irreducible existence (modal realism). 

A wish, to my understanding, is a desire for the world (as it is unless stated otherwise) to change in one discrete way that you would find positive and that still must own all the logical consequents of that wish. Thus wishing for a heart has as a requirement that someone die, whereas wishing for a kidney does not. As an important clarification, a wish is not a passing desire or other fleeting thought. A wish is a deeply held desire that one, if the opportunity arose, would be actually inclined to act on. 

I hope this clarifies somewhat, but please let me know in the comments if this still is either unclear or not sufficiently detailed.",changemyview
CMV: American doctors owe it to the people to have supervised injection sites,0,j5nsy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j5nsy7/cmv_american_doctors_owe_it_to_the_people_to_have/,47,2020-10-06 01:31:38,"I’ll start off with some basic information. For anyone who doesn’t know, supervised injection sites or safe injection sites or something similar is a name for places that help drug addicts. These places have doctors and needles on hand and can determine if your drug has anything else in it. They are designed to stop life-threatening infections due to dirty needles, save people from overdose, limit consumption of drugs that are laced with something else, and create a safe and non-judgmental place for addicts to find help. These places often have resources to send people to that can help them recover. I probably missed some stuff but that is the gist of it.

Now to the opinion part

The opiate crisis has been ravaging through the US for quite some time now. While I don’t blame doctors as a whole, I do believe some are responsible for spreading this. Opiates were overprescribed for a long time which has lead so many people into a life long addiction. Something as simple as a minor surgery can change someone’s life. Most of us can agree that in this sense opiates are dangerous. 

Doctors put so many Americans in a situation where their life started to revolve around drugs. They started on prescription drugs and end up using hardcore drugs. The doctors put them in this situation but now refuse to get them out of it. These people are criminalized and many of them loose their lives to drugs.

Safe injection sites would save a lot of lives and help so many people recover. America owes it to these people to help them bc they got them addicted. 

I’m interested in hearing arguments against this as I feel pretty strongly in this and want to hear all sides of this debate

Edit: what I’m arguing here is not that individual doctors are wrong, I’m saying that the US should allow safe injection sites. I also believe the doctors should be pushing for these sites.",changemyview
"CMV: Even if there is no God, everyone would be better off believing in one.",0,j5o38i,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j5o38i/cmv_even_if_there_is_no_god_everyone_would_be/,29,2020-10-06 01:46:10,"Maybe not necessarily believing that there is a God, but at least having some kind of faith or religion.

I'm not debating here whether there is or isn't a God or about the nature of existence - my point is that knowing the truth about existence is not worth the hassle, that is, if we suppose that in fact there is no God and life has ultimately no meaning, we mostly just gain existential dread and a feeling of emptiness from this knowledge, even if it's true. So, should we even try to get to know the truth? I think not.

Research has shown that religious people have better mental health, which to me isn't a surprise. I used to believe in God and my life was a whole lot easier then. But thanks to my philosophy classes I became agnostic, and I can safely say this was a negative change in my life. My mental health, though it wasn't too great, became a lot worse, and to this day I struggle with existential dread sometimes. We all do, I believe. But we don't have to.

In reality I believe there are two problems with religion: First is fanaticism, radical beliefs that blind people and make them act in completely irrational ways. Second is the exploitation of religion by people who only want power and riches, and so manipulate others (usually into being blind fanatics). However neither of these are intrinsic or necessary to religion, in fact it often contradicts these religions' basic principles. For example, churches tend to be very rich and powerful institutions, and often breed hate and bigotry - all of which is the exact opposite of what Jesus preached. The same goes for many other religions. Hence why the problem with religion isn't religion itself, but rather its exploitation by greedy, power-hungry people.

If it wasn't for that, religion would be the greatest thing ever. It would give people a sense of purpose, an explanation to why we're here and almost a guide on how to live. Clearly this would lead to enormous mental health benefits.

To quote Nietzsche, ""To live is to suffer. To survive is to find meaning in the suffering."" Obviously finding a meaning in suffering is a very difficult task. And yeah, there are people who can do it, but many, if not most, can't. But the whole point of religion, at least in theory, is to offer a meaning. 

Does this mean everyone should go to church on Sunday and repent for their sins? Not necessarily. Maybe a better option would be for everyone to form their own belief framework, based upon one or multiple religious teachings. You shouldn't have to take everything in the Bible as gospel, for example even when I was a Christian I used to think the Old Testament is a load of BS. I still believe Christians should focus on what Christ said, not some ancient mythology from the time when Gods were seen as assholes. Of course this is my understanding.

I also think we shouldn't teach Nihilist/Atheist philosophy in schools, only in academia, and philosophers like Nietzsche and Schopenhauer should be read and known only by those strong enough to be able to deal with it.

What do you think?


Edit: Alright everyone, you have changed my mind. Many people are better off not being religious. Religion is not the solution to all of life's problems.

In his game, people refer to your character by its color as there are no character names. A lot of people refer to “dark green” as green and “lime” as light green. Here are the reasons why this can be confusing.

1. Lime can come in many shades of green. Lime is first dark green and then it becomes light green when it is ripe. Calling a color “lime” to differentiate it from another shade of green is vague since lime comes in all shades of green. 

2. A lot of people call “light green” lime and “dark green” green. When someone says green, most people don’t think of dark green, but just something in between dark green and light green. 

3. Calling green “dark green” will cause a lot of confusion itself, since there are 2 shades of green in the game. It’s just as arbitrary as calling light green “green” and calling dark green “avocado”. When you say “green” people would need clarification on which green you are referring to, so referring to dark green as green just won’t cut it. 

4. Lime is a fruit, not much a color. I don’t see anyone referring to light green as lime outside of among us. People just call light green light green. You might counterpoint this by saying “well orange is a fruit but we still call it the color orange”. In orange’s case, the color was named after the fruit, and there is no common alternative to just saying “orange”. In lime’s case, the color is indeed named after the fruit, *but* the common alternative is “light green”/“dark green” (whichever one you refer to as ‘lime’.

I think that we can all agree that our society has objectified women for a long time. Women are victims of a lot of stuff and a movement called Feminism has been created to make women equal to men.

Normally I would stay out of the conversation and watch it from afar, but these extremists feminists have crossed the line when they started blaming men for sexualization of women. This issue has many causes and so I don't think that you can just blame men. 

I believe that the sexualization is caused by these: Social media, porn, modern music, not having space for each gender.(and some more)

**Social Media:** 

We can all agree that social media is unhealthy in plenty of ways : promotes a fake ""financial freedom lifestyle"", fake image of the ideal woman etc. Big breast and butt, pretty face, etc. These days, you can go see tons of girls who are trying so hard to be like those Instagram models they see. It's unhealthy for women and men.Young girls are having an image in their head of what a ""baddie"" looks like and they they wanna replicate it. They go have surgery, dress in a provocative way, use filters etc.  They're not being themselves at all. And all of this hits men really hard. They see all those beautiful girls everyday, and it just makes them have the idea that a hot girl looks like ""this"" or ""that"". They begin to sexualize women, since all they see is girls trying to be hot online and after that, they get the blame. 

I think that social media is used in an unhealthy way these days.

***mini tl;dr*** : Social media is at fault because it makes young girls sexualize themselves by trying to be like those intagram models which then makes guys sexualize them. And at the end guys get the blame.

&#x200B;

**Porn:** 

We can all agree that porn isn't healthy for young men who have little to no experience in life. After watching porn, they think that having a girl is all about sex. They completely forget about love. They see the girls in the videos smiling at them calling them ""daddy"" which is just terrible for their mental health. If you have experience in life and want to watch porn once in a while, do it, but teens who haven't experienced anything yet shouldn't watch. It gives them a false reality that really hurts women in the long run.

&#x200B;

**Modern Music: (biased)**

I don't know how it got to this point, but these days a lot of songs are sexualized. Especially music videos. 6ix9ine for example, will have girls twerking in his music videos for no reason. Like, why? Nicki Minaj, Cardi B, Megan,etc will have that ""ideal"" body and have a career that is based on their body. Why do you sexualize yourselves so much? What's cool about it? Women get all the consequences for absolutely no reason. It promotes that unhealthy way of sexualizing women all the time. And I don't even know how to people listen to that kind of music. It's just softcore porn. It has the same effect as social media.

I also have talked to people who said that these women ""empower"" them. Like... whut? I don't understand how girls can think that artists who base their entire career on sexualizing their body is some sort of ""empowerment"".

&#x200B;

**Not having space for each gender:**

I think this one is the most devastating out of all the ones I've mentioned. We don't have enough space for dedicated genders. 

Sometimes, guys need some place for only men, so that they can talk about their issues, feel like they belong to a group and forge their identity. This is so important for men and women, but it is completely disregarded and viewed as sexism. 

Men these days are alone, unless you already got your group of friends, but not everyone has that. The weak are often the one who do the bad things to women as they are desperate. They need a group of guys to support them and show them the example. They need a big brother or a father.

When a girl enters a group of guys, their behaviour changes. They are now in competition to see who can go out with the new girl, which again, unhealthy behaviour. This is the only reason why I'm against mixed genders in sports.

When I was in highschool, there was a girls' club where girls could talk about their issues and feel some sort of comfort and some sort of ""2nd home"".  I thought it was a really great concept. But when guys asked for one, the school never created one. Guys have asked for one every single year, but never got it.

Just to clarify, I'm not against guys being in the same room as girls, I just think that guys and girls should have time for themselves so that they can be supported and understood by people like them.

**Conclusion:**

So these are my thoughts on why women are being victims of constant sexualization. These should be adressed instead of blaming men as I feel like they are the root of the problem.  I tried my best to keep it as short as possible. Feel free to change my view.",changemyview

CMV: in the UK it should be written in law that a General Election must be held whenever there is a change in leadership of the governing party.,0,j5ggbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j5ggbb/cmv_in_the_uk_it_should_be_written_in_law_that_a/,18,2020-10-05 17:39:30,"The UK is of course a representative democracy where we vote for the party that we would like to be in power. In theory, you could expect that a party would broadly have similar policies and aims irrespective of who the leader is, simply because they are members of a party which itself is based on a range of values that party members/MPs share.

Over the past few years there have been two changes of leadership of the Conservative party which have all been followed by a General Election (GE). However, these elections did not HAVE to happen purely because of these changes in leadership.

There are arguably drastically different interpretations of what the ""true"" values of the major English political parties are (I don't know anything about the SNP). For example, in the Conservative party we have the One Nation faction as well as the European Research Group faction. In the Labour party we have ""Corbynistas"" and ""Blairites""/""Red Tories"". Lastly, in the Liberal Democrats we have the Orange Book Club and Beveridge group.

I'll refrain from highlighting the differences between these factions here.

Harking back to the 2017 GE as an example, imagine if Jeremy Corbyn won and became Prime Minister, but then a couple of years on Keir Starmer became leader and PM (for some reason irrelevant to this example) and he was in power until 2022?

The furor shown by the left wing faction of Labour when Keir became leader I think is indicative of what would happen, at a minimum, if the above scenario had occured. I strongly believe that similar ""disquiet"" would be shown by members of any of the 3 main English parties. One could argue that the uproar shown by the Labour members would not be the same if Labour were in fact in power, as members/Momentum/MPs may just stay quiet. I'm just using this as an example to illustrate my point.

The fact that intra-party factions even exist in the first place is self evident of the significance of the differing opinions/philosophies within the parties.

Ultimately, if the voting population still believed in the values and policies being extolled by the governing party regardless of the current leader, then this would be reflected in the outcome of a GE.

On the above basis I firmly believe that a GE should be held in response to a change of leadership of the governing party, as a legal requirement.

There are a couple of points I anticipate being raised by commenters:

*What about a change of leadership in times of crisis?*

For the purposes of this CMV I would prefer to disregard this scenario. My CMV and opinion pertains to ""normal"" times.

*At what point following the leadership announcement should the GE be held?*

This is a tricky one. Because, equally, there is no legal obligation for a party/party leader to set out their policy objectives within a certain timeframe of being appointed leader. My initial thoughts on a timeframe would be perhaps after the next party conference or some time around the Queen's speech where policy objectives are normally announced. 

But again, for the purposes of this CMV, I wish to assume that there is in fact a well defined time after a new party leader has been appointed when policy goals are announced. This is so that my opinion can be challenged purely on the statement in the title of the post.

Thank you.

now, i don't beleive in ""defund the police"", that's dumb as hell. but i do believe there needs to be some fund reappropriating. i vouch for more research into nonlethal options.

firstly, tasers. they're unreliable. the leads sometimes won't connect be it through contact or clothing, some people are stronger than others, etc. they are so unreliable that police should really only use them if they have LETHAL BACKUP. this means if you're out alone, you shouldn't have a taser. which makes for very bad situations if someone happens to have a hair comb. my heart is out to that poor soul.

guns are cheap as hell and work since we've been developing them for so long. tasers only recently have started development and are basically in the ""musket stage"" of things. 

in a PERFECT WORLD, the police should be able to snap their fingers and the criminal is in handcuffs in a courtroom. no need for lethal. and things like beanbag shots cost a lot, which mind you defunding the police would NOT help with. besides they can be bulky and are not usually carried.

In the abortion debate we have two rational sides. One values the conceived life and considers ending it bad. As we are wired to consider ourselves good no matter what, doing something bad is irrational and thus unacceptable. The other might even value the conceived life as well, but considers the harm that lack of availability of abortion does to society and individuals to be bad, irrational and thus unacceptable.

The loudest argument of pro-abortion side is bodily autonomy. I find this argument to be mute, leaving the correlated statistics of crime, poverty and mortality the main argument in favor of abortion, which is still valid. A woman surrenders her bodily autonomy in the act of giving consent for sexual intercourse which extends to the consequences. This automatically makes abortion in cases of rape allowable.

I consider the above argument to be an attempt at claiming a moral high ground in the debate because superposing cold statistics of crime, poverty and mortality associated with lack of availability of abortion against killing of children will hardly win anyone's approval. But the main argument of the anti-abortion side is also not absolute. Few would order a woman to die in childbirth needlessly, especially if the child would not survive, thus allowing abortion in cases when the mother is at risk. At the same time auto-abortion occurs naturally and frequently without the would-be-mothers knowing they were ever pregnant, thus early abortion while a serious matter, is not unacceptable since it happens so often without any consequences.

Finally we have the silent side of the debate: the fathers. If a man finds out of conception he has every right to be ecstatic, happy, to imagine the future of his child, start picking a name for them, planning how their room will look like. Can you conceive the woman saying ""nope, not having it"" in such a scenario without choking on tears? This obviously does not apply in case of rape and the value of life of the mother trumps the hopes of that of a child but abortion should not be allowed without the consent of the father. If the father does not give consent but the mother does not want it, then the father should be the sole caregiver with the financial support from the mother.

&#x200B;

To summarize:

Abortion should always be available in cases of rape.

Abortion should be available in cases where mother is at risk.

Outside the first two, the consent of the father is necessary.

Additionally in order to minimize the phenomena at the source everyone should receive complete education and free access to related resources.

PS: At the end I am realizing that I argued myself into a pro-abortion stance with the inclusion of fathers rights.

"CMV: It is still not understood whether cannabis can ""activate"" latent mental illness (of which a person was already predisposed) or whether it can ""cause"" mental illness itself (i.e. cases where it would have been unlikely for a person to develop said mental illness if they hadn't used cannabis).",7,j5e00a,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j5e00a/cmv_it_is_still_not_understood_whether_cannabis/,11,2020-10-05 13:39:10,"I often see it argued that people who may be predisposed to certain mental conditions (e.g psychosis) should avoid the use of cannabis, along with other drugs like LSD or Psilocybin, since the drugs can ""trigger"" or ""activate"" latent conditions and bring them to the surface. This point is usually made in contrast with the idea that these drugs actually *cause* those mental illnesses themselves. In other words, the argument is essentially ""if you are not already predisposed, then they will not 'create' the illness""

I see many issues with this argument. 

(1) One can only make this distinction by performing an experiment where one group is known to be ""high risk"" for mental illness and another group ""low risk"", and then observing the results of cannabis use in both groups (I understand this is overly simplified). Since this kind of experiment is, frankly, unethical, it is not surprising that I haven't seen anything like this conducted.

(2) Without an experiment, there is no way to actually know whether or not a person who developed a mental illness after using cannabis was ""predisposed"" already, or whether or not the cannabis created a condition that the person likely would not have had if they hadn't used cannabis.

(3) There isn't a good way for a person to know whether or not they are ""predisposed"" to a condition before they try cannabis for the first time, other than ""proxy"" indicators like family history. Just using family history as a predictor seems like an over-simplification that can miss a great number of other indicators of whether or not someone may be susceptible to a latent mental illness. Therefore, trying cannabis is higher risk than most people let on.

CMV: Taxing the rich will only incentivize them to move out of the country (or their business),88,j5dr9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j5dr9m/cmv_taxing_the_rich_will_only_incentivize_them_to/,81,2020-10-05 13:17:59,"Edit: View changed. Thank you guys for demonstrating that the rich moving away from where they laid their groundwork is pretty asinine when you think about it.

=============================================

This is something I wanted to share and I'm hoping some of you can convince me otherwise on why this is a bad idea. Now, taxing the rich is something I can endorse, but here's why I think this is a bad idea.

First, after seeing the Biden ad (like we're not getting tired of the political ads at this point) with him promising that he's only going to raise taxes on those making over $400,000 per year. Sounds good to me, I'll probably never make that kind of money in my life, so why should I care, right? But there's just one main problem that I'm thinking of: If you tax the rich, isn't that going to incentivize them to move out of the country into a tax haven, like Switzerland, Hong Kong, Singapore, etc.? If not themselves, then surely their businesses. I'm assuming of course, that this promise is going to affect income taxes which the rich hardly pay if they own a business. If they're making wages at their own business, that's active income but since they own the business, the profit they make is passive income so wouldn't that policy be affecting active income only? If it's affecting both types of income, that would surely incentivize someone to move their business elsewhere.

The problem with this is once the rich have fled America, assuming Joe Biden wins the election, the policy will shift so that middle-class Americans and the poor will have to pay rich people taxes in order to keep the flow of money going in the government, and where does that money end every time? In your senator's pocket, or your other state/county representatives. The wealthy will see this move as a punishment for being successful, because if I were worth $50 billion dollars, and all of a sudden I have to give 80% of my money to the government, then I could simply say ""Screw this, I'm moving to Switzerland"", you know why? Because unlike almost all of the country, I can do that on a whim.

Since I'm not wealthy, however and I'm stating an example, I and many of you don't have the luxury of moving elsewhere to preserve our nonexistent wealth, while the elite 1% do. After they've gone, and their businesses, goods, and services have left the country with them, it would turn from a punishment for being wealthy into a punishment for being poor. I'd cite personal experiences in which I was punished for being poor regardless of administration because the extortion happened on a local/citywide level, but that's probably irrelevant.

If you tax the rich at egregious amounts, they'll move to a country or area where they're not so heavily taxed leaving the middle class and the impoverished to make up the deficit.

From what I understand, there was a brief story outline for a third Dark Knight film including more of Ledger's Joker character. Nolan's decision to discard this was understandable, but ultimately the wrong choice in my opinion. 

The Joker is usually the ying to Batman's yang and this version of the character seemed to be no different. One of the last things he says is literally ""I think you and I are destined to do this forever."" The ending to The Dark Knight appeared to almost promise to continue to explore the dynamic between the two characters with that line. Not only would the next film have benefited from another appearance by Joker, but it's possible the series could have continued into a fourth and maybe fifth film as well.

It would have been extremely hard to recast the character, but not impossible. Ledger was undeniably talented, but Joaquin Phoenix literally won an Oscar earlier this year playing a (admittedly very different) version of the character. After Ledger won a posthumous Oscar himself there would have been no shortage of talented actors offering to take up the role.

The USA is already suffering forest fires, heat waves and other natural disasters. People are going to start migrating north to more template weather and specially for fresh water.

It would be naive to think the US government hadn't planned to quickly take over Canada's fresh water and power generation facilities if/when needed.

It will be done with either economic oppression or outright military intervention, because Canada has no hope of resisting the USA.

And given the history of US imperialism, canadians really don't want to be in that position.

That's why they need nukes to stop any ideas the US government might have in the coming environmental crisis.

They control basically all the territory they want, and Russia would not be enthusiastic about aiding them if it came out that Armenia had started this skirmish. Azerbaijan can regain de facto control of Nagorno-Karabakh if there is a war and it goes well.

CMV: The Best Way to Replace Entrenched (& Corrupt) Politicians like Mitch McConnell is for the Opposing Party to Support a Candidate From the Sitting Politician's Party,3,j51wa9,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j51wa9/cmv_the_best_way_to_replace_entrenched_corrupt/,39,2020-10-05 00:37:09,"This is an idea I've been considering on and off ever since I became more politically aware, and have now given a great deal more thought since Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away and Mitch McConnell declared his intent to approve whatever nominee Trump brings forth, contrary to his statements & actions back in 2016. Now, let me make this clear - I am not interested in debating whether all this is legal or not, if it is hypocritical or not, whatever... I've made up my mind in regards to that particular bit of chaos and I'm not really interested in changing my view on it. What I want to discuss is detailed below:

In the United States, we have several politicians who have become so entrenched in their office and power that even though they are greatly disliked by the people they (supposedly) represent, they still get re-elected time after time again. To be more specific, I am referring to Mitch McConnell. He has been a US Senator for nearly 36 years now, and is expected to be re-elected for a 7th term this coming election. He also has one of the worst home state approval ratings for any US Senator, with a large number of those people being from his own party.

Now, the Democratic Party has nominated Amy McGrath as their candidate against McConnell. And while I think she did pretty well all things considered, it seems highly unlikely that she's going to win. And I think many of us would agree that one of the major reasons why is because many, many people vote purely on party lines. It has become something of a cultural norm for some communities... There are people out there who say they voted for (insert party) because their family and friends did, that it went back generations, yada yada. These people do not even consider the other side, do not look into the opposing side's views (which may actually be more in-line with their interests than the current person in power), even if they hate their current sitting senator. It just comes down to Red vs Blue, Democrat vs Republican, and that they have to support the party they've always supported.

This is why I think a good tactic against all this would be to have the opposing side support candidates that are from the sitting politician's party. For Kentucky, this would mean nominating and supporting a Republican instead of a Democrat. I know it seems controversial, but the goal here isn't to flip the state's ""colors"", but to remove from office an entrenched politician, one who is notorious for not being willing to compromise (as evident from the hundreds of bills he's let die on his desk), and replace him with someone who is more flexible and willing to hear the other side. I also think that by doing that, the country might learn to get along again... assuming we haven't destroyed it first.

So, that's my view and I am open to it being changed, refined, or outright shot down - The best tactic for any political party to remove a politician who is too powerful and disliked is to support a candidate from that party. This obviously requires political positions that are elected via popular vote.  CMV",changemyview

Although i object to that number, i do see the reasoning behind it, ie being too uninformed to be effective. I think equally, if not even moreso, this should apply to a maximum age as well.

Using Joe biden as an example, the man is 34 years past the median age of the state with the highest median age (maine, 43). This is close to double the median at best. 

There is effectively no way the man (or any older candidate) could possibly be in touch with the issues facing most of the country. This is only going to become a larger and larger divide as time goes on and quicker advances in technology create larger gaps of understanding between age groups.

Beyond this, there are more practical reasons such as straight up dying in office from old age. Again using biden as an example, hes less than 1.5years away from hitting the life expectancy of a male in the usa. Obviously a man in such a position would have a higher life expectency than the average, but come on. Its the white house, not a nursing home. Almost no person in his 60s/70s will perform mentally or physically as well as on their 40s/50s. And the country shouldn't have to undergo a transition of power because some geriatric decided to run for office in his twilight years.

China controls the majority of HK's fresh water supply since HK’s reservoirs don’t have the capacity to supply the entire population. Cutting off potable water would be the first political maneuver.

China supplies a large portion of HK's meat and vegetables and if China were to cut off that supply, importing food from other countries would be more expensive. HK already imports a lot of food but the average price is kept low by importing cheaper options from China. China could even cut off air and sea routes to HK since they have de factor control over the South China Sea. Currently, HK's empty land is mostly mountains which would make it unsuitable for rice agriculture.

Without affordable sources of food and water, it would be difficult for HK to maintain independence.

HK's electricity comes from several sources including electricity generated from burning coal in HK, electricity purchased from China and also electricity from a power plant partially owned by a HK company but located in China. China could cut off several of HK’s sources of electricity and prevent coal deliveries to HK therefore preventing HK from functioning properly, at least in the short term.

HK's main source of income, in no particular order, are:

1. Taxes paid by multinational corporations located in HK.
2. Taxes paid by financial institutions operating in HK.
3. Taxes paid by local businesses and citizens.
4. Tourism.
5. Profits made by selling land owned by the government.

If HK were to be annexed from China, the multinational corporations that target the China market would have no reason to remain in HK.

The financial institutions that mainly target China including investment companies (since 70% of foreign investments in China are funneled through HK) as well as companies that deal with the offshore Yuan currency would have no reason to remain in HK.

Mainland China tourists historically make up the majority of tourists entering HK ever since the financial collapse in 1998. Independence would mean tourism from Mainland China would stop entirely.

Without a minimal level of tourism, shops would not afford to pay rent (since rents are still high) and would close down causing even fewer tourists to want to visit HK. This would start a downward spiral for the tourism industry.

If the loss of companies and tourism cause job losses and if those job losses cause emigration, then land demand would fall and government revenue through land sales would fall.

HK's independence would not necessarily be recognized by international bodies since China has veto power in most international organizations. China's clout could prevent other countries from trading with HK and since HK doesn’t have a large enough population for other countries to accept the political backlash in exchange for selling goods to HK, those countries would find it more beneficial to stop trading with HK altogether.

Since China controls the sea route in the South China Sea, China could also cut the Internet cables that supply Internet access to HK. With only satellite Internet access left, Internet costs would go up and might slow down. Without the Internet, HK's ability to function would be affected.

In the end, HK's ability to function  independently like Taiwan or Singapore in terms of their economic independence and sustainability is not as easy as it seems.",changemyview

CMV: The recent increase in the popularity of sports betting is a problematic form of toxic masculinity,0,j4rnhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j4rnhk/cmv_the_recent_increase_in_the_popularity_of/,37,2020-10-04 10:37:53,"Hi CMV, 

This is a view I've been developing for a while as both a man and a lover of sports. Over the last few years, I've seen several of my close friends get sucked into this extremely addictive cycle of sports gambling. Some have gone as far as to open illegal books, participate in illicit gambling, owe people significant money, and wasting money they should have used for other purposes to gamble on games that, quite honestly, nobody who isn't a fan of specific teams would ever give a shit about. If they weren't betting $5-15 on sports a few times a week and instead going to the casino and playing blackjack weekly, it would obviously be seen as a real addiction.

Personally, I do like betting on the occasional game. It's now legal where I live and I have the disposable income to do it every once in a while. I generally tend to bet on big games, like the NBA finals happening over the next few weeks. I also play fantasy football and basketball which I don't really think apply here because that's much more interactive and is a good way to stay in touch with friends.

More to the point; I think toxic masculinity applies here for a number of specific reasons which I'll list below. As a general principle, I have a pretty lenient view on toxic masculinity in the sense that I think the term is widely overused, but I do strongly believe it's a real thing and have little interest debating that unless it's necessary for your arguments.

1. Historically, gambling has always caused problematic relationships between men and women, particularly those in relationships. There is a long, well documented history of gambling addictions that tear apart families and couples. Now, I'm no Quaker, but the degree to which sports betting is being promoted as a cool guy thing is very toxic and against solid morals. 

2. Many sports gamblers are absolutely addicted and refuse to acknowledge it. Failing to accept flaws in personality and mental health are core tenets of toxic masculinity. The refusal to ask for and receive help also fits into this definition of toxic masculinity. 

3. By definition, toxic masculinity pushes men to take risks that they should not take. Not much else to say on this.

4. Sports should be enjoyed for the sake of enjoying them. I find it toxic to feel the need to insert yourself into a game that has nothing to do with you. If you otherwise wouldn't be interested in a game, betting on it should not be how you gain interest. Again, it's one thing to think you'll make it big by betting on the Super Bowl or something, but if, for example, you're not normally a fan and betting weekly on parlays involving bad, unwatchable teams like the NY Jets, the Detroit Tigers, and Wolverhampton, that's toxic. You're just trying to force interest in boring games by putting your own money on the line in some toxic desire to win when you otherwise have nothing riding on these games. 

5. The internal need to earn fast cash through frequent gambling applies the tenet of toxic masculinity involving the search for social status and money. Men commonly feel unfulfilled and inadequate if they're unable to earn ""enough"" money through normal means, and they will thus seek other, much riskier avenues for financial and social status. 

I could go on and on but I feel like I'd get repetitive as the list got too long. What I'm arguing here in short is that there's suddenly this huge market for sports betting and it relies on and exacerbates toxic masculinity. Now that it's becoming legal in more places than just Vegas or other common gambling places, too many men have become borderline addicted to it. And it doesn't help that iconic cultural influences like Barstool and even fucking ESPN are glorifying and advertising it. 

I'm not here to call for regulations or new laws or anything like that. I just think sports betting exemplifies many of the core tenets of toxic masculinity and men need to be more careful and aware of how chronic gambling can affect their behavior, even when it seems as harmless as throwing $5 on a few basketball games.

CMV: There's no rational reasons for players to hate the smart pistol in Titanfall 2 as much as they do.,15,j4rilq,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j4rilq/cmv_theres_no_rational_reasons_for_players_to/,13,2020-10-04 10:27:41,"I finally got Titanfall 2 when it came to steam after wanting it for so long, and it's awesome. I was doing fairly well (consistently top 3 in score on my team) even before I unlocked the smart pistol. However in about 30%-40% of the games I've been in since I started using the smart pistol, I've had players in chat complain about it. I haven't had anyone else complain about me killing them with any other weapon and I've only seen someone complain about someone else's gameplay as an individual for non smart pistol reasons once. 

I know that one person complaining in 30%-40% of games isn't a lot of people because that's around one person in every three games. With six enemy players, that's about one out of eighteen players, which isn't a lot. But then again, that's how many players I encounter that have enough energy to complain in the chat. I don't know know how many more players get annoyed or otherwise dislike the weapon but don't care to complain about it per match, but seeing how the smart pistol is the butt of jokes in the community for being the low skill noob boost, I think it's a decent chunk of players I encounter.

But I can't think of a rational reason for it to be that way. I had two of my own theories, but I don't think either of them hold water. 

**Theory 1:** It doesn't require skill to use, it's just a flat advantage.

The problem is, all other boosts are just flat advantages.

\-Amped weapons is effectively an aim advantage. It makes you do more damage per shot, which means you need to land fewer shots on target to win that engagement. The difference is that it requires you land at least a shot and it is on a timer to shoot as many times as you want where as the smart pistol requires you to wait to lock and is limited by number of shots.

\-Ticks and both the sentry guns are just extra AI on the battlefield that do more damage. The pilot sentry is basically an extra player with a smart pistol that is limited by being stationary. 

\-Radar jammer and map hack both give your team a flat information advantage which either make it harder for the enemy team or easier for your team to pre-aim and position. Holopilot is also an information advantage, but instead giving/denying useful information, it gives the enemy more useless information to parse, giving you a window to make the engagement advantageous for yourself and possibly making them reload or waste an ability.

\-Phase rewind just flat lets you reset the engagement.

\-Hard cover lets you shoot at someone while they can't shoot at you from a specific angle, giving you both a positioning advantage and an effective aim advantage because you can afford to miss a shot or two before the enemy moves to somewhere they can actually shoot back.

\-Battery back-up gives your titan more hitpoints.

One might counter that many of the abilities listed above require skill in some other aspect of the game to be the most effective with them. I agree. Hard cover requires good map sense and positioning to know where to put it effectively, amped weapons requires the player to have \*some\* aim and the game sense to not be killed and have it reset, etc...

But the smart pistol also has it's limitations. It has a hard cutoff distance where it doesn't target, so it's useless for long range engagements (not even sniper rifle long range, the cut off is closer than some of the shots I'd feel confident taking with the starting assault rifle). It has an soft cutoff on how close you can get too, as if you get within hipfiring range of most weapons, most weapons will be able spray down a target with a smart pistol faster than the smart pistol can target and get its rounds into the other pilot.  It is also easier break the smart pistol's targeting as you need to travel less distance to get out of it's targeting cone. 

Even when you're in optimal range, having the positioning and/or movement advantage is important to have because you can't inflict damage on the enemy or look away from them while the pistol targets, while the enemy can immediately fire back or turn, break targeting, and reengage while you have to start the lock process again.

Where hard cover needs good map and game sense, ticks need good timing and windows of opportunity, and holopilot needs good awareness to be the most effective, the smart pistol needs good positioning and movement to be the most effective. 

**Theory 2:** It lacks counterplay options. 

Counterplay in game design is important because if you lose, and you do so in a way you couldn't have possibly countered, it feels really unfair and takes the fun out of it. However, I don't think this is a problem with the smart pistol.

Respawn times in Titanfall 2 are pretty fast to begin with, so not as much is at stake if you lose an engagement. Along with that, you can still have lots of fun and get lots of experience on the losing team, so losing the match as a whole isn't that big a deal compared to something like a MOBA where you spent the last hour of your life losing because someone made a mistake early on and it snowballed. 

Along with that, the smart pistol gives enemy pilots the ""player locking"" warning so they get a heads up. Snipers, melee attacks, and shotguns can just one shot you without warning if you don't see the player looking at you. This warning gives you some time where, if you aren't caught out in the total open, you can look for cover to reset the lock (and if you are out in the total open with no cover, that's bad positioning regardless of what the enemy is shooting at you with). 

And lastly, dying to the smart pistol is just about as fast as dying to almost any other weapon. You have control of your character until you hit zero, and then you respawn. Executions on the other hand will ""effectively"" kill the player by making them sit through a long annoying animation before they die and go through the respawning process. Sure, you can technically have a teammate kill the enemy pilot during a pilot animation, but that depends on them seeing you being executed (which if there were a chance of that happening, a good player wouldn't try to execute you). There is no counter to the titan animation for the player being executed other than don't get executed to begin with, and they get punished by having their respawn time effectively increased while they watch their titan and pilot get brutally murdered. 

In conclusion, I think the smart pistol is shat on too hard by the community as being the game's ""ez mode"". I only have 30 hours of experience in multiplayer, so I don't know precisely how viable it is compared to other boosts, but it couldn't be insanely over powered because people take other boosts all the time (if it were that op, 'honor' wouldn't stop everyone from using it), and it is far from the worst offender in terms of least fun weapon/ability to play against. A player shouldn't be looked down upon for using it any more than a player should be looked down upon for using any other boost.",changemyview

• The first part seems pretty obvious Egypt is in Africa. So it's an African civilization why people debate me on this I do not know.

• There are a lot of similarities between Ancient Egyptian culture and religion and other African cultures. The religion for example is disimilar from those in the Middle east and similar to those from Africa. 

• The Ancient Egyptian language is an branch of the African language Afro-asiatic.

• The Ancient Egyptian civilization started in the south, Upper Egypt. This is also the part of Egypt which has the most connections to it's southern neigbours the Nubians and Ethiopians.

• The people of Ancient Egypt were made up of different peoples of the green Sahara ranging from light North Africans, very dark Nilotic people, Brown Afro-asiatic people and non-Africans.

I have more reasons but these facts are the basis of my belief. Just to clarify I am not arguing that every single Egyptian was black or even African. I believe the culture, the religion and the people of Ancient Egypt all had their roots in Africa.

"CMV: The current US presidential debate format is pretty bad, regardless of which candidates are running.",47,j4n712,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j4n712/cmv_the_current_us_presidential_debate_format_is/,14,2020-10-04 05:32:25,"Recently, people have been talking about how bad the most recent Presidential debate was. And its true that this debate was particularly bad. However, generally speaking, the debates have always been pretty bad, at least in living memory. 

In a proper debate, debaters should get 10 to 15 minutes to make an opening statement. They should then be given a slightly shorter period in which to respond to their opponent's statement. They should not be able to interrupt at all. There shouldn't be a back and forth. 

Instead, the debates resemble the types of exchanges you see on cable news. Candidates are given an extremely small amount of time to express their views, and they are then encouraged to have an argumentative exchange with their opponent. You can't intelligently articulate views this way. 

This format ensures that any conversation is going to be fairly shallow. Candidates are going to compete for air time in an effort to get the best sound bites and the most cutting zingers. This is the type of ""debate"" you would expect to see on Fox News or CNN. 

Speaking of which, the major cable news channels are entertainment companies. As such, they should clearly not be running the debates. The debates should be run by nonpartisan institutions, such as a panel of university officials, legal societies, and/or professional associations. The moderator should be non entity in the debate. They should ask neutral questions, and be otherwise quiet/innocuous. If candidates break the rules, they should simply have their mikes cut off. It shouldn't be the job of a TV personality to argue with them. 

There also shouldn't be an audience. This wasn't an issue in this most recent debate. But, in the past, candidates have played to the crowd in an attempt to elicit crowd reactions. The presence of a crowd does not encourage a sober intellectual discussion. 

Additionally, the focus of the debates should be fairly constrained. They should not be jumping between a wide array of topics. If we have 3 debates, then they should each focus on a different subject matter. Perhaps one could be about the economy, one could be about national security, and one could be about social issues. You might adjust the themes depending on whatever issues are most pressing. 

That's how a proper debate should be conducted. If we want to give the candidates an opportunity to intelligently articulate their views, then that's how it should be done. 

Its just so obvious that our debates are run stupidly. Its indefensible. Its beyond me how anyone seriously justifies this debate format. 

Its widely agreed that the most recent debate was particularly bad. But, beyond that, the debates are fundamentally flawed. They do not create an environment in which candidates are encouraged to have sober intellectual discussions. They are clearly designed by entertainment companies to create a spectacle and drive ratings. They are a national embarrassment.",changemyview

And I don't see any strong arguments against it as of now.


The argument:
Voting is a fundamental part of a working democracy. The more people voting, the stronger the democracy is. If you do not agree with any party you could always give a blank vote, so ""not wanting to vote,"" or ""not believing in voting"" isn't something that is a direct problem.

Introducing a law that regulates this is the only way to make sure that it works. It is probable that the inconvenience of paying a fine (let's say $50 just to have a number) will be enough to encourage people to vote. 

If you are unable to vote for any reason, a few reasons being eligible (like being hospitalised), you would not recieve a fine.


The anti-argument:
What about free will? You should have the right to choose, this includes the choice of voing in the first place. Well, an argument against this is that voting doesn't hurt anyone, it is only beneficial towards the free democracy.

What about voter secrecy? If you get a fine for not voting, that could compromise the secrecy if people found out. Well, maybe, and this is a fine argument. But the secrecy is about WHO you are voting for, not IF you are voting. As a matter of fact, this might also encourage people to vote, since it would become a norm in society to do so.

"CMV: Religious american conservatives / right wingers obsession with capitalism and other ""amercian values"" is incompatible with their nearly fundamentalist take on ""Christianity""",9936,j4iji6,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j4iji6/cmv_religious_american_conservatives_right/,744,2020-10-04 00:58:19,"I'm gonna focus on some key principles that I think are important in Christianity, but are basically ignored by some ""religious"" Amercian conservatives when they argue against things like healthcare, welfare, immigration, or in favor of guns or military intervention and death penalty (punishment in general). I'm genuinely interested in how the worldview of these people is. 



The main thing I base my assumptions on are known ""facts"" about Jesus himself / how he is characterized and how he should be a role model for Christians. Everyone knows, that he is supposed to be nice, peaceful, selfless, altruistic, helping others and not interested in financial gain or profit (I believe he was quoted in saying something like ""don't praise the money""). 


So then, if you praise this person and act like you live according to his standards, why would you be so obsessed with bashing every government program, that is about helping poor people? They not only reject any step in that direction, they also enthusiastically argue against it. How can you justify the ""everybody on his own"" attitude, that people who get sick either die or become homeless because of hospital bills, and blame them for their life choices, instead of trying to set up a system that would help them? Even if it would mean that some amount of the money you worked for would go to somebody else, shouldn't you as a religious person be okay with it? Wouldn't it be fitting your narrative of having tried to do the noble thing? 



Another issue is the tribalism that you find in these communities, where there is prejudice and scepticism if non white people are immigrating to their country, not only because letting in immigrants seeking a better life would be helping others (which would totally be a ""Jesus"" thing to do) but also because Jesus himself probably wasn't white, he was middle eastern, so how do they justify their narrow focus on people with european ancestry, when their ""role model"" wasn't that?



The next topic is their stance on guns and military intervention. I assume that Jesus would have been a pacifist, so why do you never hear those people complain about military spending and all the interventions they are doing? Do they think Jesus would be in favor of going to war with a country like Vietnam or having coup d'etats in South Amercia? Correct me if I'm wrong but as far as I know they are mostly in favor of military operations of the US and are very sceptic about people who critique anything relating to the ""troops"" right? And what is with the obsession with guns in their culture, do they think that Jesus would be a ""gun guy"" and a NRA supporter? That he also would talk happily about how home invaders deserve instant death and how important these tools are, which only have the purpose of hurting / killing? Regardless,of how you judge the home invader situation, I think as a ""religious"" person you shouldn't be that enthusiastic about homicide, no matter how much the person deserved it or how much you thought it's justified, even if it is necessary for your survival, the way some people talk about this with this non mercy attitude as if they are just waiting to shoot someone is completely the opposite of Christianity.


My last point is their stance towards punishment / death penalty. It's obvious what the contradiction in regards to the death penalty would be, but also the ""punishment over rehabilitation"" stance that they take feels so wrong, do you really think that, for example Jesus as a judge would be okay with locking up somebody for stealing as much as possible instead of trying to rehabilitate this person?  Why would you as a christian put revenge over forgiveness, I'm not even a christian and I think it would be obvious which one is the christian way and which not, so why do these people dont see it?




In summary, I believe that these people don't really care about Christianity, they use it when it fits them but abandon it when it would do something that doesn't fit their ""amercian"" narrative, because in my opinion these contradictions are too big to ignore, so either you are intentionally ignorant or they don't really believe in Christianity",changemyview

Chemicals which were call bad drugs were actually real medicines, depending on who sold it. I experimented with some in small amounts. Not because I was depressed, not because I was a fool, but because I started thinking that life has lied to me. I knew plenty of people who did drugs, and they weren't screwups. None of them followed the stories of how touching a drug would get you instantly addicted and destroy your life from that point onward.

These moments are among the most profound experiences in my life. It is indescribable to someone who has never tried. It's like suddenly being able to see a new color, and the words do not exist to describe it to someone else.

I can see how these experiences may be tempting as a way to escape reality for people who are unhappy with their lives. But the vast majority of people do not and will not become addicted. Just like with everything else, moderation is key. I imagine parents that don't enjoy a certain food and never allow or gave their children a chance to try can easily get their children to think they don't like the food even though they've never tried. Imagine one of your favorite foods that your parents don't like, and how sad you'd feel if you never tried it for yourself.

I'll be honest, my experience of Sociology and Sociological Theories is limited to A Level Sociology and certain Modules in my BSc Degree. I'm not an expert.

There's a lot of talk regarding this Theory lately and some very interesting discussions. I think what is missing is this. 

The public reaction and advocacy for ALL societies to change due to this Theory. 

I've never seen a Theory described as so absolute correct nor so immune to critique.

When sociological theories get mainstream traction such as- Neo Marxism, Third Wave Feminism ect. We see the vocal supporters but we also see the critique of, not just the supporters, but the actual Sociological Theory.

There's valid discussions and debates- sure some supporters may be personally insulted ect but in the end it always comes back down to the context of that Sociological Theory, and the basic understanding and respect between people in societies that no sociological theory is 'absolutely correct'. People have the right to support or dislike certain Theories.

Most Western Societies certainly don't uphold certain Sociological Theories as 'the only correct one' nor adapt their societies purely because of this.

Yet supporters of CTR are advocating and demanding changes to societies based on this single Theory. And if it doesn't happen, then they take that as more 'proof' that this Theory is clearly 100% correct, right and non-supporters of it are bigoted and racist.

Critical Race Theory- despite having numerous valid critiques about the actual Theory. Saying critisism of this Theory does not seem 'allowed' in mainstream and there seems to be more and more importance being placed on this theory and adapting our societies to it regardless of how accurately this theory may or may not represent in certain contexts.

It's an American Theory in which it's creators and supporters feel this is accurate for American Society.That doesn't make it absolutely right for the rest of the entire world, nor should it be immune to critisism.

Example: The UK Education System is leaning and adapting to using CRT in classrooms

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.spiked-online.com/2020/07/09/keep-critical-race-theory-out-of-the-classroom/amp/

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/07/11/insidious-march-critical-race-theory-schools-may-breaking-law/amp/

Even in UK politics is jumping on board with supporting CRT: https://www-worldnewj-com.cdn.ampproject.org/wp/s/www.worldnewj.com/ben-bradley-why-i-refuse-to-take-part-in-re-education-that-tells-ordinary-people-they-are-racists/?amp&usqp=mq331AQRKAGYAevpkp-luYXorAGwASA%3D

I've been called a Racist, a Bigot, Ignorant, White Bitch for trying to talk about the Theory and Concepts this holds. Critisism of CRT does not seem to be allowed in mainstream these days.

That is a worrying problem.

I support certain Sociological concepts and Theories yet I'm not so arrogant to act as if my support/liking for certain theories means they are the absolute. I have critiqued what I support and can also accept the need for change and adaption. My support or non support of certain theories does not reflect my full personality nor how I act towards people.

Above all.

Theories adapt and change with time, different contexts ect.

Restricting CRT to only the current form, the utter refusal to allow critique of this theory and the growing push to make people accept this theory as the right way of thinking, is harming this theory and the entire area of Sociology as well.

Academics have published numerous insightful papers on CRT only to be decried by social media platforms ect as, 'racist'

No Theory is perfect. No Theory is Immune to Critique. Our societies certainly shouldn't be bending towards only this Theory and making it seem as this Theory is the only correct one. Nor should we be allowing abuse to others purely because they do not accept this Theory to be absolute.",changemyview

CMV: You don't deserve to be called antifascist if you're not willing to vote out the fascist,0,j4deht,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j4deht/cmv_you_dont_deserve_to_be_called_antifascist_if/,15,2020-10-03 18:14:17,"I think the title sums it up pretty neatly, but I'm going to clarify some details about my position.

While I'm obviously inspired by the situation in USA and I'm going to lean on that quite heavily, I'm not talking about any specific country of person. Specifically, I am not trying to argue that Trump (or Bolsonaro or anyone else) is actually fascist. What I'm saying (at this point, will clarify more bellow) is ""**If** you consider one of the major contenders for a political position to be fascist, **and** you consider yourself anti-fascist, **then** you have to vote (if you can, obviously), and you have to vote in a way that helps the goal of electing someone else that the fascist"". I will not specify what does 'major contender' mean, that's kinda fuzzy, but if the person is the incumbent, or if the race is down to two people (both literally, as in second round of two-round elections, or effectively, as in USA election), then they are a major contender.

Obviously, whenever there is any argument concerning the word 'fascism', there is automatically the problem of ""ask five people what fascism is and you get six different answers"". But since I believe most self-proclaimed antifascist people would agree that it's really bad, worse than almost any other political ideology, and that the longer it's in power, the harder it is to get rid of, I would argue that we don't have to specify exactly what it is and just leave it to the person in question.

Finally, you might argue that you don't allways have the power to actually do something. I kinda agree with that, but still pretty strictly. For example, if we take USA election, I agree that in many states your vote doesn't matter. (It affects popular vote, which makes some people care, but probably doesn't cause any actual change.) But I still think that if there is a reasonable uncertainity of who will win, then you must vote for the non-fascist. That includes for example Texas and Michigan. 

So I would finalize my statemant as ""**If** you consider one of the major contenders for a political position to be fascist (whatever that means for you), **and** you consider yourself anti-fascist, **and** you have a way to potentially reasonably affect the outcome of the election, **then** you have to vote, and you have to vote in a way that helps the goal of electing someone else that the fascist (if you can do that, of course).""

This argument came out of seeing some leftist americans, who claim that Trump is a fascist and that they are antifascist, refuse to vote for Biden (either voting for someone else, or just not voting). I get that if you consider Biden to be also fascist (I strongly disagree with this opinion, but it isn't the point of this post). I also get it if you live in a really solidely red or really solidely blue state. But if none of that is the case, then you are not antifascist, you're just a leftist who happens to sometimes support antifascism when it's convenient. 

(But I don't want to aim this on lefists - if Bernie won the primary, I'm sure I would see the same with some moderates. And I think that this kinda is what happened in Brazil during the last presidentil election, though my memory is kinda fuzzy on that.)",changemyview

I like George Takai, and what's resulted are a lot of lovely pictures of gay couples, but I would argue that this whole thing is actually hack trolling, and the people trying to ""own"" the Proud Boys in this way should be embarrassed.


Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against trolling the Proud Boys.  From what I understand, this is an organization founded on ""western chauvinism"", which appeals to alienated young men.  I have read that part of the initiation ritual is that the initiate has to [name their favorite breakfast cereals while they get beaten](https://www.myrecipes.com/extracrispy/why-the-proud-boys-initiation-ritual-involves-cereal), so clearly a part of this organization is about preparing themselves for violence.  If a group of people defending ""western civilization"" through violence is not [pretty darned fascist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturmabteilung), I don't know what is.


The think is, as far as I know, there is actually nothing homophobic about the Proud Boys, and there is no evidence their membership should be bothered in any way by this action.  As such I think it is a poor move for a number of reasons:

1. It's just bringing attention to their organization without causing them harm or anguish, which is kind of good for them - like if NPH actually came out as a Proud Boy, they would be thrilled by the high-profile association not bothered by the gay thing

2. It's actually a self-own, because it makes the assumption that people should be bothered by being associated with gay dudes - it's essentially using ""gay"" as an insult

3. It plays into this cancel culture narrative that left-wing people just put all right-wing people into a ""bad person"" bucket in an unjustified and clueless way

It's basically seems like going to a Spanish restaurant and trying to order Mexican food.  It's kind of close to making sense in some way, but actually it's just a display of ignorance.",changemyview
"CMV: Lena Dunham is not a racist, rape-apologist child molester and there is no reason to stop appreciating her works for these reasons",0,j4bvky,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j4bvky/cmv_lena_dunham_is_not_a_racist_rapeapologist/,26,2020-10-03 15:48:50,"Maybe i am a little late to this, but recently I took a lot of interest in Lena Dunham. For years I just knew her as some fat chick hated by everyone who is some kind of horrible human being and had a show that's like a millennial Sex & the City. After a recommendation from a good source, I decided to check out Girls, then I started loving Girls and through it her style of humour, observations etc. I saw Tiny Furniture and felt the same thing. I became interested in what this person has to say, so as the first step I decided to really look into why she is so hated (no doubt she is wealthy, accomplished and it is fair to criticize people - however if you look her up she isn't simply criticized, she is absolutely vilified and labeled by numerous sources as a horrible, racist human being and a child molester.)

I really did my research. Everything I read about the situation I will discuss now is from multiple  sources very critical of her, usually left-wing (the right-wing hatred of her boils down to her being fat, a feminist, and then sort of touching on the things left-wing hates her for too, so I decided to mostly focus on the left-criticisms), aside from her own quotes. I will now list few key situations and my opinions, and then sum it all up in conclusion.

**She molested her sister, she is a child predator** - Ok, this is just wrong. I am saying this not as her fan, just as someone who learned about this situation and who was once a child too. The exact accusation is that when she was 7 she spread apart her baby sister's vagina out of curiosity and found some pebbles in it. And when they were older and sharing a bed she would read, watch tv and masturbate with her sister sleeping next to her. I'm far from being incredibly open and ok with anything sexuality related, but to me this is all normal. The first case is simple child's curiosity, I did almost the same things with my cousins and friends. The latter is not such a big deal either, how does she harm her sister by masturbating while she sleeps? I doubt she was inserting a dildo in herself, it was probably silent rubbing under the covers, you don't even need to take your clothes of, it's really nothing that outrageous.

I read people condemning the fact that she referred to herself as a child predator but to me in the context it was obvious what Lena is talking about - she was making an exaggerated joke of the fact that she is needy for closeness and doesn't have many boundaries (which is kind of her thing she is self-aware and open about). People call her emotionally manipulative for pretending not to want to share a bed with her sister while she actually did, again, I see no big deal here. I could call my kid self a sexual predator jokingly, i tried to kiss other kids as well and see what they have down there. I wanted to marry my cousin. I know girls who wanted to marry their dads and tried to seduce them in bizarre ways imitating adult sexuality. I know sons who had phases of trying to grope their moms in ways that resemble sexual assault.  She was clearly pointing out how a young kid can unknowingly exhibit some behaviors that in an adult would be predatory, except clearly the fact we're talking about children makes the context completely different.

I am sure that some of her critics really didn't do these things and find them weird. I am also sure that today as a society we are more aware and more uncomfortable with this (parents were maybe uncomfortable before but not in a way where they knew how to confront it - my pretty liberal mom was trying to tell me not to masturbate in front of other people as a pre-school child but couldn't explain well to me why I was doing something inappropriate.) I think people now are more cautious which can be good (increased sensitivity in how they approach sexuality with kids), but also perhaps make fairly normal behaviours seem like a bigger deal than they are. And I think there is some general social discomfort, shame and dishonesty about the way people reacted to her ""confession"". I am giving a lot of focus to this section because i genuinely feel the way this topic was handled by others was very tone-deaf and void of any nuance, while I can expect it from the right, I am disappointed by the supposedly sensitive liberals who nitpick every word that might hurt someone but are ready to condemn a child/teen as a sex predator.

My main point here is that what most people seem to agree is that even if it was innocent it was still insensitive for her to talk about this topic, as if she is normalizing sexual assault. Well, after this reaction (as much as I am tired of calls to normalize anything), it seems to me someone should normalize child sexuality (not in a way that should be exploited by adults of course). Because it feels that in the eyes of the children who didn't experiment, masturbate or act like little pervs, a decent portion of us might end up feeling something was wrong with us. It's not exactly that people share these things, and for a long time I felt very weird about the fact that I started mastrubating as a toddler until I read that this is actually not that unusual. I feel that talking about these things and with some humor is actually refreshing and makes me feel more normal and understood. BTW - her sister also didn't think it was an issue, and neither did child psychologists who commented on it later.


**she's a racist/white feminist/privileged** Main evidence of her racism boil down to the fact she didn't have black people on Girls. I read nuanced explanations about why this is ""problematic"" but I liked Lena's reply. I also ended up reading on white feminism in general. I am kind of confused and a bit annoyed. If the whole point people are trying to make is that relatively privileged white women have different experiences than women of colour, well then wouldn't it be an issue if you suddenly took it upon yourself, as a privileged white woman, to talk about women of color? And look, I am sure any of the characters in girls could have easily been black because there are plenty of black people within those same circles, but wouldn't there then be a social commentary that she is completely ignoring the problematics of race and just using a black person for diversity? Anyhow, she could have included a black person, she could have made one character trans, and one latino and one could have been an Italian American , and one in wheelchair etc.. is it an actual FLAW if this didn't happen? Does she owe it to any of us to do it instead of to write about whatever she feels familiar with?

I also hate the accusation that she needs to check her privilege. Yes she is privileged. How much more should she acknowledge it, her humor constantly touches on this self-aware spoiledness and dependence on parents, her whole show starts with her hilarious breakdown when her parents decide to stop financing her. I can understand if this is alienating or even irritating to someone who had much harder life, and it is perfectly fair to not be into it, but a lot of us can relate and what is wrong with people who had different experiences to find or create their own platforms if this is too hard to relate to? What i would find outrageous would be if she either approached her privileged life without self awareness, trying to show her character as someone who struggles deeply, or even pretend she had a hard life when she didn't. Finally, to be a good writer takes TALENT, not just life experience. She happens to be very talented. I choose my media by how good the artist is, not which group they belong to.

**She defended a rapist** What I understood was that her friend and co-writer got accused by a girl, and she publicly stood by him. It's really difficult to judge. I can just say that while I believe victims need to be heard with respect (not blindly believed), my loyalty is first with people I am close to and love. There are certainly some men in my life that I know for a fact would never rape someone, and if they got accused I would do my best to stand by them rather than stay silent. This is not anti-feminist, this is about personal loyalty. Would you really not be devastated and betrayed if someone who knows you refuses to take your side in a horrible accusation because of the nature of the accusation and their political support for the cause?

**Her general online comments** so she does say many dumb things and then apologizes. I found her attitude about her dog appalling. I thought she was embarrassing when she went into detailed description of why OBJ ignored her - but I did not find it racist, just super self obsessed and something you should share with your friends who will then snap you out of it. Some of her ""edgy"" comments are a bit of racist humour, some are actually funny and overly nitpicked on, and others oblivious but nothing stroke me as hateful - comedians go to places and sometimes miss the mark. Her comment about wishing to have an abortion is something I actually perfectly understood in the context she was talking about, even if that conclusion was clumsy. It was connected to an issue I myself thought about a lot before, which is how often you say you support a choice but then still want to make it clear that you didn't abort (I remember being annoyed by some female politicians or celebrities for doing exactly that, and deciding even as a teenager that if I was ever in a position to be asked this, I'd refuse to say whether or not I had it because my public opinion is that abortion is always ok - and then I wondered if people would interpret that as defensiveness from someone who did have it, which would lead me to her final statement..)


**Conclusion:**

Lena Dunham is a talented and funny writer - this much is to an extent subjective and I understand that not everyone can relate to her. Criticisms of anyone's work are a good and interesting thing. Her whole theme is exposing herself, her observations (which can be a hit or miss), embarrassing memories, mundane memories, her body, even her ""ugliness"" in either physical or psychological aspect. She slightly reminds me of Woody Allen whom I also like. She strikes genius at her best and is embarrassing at her worst, but she needs to be able to be that in order to keep creating and improving.

What I resent in how she is treated is not that she is criticized, but that she is vilified as a human being by the people who are lately vilifying everything and that she is a good example about how much we are missing the point of art. Why does an artist always need to present themselves as an excellent person to be liked? Isn't it revealing and interesting that she exposes her weakness? Why should privileged people not talk about their experiences too? What do people actually want to see today from a creator? Why can't you criticize some acts without attaching the worst and most extreme labels to a person without any nuance?

**OVERAL CMV**: Explain to me why LD is such a horrible person that I should boycott her work and lose respect for her, or why encouraging her art is harmful in any way?



Tl;dr: Lena Dunham is talented and funny, and while she is currently accused of horrid things (being a racist child molester and rape apologist) I don't believe those main accusations have any substance. As such I want to keep following her art and stay interested in what she has to say. While i believe criticism is always good, I think character assassination and lack of nuance common in cancel culture really sucks and doesn't lead to better art. I am very open to discussing these points because I believe some of the things I am defending can be topics for themselves, that I might be wrong about and am happy to get into. In a way she is just a representation of something that happens to many people.",changemyview
CMV: There is no real reason step-siblings or adopted siblings shouldn’t date,7,j4bbrn,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j4bbrn/cmv_there_is_no_real_reason_stepsiblings_or/,31,2020-10-03 14:55:19,"I’ve never really understood this.

But I’ve never really heard a good argument for non-biological siblings. All I’ve really heard is “ew that’s just wrong” or “gross, is that like your fetish or something?”

The most valid argument I’ve heard is that you grow up with them so the relationship is different. But that doesn’t make much sense to me because I don’t understand what makes loving someone you already know so well wrong. Isn’t it essentially the same as dating a childhood friend? As long as there isn’t any manipulation, grooming, or abuse, there is no reason for it to be considered taboo other than people just thinking “it’s icky!” 

I’ve never been in a situation like this but the idea of telling two people that they can’t be together just because they grew up together feels kind of wrong to me. How is it my place to judge who they end up loving? Even if they just hookup with them once and then never speak of it again, it feels wrong to put that under so much more scrutiny than if they had just been childhood friends.",changemyview

"CMV: The way math education is currently structured is boring, ineffective, and stifles enjoyment of the subject. Math education should be reworked to be inquiry and problem based, not rote memorization",4767,j45bok,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j45bok/cmv_the_way_math_education_is_currently/,353,2020-10-03 07:27:33,"I have two main premises here

1. Modern math education at the elementary and high school level stifles everything enjoyable about math, and it does so to no end
2. An inquiry-based approach is at least equally effective, and possibly more effective. For this purpose, I'm using inquiry-based to mean that a significant portion of the learning is driven by students solving problems and exploring concepts before being instructed in those concepts.

Math, as it is taught in schools right now, barely resembles math. Everything is rote memorization, with no focus on creativity, exploration, pattern recognition, or asking insightful questions. Students are shown how to do a problem, and then repeat that problem a hundred times. You haven't learned anything there - you're repeating what someone else showed you.

So many students find school math incredibly boring, and I think it's because of this problem. Kids are naturally curious and *love* puzzles, and if you present them with something engaging and fun, they'll jump into it. A lot of the hatred of math comes from having to memorize one specific way to solve a problem. It's such a common phenomenon that there are memes about math teachers getting angry when you solve a problem with a different method.

There's the argument that ""oh we need to teach fundamentals"", but fundamentals don't take a decade to teach, and they should be integrated with puzzles and problem solving. Kids need to learn basic number sense, in the same way they need to learn the alphabet, but once they have that, they should be allowed to explore. Kids in english class aren't asked to memorize increasingly complex stories, and kids in math class shouldn't be asked to memorize increasingly complex formulae.

I'm currently a math major in university, and one of the first courses I took was titled ""Intro to algebra"". The second half of the course was number theory, but a great deal of the learning was from assignments. Assignment questions were almost always framed as ""do this computation. Do you notice a pattern? Can you prove it? Can you generalize it? Do you have any conjectures?""

There's no single right answer there, and that makes it interesting! You get to be creative, you get to explore, you get to have fun!! The questions were about a whole lot of number theory questions, and I know more number theory now than if someone had just sat at a blackboard and presented theorems and proofs. Everyone in that class learned by doing and exploring and conjecturing.

96% of people who reviewed the class enjoyed it ([https://uwflow.com/course/math145](https://uwflow.com/course/math145)).

Most students don't use the facts they learn in high school. They do, however, use the soft skills. There are millions of adults who can recite the quadratic formula, to absolutely no avail.  If these people instead learned general logical thinking and creative problem solving, it would be far better for them.

Progress in an inquiry based system is slower, but it helps you develop stronger mathematical maturity so you can pick up new concepts for other subjects - say calculus for engineering or physics - more quickly. Students develop more valuable soft skills, have way more fun, and get a better picture of what math is actually like. As such, I believe that inquiry based learning is superior. CMV!

CMV: American job benefits are becoming irrelevant and are no longer as important to consider when applying for jobs as a young professional.,5,j413zp,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j413zp/cmv_american_job_benefits_are_becoming_irrelevant/,27,2020-10-03 03:23:02,"I want to start off with saying I'm aware I haven't researched this enough, and that's why I'm reaching out to get several different opinions and see if anyone else feels similarly. I feel truly naive about the subject, but unfortunately I don't think I learned much from my college personal finance class.

Now that I'm in my mid-twenties, a number of Boomers in my life have suggested the importance of finding a job with good benefits. I, however, look for a job with a good reputation that will help me build a resume and continue learning skills for future positions and opportunities. Obviously, the ideal is a position that offers the best of both worlds, but it's just not that simple in my industry (restaurants/hospitality). Here are my thoughts.
Social Security: can we even rely on this anymore? Will it still exist when I finally have the opportunity to use it? I know it's required but it truly feels like a waste when you're living paycheck to paycheck. Perhaps not included in the category, but I think it's important to bring up.
Healthcare: Yeah, it's expensive on its own. I'd rather advocate for affordable healthcare. We end up paying exorbitant amounts anyway for terrible plans, so what's the point? I'm healthy, and my job depends on me being physically fit so will it really help me? Or will a medical emergency bankrupt me either way?

Life insurance: I don't have any worth at this point nor anyone I want to gain anything from my death. Maybe 10 years from now?

Vacation packages: Really unnecessary for me, if I can't make enough to afford a decent vacation anyway. Plus, I live to work and I would rather have a great job and no vacation than a decent job and a week or 2 a year off.

Retirement plans? Give me a break. If you gave me that money now I could actually use it and potentially have a decent life before I turn 60 or 65 or later. Maybe even invest it (through starting a business young, etc) and make more than what I'll earn from ""saving"". I can't imagine working for the next 40 years only to have enough money to do the things I've wanted but can't because I've developed health issues, or have sick relatives to care for, etc. Retirement seems like the biggest con out there and I've never seen it explained in a way that encourages me to pursue it. If I make enough money to save , it will go into a project to improve my life ASAP and to have available if life gets rough. Am I underestimating the value of the tax deductions?

Sick leave can be helpful, and crucial if you're prone to health issues. But the majority of what a healthy person needs should be covered in some way by the job already. But what am I missing here?

Plus, if we don't improve the healthcare and school systems, I won't be having kids. So that's an extra 250 grand+ I'll have at my disposal (not even going to go into how much college or competent childcare could cost in the future). There goes the value of maternity/paternity leave.

I know benefits were critical for the last generation, but my generation is buried under so much BS that it feels like just another way for people to get out of paying us fair wages. The fact that benefits are advertised as a way to measure how much a company cares for its employees is a joke at this point.

It all sounds stupid as I write it, but can someone tell me if I'm an idiot or if I'm seeing sense? Please don't explain like I'm an expert or like I'm 5, but at a level a typical young professional could understand.

In the overwhelming majority of cases, the job is actually much easier and less disgusting if done right away, so it seems to me that ""leaving it to soak"" is mostly just an excuse to try and stall, or better yet, to weasel out of washing dishes completely (shades of Homer Simpson).

CMV: Australian animals are not that scary,7,j3zkn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j3zkn2/cmv_australian_animals_are_not_that_scary/,33,2020-10-03 02:02:59,"So this is mostly aimed at people outside Australia that think Aussies escape death every day just by living their lives but Aussies please feel free to weigh in. 

Some Australian animals are scary. Crocodiles are scary, those things are basically dinosaurs. Salt water crocs specifically are the scariest mother fuckers that walk the earth imo. They're just huge, aggressive beasts, much more terrifying to me than American alligators or even Nile crocodiles by a long shot. 

Great white sharks. Also scary. We've all seen jaws. I know every shark movie is wildly inaccurate but if I saw a great white unexpectedly I would be scared. But they're not specific to Australia, they can be found all over and I don't think animals that only live in the ocean should be included in the Australian animals are so scary category.

Spiders and snakes. Here's where I really don't think Australian animals are any scarier than almost anywhere else. North and South America both have venomous snakes and spiders, so does Africa, Asia, I'm not sure what's going on in Europe on that front but my point is if you're reading this post there is a decent chance you live somewhere with poisonous spiders and snakes and manage to live your life without getting bit. Snake bites can be deadly but people living in Southwest America talk about Australia being dangerous as if they aren't knees deep in rattlesnakes. And maybe Australian snakes are more deadly overall but generally you can avoid snake bites by not being a dumbass.  

What else? Kangaroos? Emus? They *could* fuck you up but how often does that happen? Just don't bother them, they won't bother you. Would you rather fight a roo or a moose? Moose are gigantic, try to fight one, I dare you. 

Comparing Australia to North America they have crocodiles which are much scarier than gators. But all the other land animals compared to here are up against wolves, bears, moose, mountain lions, those big weird goats, buffalo. I think the snakes and spiders cancel each other out. So if you're comfortable living in bear country you should be perfectly fine in most of Australia. 

Really I think Africa has the scariest animals of everyone. Lions you guys. Hyenas. Gorillas. Omg.

This isn't a scientific study or anything other than ranking which animals are scariest by continent or country but I think I've made my point that Australian animals, over all, are not any scarier than anywhere else. Unless you live in like The UK where the biggest animal threat is maybe an earthworm.",changemyview
CMV: I think the Coinbase memo about keeping activism out of the workplace is good,51,j3zane,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j3zane/cmv_i_think_the_coinbase_memo_about_keeping/,96,2020-10-03 01:48:54,"For a bit of context, the CEO of Coinbase (a kind of blockchain/tech company) posted [this](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company-af882df8804) memo. For those who don't want to read it, it was basically saying that he doesn't want the company to be engaged in activism outside of Coinbase's core mission, and that he doesn't want employees to be at each others' throats over political disagreements. The main social issue/political disagreement that seems to have caused this is BLM.

This caused a bit of a stir, and a lot of people disagree with Coinbase's position.

I'm going to sort of collapse a lot of different peoples' responses into what I see as the main threads of the debate, as well as why I think they don't successfully rebut the memo. If you think that I'm misrepresenting one of the main thrusts of the argument, I'll try my best to dig up some of the responses that made me think that this is where people were coming from.

* Detractor take: Black Lives Matter is not political, it's just basic human decency, so publicly supporting BLM does not unduly politicize the workplace.

My response: I think while statements like ""black peoples' lives matter"" taken on its own is pretty anodyne and uncontroversial, but the exact same could be said about virtually any movement - ""blue (as in police officers) lives matter"", ""All lives matter"", ""pro-life"", ""pro-choice"" etc, are all fine statements on their own, but they're pretty obviously implying support for specific policies and such. I'm somewhat skeptical that the people who take this line of reasoning want companies to similarly support all lives matter, or blue lives matter, so it can't be the case that they mean that we should just be taking the literal meaning of the slogans at face value.

Since they almost certainly mean ""Black Lives Matter"" as in, the broader movement, I think that that quite obviously is a controversial political statement that I think reasonable people *can* disagree about. For one thing, there is no canonical Black Lives Matter platform - different chapters and foundations have different views. Some of them oppose charter schools, the chapter in Chicago gave looting positive connotations by describing them as ""reparations"". I don't think that supporting things like that is just basic human decency that pre-partisan companies support.

* Detractor take: Memos like this are easy for privileged white people to defend, but marginalized people don't agree with them.

My Response: I'm not really sure what to do with takes like this, I see them a lot in conversations with a social-justicey valence. For one, I'm not sure how they address the substance of the memo - unless you believe a very weird maxim like ""when white people and minorities disagree, the white person is wrong"" it doesn't really make sense as a counterargument. For two, it seems like in most of these discussions, it's mostly privileged people on both sides, it doesn't seem like there's some great mass of down-and-out black people demanding companies make statements about BLM, or do diversity trainings and such. I'll try and dig it up if people don't believe it, but I read somewhere that highly progressive people (who I suspect are the kind of people who are against the ideas in the memo) are in fact disproportionately white and wealthy - it just strikes me as being similar to the whole Latinx debacle where it's mostly just affluent whites and a smattering of careerist Hispanics pushing it, but the vast majority of actual Latinos don't care.

It seems like in my own career in tech, most of the political dustups - as well as the agreements that people make informally that echo the position taken by the memo aren't between minority progressives and privileged white reactionaries but between different immigrant groups (e.g. Pakistani and Indian coworkers sometimes getting into arguments about the conflict between their countries, but more often living by the tenets of the memo and being respectful of each other's views).

* By not taking sides, Coinbase is defending the status quo, which is itself political.

My response: I'm curious if the people who argue this line would say the same about other important issues - do companies who don't commemorate the Armenian genocide abet genocide deniers? What about zoning laws? It seems like people who are on this tack either think that there's something different about BLM, or that companies should be adopting a laundry list of positions about every issue, which I think would just be dumb and alienating to everybody. 

While you can, in a certain sense, argue that everything is political, I think that's mostly just playing semantic games - there's a pretty clear difference between doing things like voting or taking an explicit stand on issues, and say, eating a box of cereal. 

* This will prevent people from wanting to work at Coinbase

My response: I'd be interested to see data on this, again, this is just my anecdotal experience, but the company that I'm consulting for is going through a similar dustup, and it seems like there are plenty of people (including a bunch of minorities) who are skeptical if not outright hostile to the attempted social-justice-ification of the company. It seems just as plausible that more people will want to leave Coinbase if they do get too deep into activism. Further, I'm curious why most major companies try to stay out of activism, or just give very perfunctory statements if it's bad for business - I'm skeptical that some randos on twitter know better about how to run a profitable company than the people actually running big companies.

As an aside, I'm the least interested in this line - I mostly want to talk about what is good for society as a whole, not just for Coinbase.

----------------------

On a 30,000 foot view, that doesn't really respond directly to people, but I think gives a good impression of where I'm coming from: I think that liberal democracy depends on people being willing to amicably disagree - even about extremely important and personal issues. Like, if everyone acted as the detractors of the memo seem to suggest, it seems like every firm and community would be pulling up the drawbridges on dissent from their own views, and we'd have a very ghettoized society - ""Oh, don't go to that store, they have a bad take on the India-Pakistan conflict"" - ""Oh, don't work there, they don't require employees to be vegan"" etc. I don't think that would be good for anybody.

I'm a big believer in giving deltas for arguments that change my view in any way, so don't feel like you have to respond to everything I say.

TL;DR - I think it's in general good to maintain a pre-partisan professional atmosphere at work.

EDIT: The majority of top level responses so far have been working under the impression that the memo is banning employees from talking politics at work - I do not believe that that's what the memo is saying. If your response is along these lines, that's fine, but I think you need to first argue that that is in fact what the memo is trying to say.",changemyview

CMV: 60fps (frames per second) is only good for video games and YouTube Skits. It makes everything else look ugly.,4,j3wcg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j3wcg3/cmv_60fps_frames_per_second_is_only_good_for/,23,2020-10-02 23:15:11,"I’ve been thinking about this ever since I’ve seen Twitter mutuals upgrading anime and cartoon scenes to 60fps talking about how “Crisp” it is, when all it honestly did was make it uglier. They were basically the “Nintendo, hire this man” of animation. But I think I figured it out.

Consistent frame rate is good for video games because you are controlling what’s on screen. Since 60fps is easier to interpret having it along with precise and responsive controls allows for more fluidity and grants an illusion of more control over the image. Especially if the game is very fast and action packed.

While 60fps cutscenes aren’t necessary, it still looks good and helps blur the lines between story and gameplay to allow for more integration between the two. This enhances the video game’s narrative abilities.  It also gives the illusion of the game running at its highest form, since it looks smooth. Even if the game is particularly unfinished.

Naughty Dog’s 3 PS4 games (The Last Of Us 2, Ukcharted 4, Uncharted Lost Legacy), for example, are going to run at 60fps on the PS5, around the release of Uncharted 4 they explained that they had to decide on a constant 30fps or a constant 60fps early in development because they wanted to keep the lines between narrative cutscenes and gameplay to be blurred.

The only time a game looks better at a lower frame rate is if it’s a deliberate artist choice to evoke a certain feeling. For example most Arc System Works games (Guilty Gear, Dragon Ball Fighterz) have their character models cel shaded and they run at 12-15fps to evoke the feeling of a cartoon, anime, and classic fighting game sprite animation. Even then the games frame data, environments, and movement still operate at 60fps for better responsiveness.

For YouTube skits or vlogs, 60fps isn’t necessary but it’s welcome. A lot of CalebCity videos are at 60fps and it adds a bit of a realism filter in his skits which could make it funnier. I doubt the effect is intentional but it’s there.

It’s bad for animation because, since animation traditionally runs well below 30fps, 60fps emulators cause images to blur and look ugly. It hampers creative freedom in that regard too since you cannot squish images around like you normally would. I’m sure animation hand drawn to a pure 60fps would look okay but that would be an absurd amount of work that doesn’t seem necessary.

**Animated video games**, however, benefit. like Among Us, Shantae, Cuphead, and most Behemoth games (Battleblock Theater, Pit People, Castle Crashers, Alien Homonid). While the actual animations themselves don’t run at 60 for the reasons above, the camera, sliding (A character’s image will travel at 60fps while the running animation is at a standard 12-24), and other particle effects do. It’s a mixed bag but they can operate either way, since you are controlling the image. Similar to my point with Arc System Works.

For film and television 60fps makes it look a bit too realistic, which kills the fictional feeling of it. It may make it feel staged and ruin the experience unless it’s a deliberate choice by the producers to evoke that staged feeling, like most reality shows.

I’m not an idiot. I understand funding and coding issues are a problem for being able to run a game at 60fps or use a camera that can record at high frame rates. But in a perfect world where such things had no cost, all games ought run at 60fps. Nothing else, unless it’s real footage or meant to look like real footage.",changemyview
CMV: Wind is a terrible source of power,0,j3v5vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j3v5vv/cmv_wind_is_a_terrible_source_of_power/,146,2020-10-02 22:10:14,"Why are we even using wind? Compared to basically every other source, it is terrible. Here are some reasons.

For one, it is inefficient as HELL. If there is too little, no energy, and if too much wind, it fucking explodes. It needs that JUST RIGHT amount, and even then, it ain't worth going through all of that! And the places where they do put them? Are RIGHT on top of bird migration areas, which results in the deaths in millions of birds, hurting the environment, ironically.

For another, once again, EVERY other energy source is better. It's pretty bad when SOLAR of all things is a better source. When we *should* be focusing on building more hydroelectric dams, nuclear plants, and developing fossil fuels to be better, dumbass activists will whine about it being bad on the environment, when it is better.

Well, you might say, fossil fuels *are* bad on the environment, aren't they? And to that, I say yes. However, unfortunately, almost everything is about the results, and that is where wind fails. The main problem being, we can barely store it.

Now besides that, we have the turbines themselves. The king of irony here, is that it takes a great deal of fossil fuels to make, transport, and then set up, the turbines. Then after that, you realize, they are ugly as hell! A giant white dildo with with more white dildos spinning about. And they are placed right on countryside too, ruining the place!

When we have MUCH better alternatives, when they absolutely suck at providing, and when they are ugly, (at least, to me) then why. WHY do we still use them?

Maybe I am just not seeing the bigger picture. I dunno, cmv, reddit.

Edit: I researched somethings like the bird numbers more thoroughly, and they do, in fact kill quite a bit less than things like cats or towers.

Also, the part about it taking as much power it produces wasnt right either. I am not saying that they dont provide ANY power, but I am saying that in the grand scheme of things, that it isnt ideal to continue to keep making wind turbines, as better sources can be made.

That being said, I have not seen a response so far stating that wind is better then the others I mentioned, though solar wasnt as good as I initially thought.",changemyview

"CMV: Media literacy education, at least in the US, has resulted in worse media literacy.",15,j3jcnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j3jcnb/cmv_media_literacy_education_at_least_in_the_us/,7,2020-10-02 07:02:07,"Whenever the topic of ""fake news"" comes up the standard opinion is that we need more media literacy in education, and then people won't be susceptible to it. Well, we've had it. By now media literacy has been part of education for [several decades](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1046509.pdf) if not more. This is more than enough time for it to influence people's thinking, particularly if people learn these things during formative years. And I think there are two major problems with it: it is a major factor in distrust of the media, and it is so outdated it becomes just false.

Not all of it is bad. (This [Canadian guide](https://mediasmarts.ca/digital-media-literacy/general-information/digital-media-literacy-fundamentals/media-literacy-fundamentals) is one of the better I've seen.) But most programs, at least in the US, adhere pretty closely to [Common Sense Media's](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/news-and-media-literacy/what-is-media-literacy-and-why-is-it-important) list of questions, so those are the ones I'll focus on.

**It is a major contributing factor to distrust of the media.**

tl;dr: If kids are fed a steady diet of ""don't trust everything you read,"" it is very easy to go from there to ""the news is all fake.""

Let's go through the Common Sense questions one by one. They are all either not that useful, or actively harmful, in my view:

**""Who created this"":** Useless against fake news -- the ""writers"" are as fake as the news, and now that we have This Person Does Not Exist you can't even rely on throwing their photo into TinEye. It also tends to ascribe far more direct cause-and-effect influence to the individual writer, when editors and publishers often have as much or more say on how a piece comes out. Which leads to people cherry-picking people's old tweets or scouring their lives for bias -- which everyone has -- and using that to discredit them. 

**""Why did they make it/who is this message for"":** This is glorified ""recognizing types of writing"" ELA curriculum stuff, which is all well and good, but doesn't do much for media literacy. It oversimplifies media; a kid presented with a piece of sponcon would probably say it's a news post or a how-to and not an ad, and they wouldn't even be totally wrong. It also leaves out one big motivation: to lie, or deliberately misinform (which itself has sub-motivations: to deliberately misinform for political purposes, to deliberately misinform for pageviews and money, etc., to deliberately misinform for lulz, etc.). Which is the whole point of all this!

**""What techniques are being used to make this message credible or believable"":** The big one. As it is presented, and definitely as it is taught, it becomes a checklist: do you have statistics? Do you have quotes? Great! It's fetishizing of the techniques, or the things that look like facts, rather than actual facts. Statistics can be misleading or flat-out wrong. Quotes can be falsified or taken out of context. The question of who is a ""reputable source"" or ""subject expert"" is a whole other topic, but the short version is, plenty of unreliable outlets have a whole network of allies propping them up as reliable, and some outlets are selectively reliable. I kind of blame the SAT and the five-paragraph essay drills for this?

**""What details were left out, and why?""** The other big one. It is very easy to draw a line from ""Is the information balanced with different views -- or does it present only one side?"" to ""media must always present both sides, no matter the merit, or they are biased and wrong."" It also assumes details are always left out for a Reason, and not because the creator was on deadline, or they only had 100 words/30 seconds of ad space, or they had off-the-record info or info they couldn't get legal to sign off on, or they just forgot. (You could argue that it doesn't matter why they're left out. But ""why"" is right in the question.)

**""How did the message make you feel?""** This could be useful, but as taught, it isn't nuanced. What it \*should\* get at is that a piece of media that fits/doesn't fit your existing biases is not necessarily unreliable, and that a piece of media that stirs up your emotions can sometimes seem more reliable than it is. In practice, it leads to sources being dismissed because they're ""emotional"" or ""outraged,"" when it is 100% possible to have emotional truths and calm lies. Framing it as ""who might disagree with this?"" is also of limited importance -- it's easy for kids to be flippant and say ""people who are wrong,"" or to just not be exposed to or think of the communities that would.

There are also a couple of big media-literacy topics you almost never see in these courses: tech companies' influence over media, and particularly the role of newsfeed algorithms in what people are exposed to; link rot, paywalls, and the relative difficulty of finding older sources vs. new; the digital divide and how it affects what news you get; the financial difficulties of most media companies, and the effects of the companies, largely private equity, that keep them afloat; just so much.

**When applied to the Internet, media literacy programs are, and always will be, outdated.**

tl;dr: ok boomer

To illustrate: the University of South Carolina website actually still has this on its how-to-check-reliable-sources page: ""Another item to look for in the URL is the \~ (tilde) symbol.  This is often a sign that the page is a personal web page and as such, is likely not a credible research source."" If you remember when that was a thing, you are probably a boomer. Or at least Gen X.

In general, media literacy courses' view of the Internet is stuck in Yahoo directory days, and many teachers aren't much better informed. Most of them still teach the ""you can tell a site's reliability by its domain"" thing, when .com domains include the vast majority of the Web, including almost all news sites and the entirety of Google Scholar/Books, .gov domains are the views of the government, which are not necessarily unbiased, and .org domains came very, very close to being sold to private equity this year. This also obliterates the whole notion of primary sources; a blog post is not necessarily unreliable just for being a blog. (Would not pass: A blog post by a journalist, a respected historian, or any kind of subject matter expert. Would pass: A government press release falsely claiming that a news story is false)

I mean, there's just *so much.* ""Is the site filled with ads?"" is one I see a lot -- good luck finding a news site that passes that one! Another perennial is ""When was the page last updated?"", which is a relic of the times when websites would have that alongside the Geocities under construction GIFs. (Would not pass: Almost all books and research studies. Would pass: The Twitter updates from Herman Cain, who is dead.) 

But hey, they're not all that bad. Some guides have progressed all the way to 15 years ago, when liberals got their news from Daily Kos and conservatives got their news from Drudge Report! Even if you magically caught all media-literacy classes up to 2020, and that all teachers have the technical knowledge to teach it well. They're still going to be outdated in a matter of months. Media moves fast. A good example: At some point, probably soon, we're going to see the first deepfake video that is passed off as real and becomes an actual political factor. How does *anything* in any media literacy curriculum prepare kids to spot that? 

I'd like to be proven wrong on this, via research, success stories, whatever, because it's not like I have any better ideas. I'm also going into teaching, so it will probably come up in education classes/professional development if not in the classroom, and it'd be nice not to disagree with a big swath of that. But the whole thing just seems unsalvageable.",changemyview

Yes, the government can work on these issues, but it's easier to get it done when the majority of the population cares about them, at least in democratic countries. Environmentalists, progressists and other social activists have a harder time getting these poor people to vote for them, either because these people are really conservative and religious, or because these groups have very little charisma in comparison to the conservative populists. Yes, the people affected by environmental destruction, discrimination and other social problems can be affected by poverty too; but the majority isn't. If these people no longer have to worry about starvation/security/eviction, then these people fighting against these social problems can have at least a few more supporters and will have a slightly easier time with their goals.

&#x200B;

For instance, there is this transgender YouTuber who came out publicly at age 5 and while there is an abundance of content online talking about her identity as a trans woman, unless you did your research and utilize Internet detective skills, you would have no idea that she is also Jewish. In virtually all of the videos and podcasts you hear about being trans, again no issue with that, but only I think twice, you hear her talk about being Jewish and even then, her Jewish identity is mentioned briefly.

I am really intrigued by this trend of Jewish identity being de-emphasized from the community except from the Orthodox Jews. Of course the Orthodox folk would conform to tradition for their love of God and tradition. But that cohort of Jewish people seem to be the exception to the rule, not the rule. Most Jewish people in America or either Reform or secular. As someone who is not Jewish but appreciate the beauty of Jewish culture and Jewish life, it seems kinda sad that Jewish culture and identity is largely being ""tossed in the trash for being antiquated and obsolete"".",changemyview

As a professional who makes $25 and hour working remotely from Florida, it only serves to hurt me (and others in my position with jobs above minimum wage) for the minimum wage to go up. If the cost of living goes up in Florida, my out-of-state employer isn't going to raise my wage and I'll have less spending power.

Even worker in state making more than minimum would be impacted. I used to work hourly for a Fortune 500 who raised their minimum pay from $10.00/hr to $15.00/hr, and me who had 6 years of tenure and me who had performance based increases that brought my pay up to $17.50 was now making $2.50 more than new employees and basically my $5 of increases over the years meant nothing. Companies that are force to pay their lowest level employees more money aren't going to increase their labour cost any more to make up for the reduced spending power of the higher paid employees.

If the minimum wage increases, we're only going to hurry major retailers, restaurants and other businesses in implementing automation. There's a Walmart near me right now that literally has no traditional checkouts (all self-checkout) and restaurants are using more and more kiosks, apps orders, and other forms of automation (including AI or drivethru) instead of hiring front line employees.

* Evidence of eligibility for the office
* Evidence of being on enough ballots to have a mathematical chance of winning -- 270 electoral votes
* Evidence of public support, currently rather complicated based on various polls

The first two criteria are perfectly neutral and logical, based only on the legal possibility of a candidate winning. The criteria for electoral votes is set not at some arbitrary number, but at the legal mathematical possibility of the person being elected. If you don't meet these criteria, then it's useless to have you on stage because you legally cannot be president. 

The problem is the last one. It's subjective, which allows them to control who gets into the debates for political advantage. This basically is set to ensure nobody but a Democrat or Republican can be in the debates. They can and do change it at will, as they did after Ross Perot got into the debates. Being in the debates also has a good probability of advancing lesser-known candidates in the polls due to more exposure, so it becomes a self-fulfilling criteria that keeps lesser-known candidates off. 

We should stick with just the first two to eliminate the political bias in debate qualification. CMV

What won't change my mind is the fear of a filled stage. Only four candidates consistently have the necessary 270, and that's not too many. It's not likely to increase by more than maybe one (if we get another Ross Perot type).

The pocket veto is undemocratic in my opinion, and presidents should be forced to sign laws even if they morally object to them. The entire point of a 2/3 majority overruling an executive veto is to allow the Legislative branch to create new laws over the president's objection. So I feel it's time to empower the legislative branch at the cost of the executive branch, and strip the president of their ability to pocket veto, thereby forcing them to sign a bill into law no matter how much they object to it.

Or when we show that males have a natural tendency towards working in engineering while females prefer more social careers that suddenly becomes an issue and the researcher was sexist and generalizing and its due to social engineering.

The more that we refuse to accept races/genders have genetic differences (some negative, some positive) the quicker we can work towards fixing these issues, but if we keep on ignoring them and pretending everyone is the same then society will always have these issues but we just choose to ignore them.

 Bitching about the base price of a game is absolute lunacy. Let me take you back to 1996, a time before DLC's and lootboxes, and introduce you the N64. 1st tier games released for the N64 would cost you $59.99. Fast forward 24 YEARS and the price for a 1st tier game is $59.99. While virtually everything around us has inflated in price, video games have remained the steady constant despite numerous upgrades in graphics, quality content, and performance...yet people still complain. We are getting a better product today at yesterday's price. I'm convinced those that complain don't have the slightest idea of the amount of effort and man-hours required to make a quality game, $60, especially today, is a steal.

As for lootboxes, micro transactions, slot machines, etc. sometimes the simplest answer is the best one. If you don't want to spend the money or you are in a position where you are unable to spend the money, boy do I have a solution for you...don't spend the money. I will note, however, that giving players who purchase in game content an advantage is pure, unadulterated bullshit and I vehemently disagree with it. 

Consider micro transactions a nonmandatory donation to the developers who continue to put out quality content at a concrete price.  It's as if we're expecting the highest quality content at the lowest possible price. Please show me where that mentality has ultimately benefited the consumer in the long run.

Let me explain. If you believe it’s possible to be born into the wrong body (i.e female genitalia yet you identify as male), why isn’t it possible to be born with the wrong skin color instead of genitals? Gender roles are entirely social constructs but so is race. Skin color is usually the only physical difference but that’s only important because we make it so. It’s no different from any other genetic difference like hair color or height. The real differences are cultural, which is, by definition, completely made up by people just like the idea of gender identity. 

Many people will bring up the point of “racial experience,” i.e a white person who wants to identity as black never had to go through the black experience and all that entails. That’s certainly true, but what about people of color who pass as white? Few would argue that white-passing mixed-race people are white. If your reasoning behind why that is is because they were raised in their non-white culture, what about, for example, a white baby adopted and
raised by black parents? They too grew up
immersed in black culture and familiar with black experience, so what’s the real difference?

I live here again now (for about a year) and remember why I left the first time. Thinking of moving again. My reasons are as follows:

1. Drivers. Everyone complains about the the traffic, but it isn't actually the congestion or the number of cars, it is the ""hurry up,"" shit driving skills. Texan friends blame a recent influx of Californians, but the drivers sucked back in 04' too.  Big, huge, unnecessary (for the none laborers) trucks being driven like shit by idiots or smaller cars driven by those whose only thought is: ""me."" Teaching my wife to drive for the first time when she got here has been a nightmare. She is either run over or she learns bad habits to keep from being run over.

2. Everything is bland looking. Yes, I know the winters are mild, but the lack of 4 distinct seasons has me longing for color.  I know the ""hill country"" can be pretty, but overall the city is a big swath of beige and driving through the few pretty parts is ruined because of shit drivers (see above). Oh...and as a perk, you get 4 months out of the year that are worthless unless you have a boat or a pool or don't like breathing while you run.

3. Tech overload. I work in Tech. Jobs are good. I'm glad they are down here and I owe them my gratitude for employment. I get it. Yet, the constant bombardment of $500 words I hear out of the mouths of people because they are  feel overly important makes me want to take a fat shit. Ideally in their mouths.  It is starting to feel like the boys in Silicon Valley down here and all the doucheness that entails. Bring on the Elon fans to shout me down. 

4. Keep Austin Weird. This sentiment is still there, but has mostly lost out to the influx of people. What you get is a ""rally"" almost daily at the capital building of the craziest liberals, only to be shouted down by the good ol' boy Texan traditionalist. The middle ground would be the tech douches that I am a part of and disdain.  The Keep Austin Weird vibe kept this city from developing legitimate mass transit when it was proposed and they had time (point #1) Now all I see are 2-3 tiny trains that are mostly empty that tax dollars were blown on. 

5. Price to value. This isn't Aspen, NYC, Bern, or Tokyo prices,  but it is still over priced for what you get (see points 1-4). My goal is to buy more houses and become a landlord eventually because this place is headed for serfdom in the future. I know what side I want to be on when that happens.

6. The music scene. There was a time, I suppose, when Austin was a hip place for this.  No longer. SXSW is a shit show now. Very little to do with music and more of a place where people can get priced out to see a shit show of drunks, crowds, and ""DJs."" Like how comicon was cool back in the day I guess. Or how the people her now talk about how great it was in the early 2000's. Or how in the early 2000's people talked about how great the 90's here were. I think it is just Nostalgic thinking. It pry always sucked. Going downtown to see some band is not worth it. FULL STOP. SRV sucks too. I like the blues. I play guitar too. I do like music though, not guitar licks with backing that he spews out. Yes, he is a great guitar player, but he's been dead for years.  He doesn't need to be on the radio all.the.time. Sacrilegious, I know.

7. ** This last point may be unfair. I have been back for about a year from living in places that were truly open 24/7 with good mass transit and places you could walk to. So coming here again I find it lacking in things to do that don't cost money or cost you your liver. I am a homebody.

I'm annoyed just typing this and can't be bothered to list other reasons.  Maybe I'll start packing tomorrow?

Change my mind.

CMV: Puerto Rico should not become a state,11,j31fly,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j31fly/cmv_puerto_rico_should_not_become_a_state/,39,2020-10-01 12:02:18,"Puerto Rico should become independent, not a state.

Why not? First, I have nothing against Puerto Ricans at all. However, I don't think it's a good idea to admit the *territory of*, the *island of* Puerto Rico - the land itself, along with its residents - as a new state. Instead, in my view, the island and the US should establish a timetable leading to full independence and agree upon a treaty outlining the close relationship thereafter.

Now, if events unfold differently and PR residents genuinely choose statehood and Congress/the President admits it, I will welcome them with open arms and celebrate the day. I do, however, imagine that island residents a generation or two hence will regret the outcome.

* **Island residents are yet to support statehood.** All the status referenda to date either showed greater preference for the current commonwealth/unincorporated territory status, or more recently polls flawed one way or another. That may change in November when a binary choice, state-or-not poll like those used by Alaska and Hawaii is on the ballot. (The better poll of sentiment would be ranked choice including the status quo commonwealth, statehood, or independence.)

* **Mainlander interests drive mainland appeal.** There appears to be a disconnect between reasons mainlanders might want PR statehood and reasons islanders might want it. In short, the bargain appears to be massive federal benefits accompanying statehood in exchange for two additional Democratic senators and ~5 additional Democratic representatives from the island... which the Republicans will oppose, fearing the same. In other words, national political considerations are driving statehood interest stateside, considerations for PR welfare entirely secondary.

* **Statehood does nothing to address Puerto Rico's essential challenges.** The state of PR would still have to deal with the Jones Act; PR would be exactly as distant as it is now; and US standards, wage laws, taxation, etc. would only reinforce PR as a relatively expensive Caribbean business location. 

* **Expansion of the United States is a bad geopolitical move.** While statehood for Puerto Rico would relieve colonizer accusations, absorbing the island as a state will provide cover for less savory actors to move: China on Taiwan, Turkey on Northern Cyprus, Russia on Belarus, Russia on Donbass, Israel on the West Bank, etc. We only invite comparison as to why it's OK for Puerto Rico to vote to join the US but not OK for Crimea to vote to join the Russian Federation. Admitting PR in these times is to invite widespread, unforeseen, deep consequences and costs.

* **An independent Puerto Rico would retain most/all status quo benefits while reaping additional advantages.** The US has facilitated independence for the Philippines, the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Micronesia and Belau; statehood like Hawaii is not the only possible outcome. Island security and defense would remain in the US' interest. The island could continue to use the US dollar (or de-dollarize if that were more advantageous.) A durable, dual-citizenship structure with freedom of movement is not unrealistic. Meanwhile, independent Puerto Rico would no longer be subject to the Jones Act that raises shipping costs, and could set its own wage and tax levels more competitively with its Caribbean competitors.

* **Statehood is forever.** If Puerto Rico is incorporated as a state, there's no going back. There's no more Puerto Rican team at the Olympics. There's likely greater inflow from the mainland with retirees, property developers, etc. watering down the island's character. The value of Congressional representation may fade as the *nation* of Puerto Rico is dissolved in the broader US, like Native Americans, Acadiens and Hawaiians before them. The next generation, and beyond, will mostly regret what was lost and how little was actually gained by statehood.

CMV: Tangled is a superior movie compared to Frozen,339,j30kat,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j30kat/cmv_tangled_is_a_superior_movie_compared_to_frozen/,35,2020-10-01 11:01:48,"Def, ""superior"": in terms of characterization, plot, soundtrack, etc

Disclaimer: I have watched Frozen three times and a half and Tangled only twice so I know Frozen better than Tangled. Also copy paste links failed, I'm too lazy to relink lol

1) Villain

Why start from villain? Well, it's the number one flaw that I dislikes from Frozen. Hans just appears once, with a love song, and then randomly reveals that he never loved Anna, with like, zero hints. The fact that he was a good Samaritan with delivering blankets and trapped Elsa instead of downright killing her with excuse of self-defense goes to prove how absurd his villainy is. Mother Gothel is a far, far superior character, even though the audience knows she is the villain, she cleverly shuts the daughter in the tower and uses lies to scare Rapunzel into staying. The fact that she sings ""mother knows best"" highlights her ruthless and cunning nature much better than Hans' random planning that seemed to come from nowhere and relied on being the very first person to interact with the princess who had never met another man.Like, that is such, such chance based planning. Gothel took far less chances with her hard-to-find remote tower and her warnings against Rapunzel, even tracking her town and tricking her to thinking Flynn had stole the crown and left her for good. That's right, she knew Flynn well enough to think ahead and prepare the trap, especially since Flynn was usually a cautious and careful man. 

2) Side characters

It's apparent to me that the side characters are much more charming than Frozen. Olaf was innocent and a fine comedy play, but other than his musical number I felt like he didn't contribute much. Flynn's good old horse rival was actually key to solving the problem (the evidence is only at the beginning of the video, but it's clear Flynn is riding the horse), as it had a much clearer personality, snooping around to find his scent, actually having a slightly annoyed personality. Not to mention fighting with a sword, trying to ""talk"" to Rapunzel, so on and so forth. But he realized that Flynn was set up in the end and helped him out. Rapunzel's charming chameleon is equally important. The way it teases Flynn when things go awry or how it seems more than just a pet, a helper to Rapunzel to give signals when needed makes it feel more convincing than Olaf. The scene at 1:50 here where the chameleon knowingly motions towards his hand is the cherry on top of the cake when Flynn is surprised by Rapunzel's magical powers, and all the other scenes work together to show his sass and humanization. Svenn is comparable to Maximus as animals, but other than ""reindeer are better than people"", it didn't really feel like Svenn had a pivotal role or moment within the movie. Not to mention the tragic sense of Frozen's death was quickly washed away by ""Do You Wanna Build a Snowman"", while Tangled lingered on the power of the daughter's lost and disappearance, especially with this touching scene between king and queen. There is basically no moment like that in Frozen. Frozen tries too hard to put so many gags and songs that it doesn't have time for the silence. That's why Tangled is better than Frozen.

3) The songs

Let's face it, Frozen only has the two main memorable songs, Snowman which shows off the childlike nature of the two kids, growing into loneliness, and Let it Go, which shows off Elsa's freedom and independence. However, the former reveals a crucial plot hole that makes you think twice, as a simple conversation could've solved all the problem. Tell her you have ice problems man! But no, Elsa was too scared, and the trolls were not helpful at all. Instead of helping solve the actual problem with the ice powers being used for good (as seen in the end of the film), the parents interpreted it as to keep her isolated and help make her more... depressed and bad at situations. Which is exactly how Anna got into her Hans problem, yada yada. The absurdity of the characters' actions destroy the contradictory ideas presented in Snowman.

Now, Let it Go is a powerful song, I will not deny that, it has excellent animation. However, I argue that Tangled songs combined are far better than just this one power moment. As mentioned, Mother Knows Best is fantastic characterization, and I've Got a Dream is much more memorable than Olaf's song, as Rapunzel managed to sway over an entire bar of rowdy men by appealing to their hopes and dreams. Finally, At Last I See the Light is incredibly touching with visuals that give Let it Go a run for its money. The touching intimacy of the two and the warmness of colors both combine together to stress Flynn's character development and add together for a much better arc than... whatever happened to Anna and Elsa over the course of Frozen. The fact that Olaf's song is hugely for comedic effect (and the blissful emptiness bringing nothing to the table) greatly helps my 2nd argument.

4) Main characters

Over the entire course of the movie, it felt like unfortunately Kristoff barely had any development. He did sing to his reindeer, and had some comedic parts, but... it felt mostly on Anna and Elsa's adventures. Anna felt... kind of empty to be honest. Did she really have any other moment than her child song (Snowman) that displayed her energy? Sure, she had innocence enough to fall for a villain, but she didn't seem... unique. In Tangled, Rapunzel had many adventurous moments with swinging with her hair, fighting with a frying pan, and her unique hair gimmick (flower bloom and grow). I think she's very comparable to Anna because both were shut in, lonely, and wanted to have activities. But while Rapunzel broke out of her shell and used her joy (remember I had a Dream? yeah.) to spread happiness and showed off her adventurous side, Anna just went along with the ride. She just decided to keep going after her sister, which barely shows any development. I mean, she's been doing that since childhood. And in the end she sacrifices herself, which is... not that big of a surprise, to be honest. Her character was kind of built up for that. Anna was too predictable. And Elsa as well. She just kept trying to establish that she could survive on her own and didn't need anyone else. It was only when the final sacrifice occurred very late into the movie that she changed her mind. But compared to the other protagonist, Flynn Ryder, her development was too sudden. Flynn gradually had fun with Anna and the aforementioned See the Light is the definitive turning point that we convincingly see Flynn fall for Rapunzel. And though he retained his sneaky nature, he began to value love more, making the main two protagonists far more convincing characters than Anna and Elsa.

Conclusion: Mother Gothel is far more convincing and creates a tense situation for the entire movie, establishing a strong mood and a good villain, while Hans was a surprise factor and could only dominate the scene up to his defeat, which was short. The side characters are not as good, as Svenn was hardly developed as well as Maximus and even a chameleon had more characterization than Olaf the snowman. While Let it Go is a fantastic piece of work, ""Do You Wanna Build a Snowman"" along with ""In Summer"" are self contradictory and brings up questions about the plot. In contrast, every single song from Tangled develops the characters or shows something important. Even the main characters are more shallow in Frozen than in Tangled. As such, my definitive conclusion is that Tangled is a better movie than Frozen.",changemyview
CMV: Ultra-nitpicky and precise genre classifications are useful,17,j300qe,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j300qe/cmv_ultranitpicky_and_precise_genre/,65,2020-10-01 10:26:17,"To start with, I'm not even sure how many people actually strongly disagree with my view. But I've definitely seen strong opposition in at least contexts, so I think maybe this is still worth putting out there and seeing if my thinking about this is off. Note also that while I'm going to be primarily talking about music, because that's the context where I see this come up most often, I think that everything I'm going to say generalizes to other types of art too.

The usefulness of genres rests in them grouping together similar families of work, thus making it easy to find things you might like based on other things you like. To use metal as an example, there is a metal sub-genre called doom metal, and this sub-genre is furthered divided into sub-sub-genres like traditional doom, epic doom, funeral droom, drone doom, etc. To someone who doesn't really care about doom metal, this might seem superfluous - surely just calling it ""doom metal,"" or even just ""metal,"" suffices, right? But for someone who is really into one of these sub-genres, the differences matter, because I want to find bands that have the qualities of my favorite sub-genre and not primarily of another one. If I ask for recommendations for traditional doom bands and someone responds with Sunn O))), they're not really giving me close to what I'm asking for.

Anyway, that's the argument. I understand that counter-arguments tend to be to the effect of this all gets too nitpicky, and who cares what genre something is if you like it, or even that just classifications can be elitist, but none of these arguments so far have convinced me. That said, maybe I'm just seeing bad arguments, and there actually are plenty of good ones.",changemyview

You get this stuff thorough out most of history with states gaining a monopoly on violence and than horrendously misusing it. Obviously a well armed populace who consider the use of violence acceptable isn’t going to make that much of a difference if the vast majority of the population is behind it, but it could at least prevent weird stuff like what’s been happening in American cities with crowds of people getting gassed for little to no reason and police just getting away with it, as well as maintaining the possibility that persecuted minorities would just pull an IRA and make sure there persecutors have a harder time oppressing them.

The claim about the spirit of the amendment may be true BUT given the advanced weapons technologies of today, the vast majority of which are only accessible to the military, US civilians are still at the mercy of whoever controls the military even if we can all buy AR-15s, bump stocks, and drum magazines.

"CMV: If you are voting for Biden just because you disagree with Trump or think that he is the only chance to get Trump out, you are part of the political problem in our country right now and are just too lazy to really look into 3rd parties.",0,j2zrem,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j2zrem/cmv_if_you_are_voting_for_biden_just_because_you/,15,2020-10-01 10:09:14,"First off, my inbox has blown up from a recent post, so sorry if I don't respond that quickly.

&#x200B;

Here's some backstory:

Basically, coming up to this election, I've never been a fan of Trump. I think his policies on bringing jobs back to the U.S. is good, but that is perhaps one of the few things I see eye to eye with him on, but he is disrespectful (as we've undoubtedly seen in the first debate), and he is just bad spirited and unpresidential, overall. However, I have not been the greatest fan of Biden either. I think he is a terrible public speaker, has been a terrible racist politician also, and I don't think he stands for the best policies either (determining what hate speech is and unprotecting it under the 1st amendment, increasing stricter drug laws, interfering with foreign elections, Ukrainian-Russian militarist intervention, etc).

&#x200B;

My disappointment and my feeling of alienation in both parties has sent me to look into 3rd parties recently, and I found I agreed heavily with Howie Hawkins and the Green Party. I also looked into Jo Jorgensen's campaign, but I didn't fit in there too well either.

&#x200B;

Now that that is out of the way, I am looking to see what other's arguments are on this: 

Nearly everyone I have talked to who are going to vote for Biden are doing so because they disagree with Trump and say that they really don't agree with a lot of Biden's policies, but they believe he is the only one who can get Trump out.

&#x200B;

I believe this is one of the most false and, quite frankly, idiotic statements I have ever heard. If you look up the statistics for the presidential election in 2016, only around 55% of all eligible voters actually voted. That was roughly 26% of the popular vote for Trump and the other 26% for Hillary. That leaves 45% of the U.S. population of registered eligble voters who didn't vote for anyone in that election.

&#x200B;

If that 45% of voters who didn't vote looked into or voted for a 3rd party candidate, they would've beat both the Democrats and Republics by a landslide! And I believe it would be the same deal this year. I don't think we are going to see a big voter turnout, once again. But what drives me NUTS is the people who say a 3rd party candidate won't win and that Biden is the only one who can beat Trump, but they will never vote or even look into the 3rd party candidates anyways. Everyone who thinks that Biden is the only one who can defeat Trump is being brain fed exactly what the Democratic party wants you to think, and also think about how many other people are saying that exact same thing. If all the people who felt that Biden wasn't a great option but was the only one who could vote trump actually did LOOK INTO the 3rd parties and even VOTED for a 3rd party that maybe they would agree more with than Biden, that candidate would have the same chance to win as any other candidate everyone is handing their vote to.

&#x200B;

I also want to just state that I also think it is a terrible fact that the other candidates that are present on the ballots are not invited or given the chance to debate with the 2 corporate parties at these presidential debates, and it is ridiculous that they are getting kicked off ballots they already solidified for, by both the Democrats and the Republicans (check out Howie Hawkin's case in Wisconsin or Pennsylvania if you are confused about that one). I do think our whole voting process of a whole does need to change, but it does not change the fact that near half of Americans rather not vote or even vote for someone they don't fully support, rather than actually look into the 3rd party candidates and give them a chance.",changemyview
CMV: The reason there are still so many trump supporters is because of the media.,13,j2yyyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j2yyyn/cmv_the_reason_there_are_still_so_many_trump/,99,2020-10-01 09:17:28,"First off, you have to admit that during Trump's 2016 presidency, there was a lot of ""fake news"" or things that were taken out of context. This happened with various (usually) credible news sources which actually benefited the Trump campaign. Even if there was more true news than false, I think everyone can admit that there was still too many instances of lying and putting words out of context. If you think everything they were saying was true, you can simply watch the full clips of his press conferences in 2015 that were taken out of context and various videos of people debunking what news stations were saying. 

This created a ""the boy who cries wolf"" effect which every time valid points were brought up, they were usually dismissed because how much credibility they have lost. The media could've made Trump lose many supporters if they just reported cold, hard facts instead of opinions and words taken out of context. This is why many Trump supporters don't believe anything bad about Trump when these news stations cover it.

Secondly, the saying is ""negative exposure is still exposure"". They reported on Trump every day and when people would actually get convinced to look into it, they look into Trump and may see some lies being told. This causes people to actually agree with some points the guy is making in which turns them into supporters. If you truly didn't want Trump to become president, you should've ignored him all together in the logic of ""he's not important enough to cover"" like other candidates. 

Thirdly, and honestly it's because of BLM. Joe Biden hasn't yet denounced the riots but Trump has. So it becomes a instance for many people of ""If you support everything about BLM, vote Biden. If you don't support 3% of BLM, vote Trump"" which News stations enforced because of headlines like ""Mostly peaceful protest..."" which is idiotic. 

News like Washington Post, CNN, New York Times, Chicago Tribune, Buzzfeed, Vox, etc. are the exact reason why Trump still has so many supporters. They're trying to hurt Trump while actually helping him out whenever he ACTUALLY says or does something fucked up.",changemyview

6. There are 4, 15 minute quarters and between quarters the panel gets a chance to review their notes/scorecards and make a total for each candidate. This way, they get to see the score at the end of each quarter and decide if they need to be more aggressive or if they need to pull back on the lies, etc.

I see the term “white passing” being used a lot to describe people that are biracial, asian, latino, middle eastern, etc.  that appear to be of European ancestry. I understand what the term is trying to accomplish but I feel like it misses the mark. 

Race is a social construct  (which is probably why conversations like this become really convoluted and confusing) and is used to distinguish people based of off physical attributes (skin color, facial features, hair). That is at least as I understand it. A latino person with darker skin and features that is CLEARLY of Latin American ancestry and a latino person that would be described as “white passing” (light skin, light hair, northern/western European features) do *not* face the same racism. They may face xenophobia (if they reveal their national origin) but their appearance grants them the same white privilege as any white person. For a white latino to identify as a “POC” is weird to me because 1. They aren’t “of color” and 2. They don’t face the *same* discrimination as other Latinos. They aren’t “white passing” they are just white. That is their race, and it doesn’t erase their heritage, it just is what it is. 

I know white and European are used interchangeably but they aren’t (or shouldn’t be) the same thing. I feel like “European passing” may be a more accurate term but I don’t even know why that would be necessary when discussing racism.

I may agree with “all heroes don’t wear capes” but first responders and anyone that is working a job to save or help people should never be labeled “hero”. The exception is if they do something outside of “working hours”. Heroes should only be named individually where they have gone out of their way to help or save someone. Treating people as heroes when they are only doing their job seems to make a divide between them and anyone who is getting paid to do the same thing. It also makes us think that they need to only do good things instead of realizing they are following their rules of their workplace.

Edit: So volunteer first responders someone who is going out of their way saving or helping someone without known reimbursement (being paid). I would consider heroic.

Edit2 : I would not consider military people heroes because I believe killing is not a heroic thing. It may be a necessity but it will never be heroic.",changemyview

Trump was calm, rational and presented a compelling argument. That elections have consequences.  That he was elected for 4 years not 3. That it is different from 2016 in that the Senate and the President are from the same party now. Also that if given the chance the democrats would do the exact same thing the republicans are doing. Biden in response rambled a bit about not moving a SC nominee forward while people are voting without giving a good reason why that matters. He then shifted the topic and discussed issues where he disagrees with Barrett, but that was not the question asked. 

Here’s a clip if you’d like to (re)watch. [link](https://youtu.be/fo5xby25HH8)

To change my view, please convince me Biden did a good job answering this question or that Trump did a poor job. Don’t bring up the rest of the debate. That’s not germane to this CMV.

"CMV: People who call white people racist for using n*gger in a non-offensive way while using it regularly themselves, are racist themselves",0,j2t7bv,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j2t7bv/cmv_people_who_call_white_people_racist_for_using/,41,2020-10-01 03:44:11,"Let me say one thing first. I don't think it's okay for someone to use the word n*gger in an insulting or oppressive way. But I find it kinda odd that a lot of people, mostly white, are accused of being racist just because the used the word n*gger in a non-aggressive way, like singing/rapping along with a song or talking about a historical topic or so. I think it's more about the context than about the word itself. Therefore I find it strange that it's socially accepted for a (white) person to use the 'n-word' but not the word 'n*gger'. Even though it's the same word, with the same meaning. It's nothing but a way of avoiding the word. 

Now don't get me wrong, I'm not pleading for the famous n-word pass. But my biggest issue comes from these people who use it all the time but wouldn't tolerate it from a white person if they used it (once again, in a non-aggressive way). Calling them a racist, while in fact, they are the one who differentiates based on skin color. So if people were consistent about it then I would totally get it. But these double standards are fucked up in my opinion. How can someone get angry about something they do themselves and keep intact?",changemyview
CMV: Employers who pay minimum wage cannot expect more than minimum effort,38,j2sobx,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j2sobx/cmv_employers_who_pay_minimum_wage_cannot_expect/,84,2020-10-01 03:15:59,"If you pay minimum wage, then the best you should expect from your employees is minimum effort. I saw one manager complaining about how hard it is to ""find an employee who smiles, shows up on time, isn't on their phone during their shift, etc."". When I applied for a grocery store job that paid $8.85 an hour, they required an open schedule and mandatory weekends. When I asked about pay and providing PPEs, the manager said to me ""well it sounds like you aren't very interested in this job"". 

So if you pay minimum wage as an employer, you get minimum effort. If certain employees want to go the extra mile, that's fine, but don't expect me to. You CAN'T expect me to, because you have shown that you are putting in minimum effort on your end. If I see somebody stealing from the store, then I will not stop them and allow them to leave without paying, even if it makes you as a manager look grossly incompetent and threatens your job with the district manager. I also think it's funny how managers struggle to get people to come on in their day off to fill no-shows. Gee, I wonder why they aren't showing up. Could it be you aren't paying well and not providing benefits? I laugh at those managers as they struggle and drown in the stress of falling behind. Stress that is no doubt toxic to their health and well-being. 

If you as an employer, especially large scale companies, pay minimum wage, you get minimum effort and nothing more. Even if this minimum effort makes you look grossly incompetent and threatens your job security.

I would also like to note the whole ""small businesses can't afford it"". I have no issue with paying people minimum wage, you just can't expect them to go the extra mile on your behalf, even if makes you look incompetent as a manager.",changemyview
CMV: Bring back the colosseum (sort of),0,j2seo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j2seo6/cmv_bring_back_the_colosseum_sort_of/,27,2020-10-01 03:02:03,"We should bring back the colosseum. Not for all purposes, such as animal fights or mass slaughter of slaves, and certainly not for paid fighters. It should be brought back for 2 consenting adults to fight to the death without legal consequences. 
Challenges would be issues via a government website, which would keep a public record of all challenges issues issued and the results. The challenges can end in: 

The challenged person declining (a default victory for the challenger)

One person pulling out of the challenge after accepting (a default victory for the other person)

A mutual cancellation (both people agree to pull out, nobody wins)

A victory (the duel happens and one person is killed, leaving one victor)

So why would this be a positive thing? For a start, it may reduce murder rates. Between 2018 and 2019, [51% of murders came as the result of a quarrel, dispute, revenge attack or loss of temper](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/homicideinenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2019#what-do-we-know-about-the-circumstances-and-location-of-homicides). Although some temper-related incidents would still occur, revenge attacks and disputes could be settled by angrily challenging one’s enemy to a duel as opposed to driving to their house with a shotgun. This would be the more attractive option for any premeditated killing, as it exempts the killer from legal consequences. The overall benefit of this is that it allows time for both parties to cool off before any violence occurs, giving them a chance to change their minds and mutually pull out (or for one person to pull out, making the other person the publicly declared winner of the dispute). This is similar to the tradition of “pistols at dawn”, [which was supposed to allow duelists to have time to sober up and reconsider their actions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel). The remainder (in which someone dies) will reduce the number of murders that the police have to investigate. This allows more man hours for investigating murders, which would increase the rate at which murderers are caught when they kill outside of the colosseum. All in all, killings would be less likely to happen and murderers would be more likely to be caught. The people who would still be killed (the uncanceled challenges) would be consenting adults who agreed to endanger their own lives. And if two people, after having time too cool off, still both want to duel each other to the death then imo one of them would probably have killed the other had the colosseum not existed anyway. 

Could the arena be used by a complete psycho who wants to challenge everyone who looks at them wrong? Yes, but remember that you can decline any challenge you want. In a beef/dispute/quarrel, declining means that the other person has defeated you by default. If youre challenged by a guy that has challenged 20 people in as many weeks then youre just a sensible human being, no shame.

Could the arena become a a glorification of violence and encourage duelling for fun? The closest current comparison to this would be playing video games. Do they involve spectating glorified acts of violence? Yes. Is there any evidence that playing violent video games causes people to become killers? No. Plus, of course, nobody under 18 years old would be allowed to spectate in the arena.

Edit: 

Could this be turned into a profit engine by charging people to spectate? This would be a risk, and the best way to prevent it would be not to charge people to spectate. Possibly the “colosseum” concept could be shrunk to more of an outdoor combat arena, which costs less to maintain and therefore would not need to generate revenue to be easily maintained. With the money being saved on policing it would be easy to step up murder investigations as well as fund a small outdoor 2-man arena.",changemyview

Abortions aren't about being a parent or not,0,jfo2vu,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/jfo2vu/abortions_arent_about_being_a_parent_or_not/,9,2020-10-22 07:18:32,"There are so many posts on Reddit about how unfair it is that only the woman gets to decide whether she wants to be a parent, while the man just has to go with it.

However, the main reason why abortion is only the woman's choice is because her body is the one making the baby out of a single 1/2 cell that's from the man. The rest of the resources and labour come from her body.

That is the main reason. As a side effect, she gets one more way to opt out of parenthood, compared to men who only get 2 - to explain: first time is when having sex (assuming it is sex and not rape), during which both parties get to equally choose options for pregnancy prevention. The 2nd time is when the child is born after which both parties again equally get to decide to keep the child or give it up for adoption/decline parental roles - obviously if not both sign off on adoption one will have to pay the other.

In the older Crash games, I would die a few times and then think to myself “Oh, I know what to do now”. With this game, I had over sixty deaths in one level. The one pro to this game is that “modern mode” exists, but that doesn’t enhance the fun to me. In my opinion, seeing “💀60” on my screen doesn’t make me feel like I’m having a good time. It makes me feel like I’m wasting it. The gameplay doesn’t feel correct, either. The “enhanced shadows” were rarely of assistance to me. On top of this, the “bonus” stages are puzzles that require an absurd amount of skill to complete. In the old games, I used to love those levels, because they were fairly simple and very rewarding. In this game, I skip them. I appreciate the innovation of adding the masks, the N. Verted mode, the skins and the new playable characters, and though. I’m not saying that the game is not high quality. I think the graphics, audio, level design and story are great. But to me, this game is not fun.

Metallica is overrated and is NOT the best metal band.,7,jfnr0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/jfnr0x/metallica_is_overrated_and_is_not_the_best_metal/,15,2020-10-22 06:59:30,"Now before you get all up in arms and start calling me a hater, I want to make it clear that I do not think Metallica is a bad band. There isn't a doubt in my mind that Metallica has released quality metal masterpieces such as Kill Em All or Ride The Lightning. At the same point however, Metallica's career has been a rather rocky one, as their releases have ranged from excellent (KEA, RTL), great (MOP, AJFA), good (DM), meh/mediocre (TBA, Load, ReLoad, Hardwired), to garbage (St. Anger, Lulu). It is for this very reason why I don't agree with many people about Metallica being the best metal band. From my point of view, in order for a band or artist to be considered ""the best"" for their genre, they need to have a near flawless career. Such is not the case with Metallica, as even most of their diehard fans agree that only about half of their albums are good.

If the claims about Metallica releasing a new album next year are true, I really hope it's an improvement over Hardwired. In my opinion, Hardwired was a pretty disappointing album and it didn't live up to its predecessor, Death Magnetic - which I felt was a nice throwback to their 80s sound. Now of course, Hardwired follows suit to Death Magnetic by also adapting a thrash metal sound, but it doesn't do as good of a job with it as DM did. In a general sense, Hardwired feels largely bland and uninspired. James' vocals are okay at best, Kirk's riffs are kinda forgettable, and Lars' drumming leaves something to be desired. If I'm being honest, there's really only five songs from Hardwired I consider good, those songs being Hardwired, Atlas Rise, Now That We're Dead, Moth Into Flame, and Spit Out the Bone. This wouldn't be such a bad thing if Hardwired had maybe 7 or 8 songs, but it has 12, meaning that more than half of the album fails to deliver.

As a whole, Metallica is a good band, but they are NOT the best metal band. James is a fine vocalist, but he's no Rob Halford or Ronnie James Dio. Kirk is a good guitarist, but his riffs aren't as well written as Dave Mustaine's or Chuck Schuldiner's. Lars was good at drums for Metallica's first four albums, but  nowadays, he's a complete joke and he can barely hold a tempo (and let's not forget the awful trash can snare he used on St. Anger). He is inferior to other metal drummers such as Nick Menza, Dave Lombardo, and Gene Hoglan. Cliff is a different story. He was definitely one of the best metal bassists there was and I'm actually at a loss right now to think of a better bass player than him. However, Jason and Rob aren't especially great as bassists, and the tone of their instruments doesn't really stand out much, unlike that of Cliff's tone.

With all this being said, I can't say I'm surprised with many people claiming Metallica is the best metal band, due to the fact that Metallica are the most popular band in their respective genre. However, I also believe that most people who make this claim haven't explored the genre very much, and are merely piggybacking on what many of their peers are saying.",unpopularopinion

 As consumers, we can influence those choices by not buying the latest title or stop playing a certain game, thus our voice could get heard.
 
 Clearly the majority of people who buys games nowadays don’t care enough and this is the simple reason why companies like EA, Activion and such SHOULD and rightfully make this moves. 

 If your company is making less money than the precedent year, your at a loss and management sees it as a red flag. For this reason they push to surpass the number achieved the year before and we can’t change that.

 The only way to change those conducts is trying to raise awareness and not supporting franchises like FIFA or 2K.



TLDR: Running a company is about making more money than the previous year. Most people keep buying games regardless ads and micro-transaction so complaining without taking actions is useless.

The presentation and music was mediocre, monsters were laughably modeled (they weren't scary at all imo) and the story is very spooky fanfiction tier with a naked ghost men floating and cursing you at the end. It's super cheesy. 

People often throw out that Machine for Pigs had removed mechanics, but apart from some decent puzzles I don't think they removed that much. Insanity didn't add much, monsters are despawned in original if they ""kill you"" so I basically just ran into them to avoid the hassle, there is always plenty of oil, etc.

All Amnesia games are basically walking simulators, and I think Machine for Pigs at least had good voice acting, decent ambitions in the story (a bit too on the nose, but at least it has something to say besides uuuu Lovecraft) and the music was beautiful. Especially if you compare the ending of both games you'll see which one gives you more emotions.

I'm writing this because Rebirth is a pretty disappointing (and in my opinion the worst one of the bunch), which is a shame because I loved SOMA. It seemed like in SOMA, they worked a lot on atmosphere and writing, and here everything seems like a B team made it. I like a line in the Steam review, which states that a random Oblivion cave is more atmospheric than the ones in Rebirth, and I must sadly agree.

Anyway. I enjoyed Machine for Pigs the most, or at least it was the most memorable of the bunch.

It’s for doing your business and getting the f out.

Limited options and much smaller cup sizes for a lot more money. This has been 99% of my experience with local coffee. 

My favorite thing about Starbucks is the customizability. Want 2% instead of whole? Skim or even Almond milk instead? Soy or coconut milk? It’s all there. Add ins like Caramel or cinnamon syrup which are also available in a sugar free form are all there. Iced coffee, cold brew, and nitrogen infused coffee are all options too where as local usually only has one of those things to fill the “cold coffee” slot. Not to mention all the seasonal flavors too. Starbucks by far has the most options for you to make the perfect cup.

Yes, I am that person who wears shoes around their house, literally until I’m in bed- unless I change into soled slippers.

This all being said- I NEVER put my shoes on furniture, I think we can all at least agree that’s barbaric. Reasons outlined below:

1. If you have pets with fur there is no possible way to avoid fur on the bottom of your feet, no matter how often you vacuum. Fur on the bottom of your feet is icky. Any granules stuck to your sole is icky. 

2. It gets cold without shoes. I’d rather have the shoes on and not be cold. 

3. I aim for 10k steps a day and it hurts if I don’t wear my sneakers, keeping my shoes on gives me more opportunity to get my steps. 

4. I wipe off my sneakers before I come into the house. I am not tracking much dirt in; maybe I’m bringing in *some* but the pet hair and pet tracking from my dogs being in the yard kind of negates whatever I do 

5. I often go outside to check on my chickens, ducks, dogs, multiple times per day: often every hour. Why bother taking off my shoes in between when it’s cold and uncomfortable? Plus, I’ve been able to chase off multiple foxes in the past few months by being able to shoot outside at a moments notice. 

6. I have soled slippers and sneakers. Please explain why my soled slippers are more acceptable to wear in the house than my sneakers? 

7. I will always take my shoes off when requested at another persons house but the last time it happened was after a 12 hour shift at work where I was running around like crazy and I knew my feet smelled gross.

Background: I ran a retail store for 6 years. We held many fundraisers for various charities. For Mother’s Day we always donated a portion of sales to Pancreatic cancer research because that’s what took my grandmother from us and she meant so much to our family. 

Even saying that - our motives were not totally selfless. If they were, we wouldn’t advertise it. We wouldn’t make social media posts about it. 

The truth is, charity reflects well on the business - which generates more positive buzz people which generates more customers and higher profits. I don’t think that’s wrong per se, but it’s certainly not nothing. I am the first to admit that. 

I would argue that in the popularity economy, individuals who have “birthday fundraisers” on Facebook or use hashtags or whatever to “raise awareness” for causes are rarely doing it *purely* out of the goodness of their hearts. 

It makes them look good. That’s 90% of the reason people are on Instagram is to effectively brag about how great they are or their life is or their workout plan is or whatever so, at best a donation or hashtag has the “bonus” of making them look good, at worst it’s the true motive behind it. 

There are a lot of people and companies who are truly passionate about helping people, raising awareness, raising funds for a specific need or goal (ie. a new piece of equipment for a nursing home or a new wheelchair for a little boy) there are many short term fundraisers with a specific end goal in mind and in most of those cases the people who are running them are truly passionate about that thing. 

But # TaintCancerAwareness # FightTaintCancer # NoMakeupTaintCancerSelfie # Courage 

That shit is so see-thru you clearly just want likes and attention on the backs of a real cause. 

Now the unanswerable question is: “does it matter why they’re doing it, as long as the charity still benefits from money or awareness?”

Additionally, in an ideal situation, you are bringing a child into this world with a person that you are in love with. Each stretch mark or otherwise perceived imperfection tells a beautiful story. Your partner brought your child into this work, and that's a badge of honor. I think seeing my partner bring a child into the world would only increase my attraction to her. 

Part of me feels this way feels this way simply because it's what I'm attracted to. Ripped, flat stomachs don't do it for me. The other part of me feels this way because I am a romantic at heart and I'd be bursting with love if I am ever blessed with meeting the right person to go on that journey with.",unpopularopinion

The whole world should adapt to the full UK electrical system,2,jflfk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/jflfk9/the_whole_world_should_adapt_to_the_full_uk/,45,2020-10-22 04:52:37,"Here's why (for simplicity ill use the US for comparison)

1: 240v>120v running appliances on 240v will draw half the current than 120v, this puts less stress on the power lines and therefore making them more reliable 

2: UK plugs are WAY safer, have you ever plugged a type A or B (north American) plug in only halfway and gotten a nasty shock? On a UK plug its impossible to do so because the bottom half of the prongs are wrapped in plastic. UK outlets also have doors on the socket holes, meaning you can't plug anything in them until the ground door is opened first. The type G (United Kingdom) plugs also have fuses inside the trip at whatever current is above what the appliance is rated for. A neat thing about the wiring in a UK plug is that if the wire is pulled on, the first wire to disconnect is the live, followed by neutral, and then earth. UK outlets also have switches on them so you can choose when the outlets are live and when they're not.

3: RCD is safer than GFCI, GFCI (ground fault circuit interrupter) is typically only in bathrooms (there's one GFCI outlet in my kitchen but I don't think that's the case for every house) whereas RCD protects the entire house (granted RCD trips at around 20MAH compared to GFCI at 5MAH)

""doing that would be expensive"" it's like buying a rolls royce phantom, it's expensive but is worth it

""Why can we just use type A and B plugs with 240v"" do you have a death wish???

Black pepper on eggs, grits, steak or literally any meat, salads, or sandwich is just gross. It might be tolerable if it were added in a way that was well balanced, but most people add it out of habit without actual thought to taste.

I did an elimination diet last year and learned that I was eating a lot of foods that I really don't enjoy out of habit, and now I only eat things I like. I can easily pick most things out of a dish but black pepper isn't one of them. The number of things I've ordered and just tossed because the black pepper ruined it is just ridiculous!

I rarely order steak when eating out but if I do I explicitly say, ""Absolutely no seasoning except salt,"" because whatever ground spice mix they like to use is invariably full of unevenly ground pepper and it's disgusting. They will still often send it out with black pepper on it.

I travel a lot and was flying through ATL recently. I thought I'd get some grits for breakfast since I wouldn't be able to have them where I was going. Two bites in and I throw them away, totally inedible because of black pepper. Who puts pepper in grits? And who puts so much on that it's not edible?

Cabbage is just a perfect pairing for black pepper, though it should still be a fine, even grind. No one enjoys biting into a chunk of pepper, and maybe more people should make the black pepper vodka a la Alton Brown for the flavor without the chunks if they're incapable of using a functional grinder.

Forbidden Journey at Wizarding World, you walk through the castle. Maybe suggest people come 10-15 minutes before their scheduled time so they can walk through and see everything, and watch the various sections of the Trio talking to the crowd.) 

I don't think it's an unpopular opinion that waiting in line *sucks*. A lot of the rides at the more popular parks like Disney and Universal can be over an hour long. It'd be much more productive if people could just register for a time to go ride, and then have to wait maybe 20 minutes; that gives people more time to get food, go shopping, sit down and relax, ride shorter rides/rides with shorter wait times. And when it gets closer to park closing, feels more like a guarantee you'll get on the ride. I'm not sure if guests have ever been turned away for getting there too late, but when I went to Disneyland during the Halloween season, I was in line for an hour and a half for Haunted Mansion, and the park was pretty much closed by the time I finished... and there was still a line behind me. 

 It seems like it'd be so much more productive, and a better way to spend the day.

Just because it's a ripoff doesn't automatically make it bad, and while the ""product placements"" were a bit excessive they did not really take away from the movie (for me at least).

Movies like They Saved Hitler's Brain, Ballistic: Ecks vs Sever, and Monster a Go Go!

If someone makes a statement, and you care about the factuality of the statement, then you carry that burden by way of caring about the subject. While its great if someone gives citation to help you cannot force them. Why should you believe an assertion without evidence? You shouldnt. But likewise, if you care about having justified beliefs you cannot reject the assertion without evidence.  


If you still think a burden exists please explain from when that burden springs? What obligates a person to another?

They are hideous.

 True, the pictures are nice and cute, but behind the charm there's a measure of casual sadism that I simply can't take. No, I'm not new to cruel fairy tales, and I think that children should get some of the details from, say, Brothers Grimm when they are ready - but the animals of Beatrix Potter are seemingly cruel for the sake of being cruel, or assholes for no good reason. Nutkin is nearly skinned for being an asshole - with the other squirrels maintaining their silence (I don't even want to question the ethics of sentient squirrels killing sentient mice and sentient moles to satisfy a sentient owl for some nut harvest). Tiptoes is beaten half-dead and left to die in an empty stump by other squirrels, where he is rescued by a chipmunk who left his wife just because (and he doesn't return to her for a while). Tom Kitten and his brothers are robbed, well, just because. 

 What's more, this is not the casual sadism of ""classic fairy tales"" - this is a very well-developed sadism of modern literature, explained in detail on many pages. It takes six pages to early bake Tom Kitten into a pie, with a description befitting ""The Library Policeman"" by Steven King. There's a whole book on how a sentient frog slowly devours sentient bees in the house of a sentient mouse, for Christ's sake! And, no, there's no greater moral here hidden anywhere - *this is literally the whole story*, with the mouse cleaning up afterwards and inviting other mice as if nothing happened! It's hardly alone - there's a story of how a frog nearly died during fishing, a story of how the rabbit was nearly killed by a farmer, and a story of how baby bunnies were nearly killed - *all without any single moral*. It's not like something embedded in a bigger fairy tale - it was just the literary equivalent of a gory video, where the outcome seemingly was irrelevant to the detailed description of suffering over many pages.

Enjoying a social experience with people you love is genuine celebration. Gift-giving can be a part of that, but it's spoiled by our over-use of it as a culture. We're all just better off taking a break from doing that for a good few years. 

Giving is a good thing. I give gifts to my girlfriend all the time, and it works because it's when she least expects it. We go out on our anniversary. But when I see something for her that I know is perfect, I don't wait until our anniversary to give it. We celebrate when it's appropriate and we give when it's unexpected. 

And let's not forget to mention the performative nature of formally opening gifts in a group setting. Or the selfish culture of materialism it teaches kids. But I'm sure others have touched on those topics in this sub.

1. Insecure ""masculine"" men who think boosting about how much sex they get is cool, and who probably have low self-esteem secretly.
2. The rare few types of males who can get high quality sex from larger numbers of hot women, where as the regular male cannot.
3. People who are still stuck in the 19th century and think that sex toys are gay/low T/degenerate etc

I use to believe that just jerking off to porn using your hand or toys could never possibly compare to the real thing, but after a while I realized that most women look fat or mediocre and that many toys made for males are now actually pretty high quality. I'm not talking about things like dolls etc but just the various different masturbation toys. I'm now of the view that using a toy+porn is legit better than mediocre sex with some fat woman.

When I say this the go to counter-argument seems to be ""oh but GOOD sex is ALWAYS better!""

Ok but how many males even get to have this ""good"" sex? The average male is not having hot porn star sex with attractive women. They are hooking up with fatties or otherwise mediocre looking girls. This invalidates their argument.

Fact is that now that we have porn (and VR porn especially) in addition to high quality toys real sex has become overrated as fuk if you are not banging a very good looking girl.

Imagine everything in life is going great and then one day... Boom something you've said or done years ago goes viral. Say goodbye to all that time and effort building a career/relationship ect..

That's just one of so many aspects of it.. flat earthers, hate groups ect.. all flourish on social media. Conspiracies and prejudices that were once rightly left in the dark are brought to the light and distributed in mass on social media.",unpopularopinion
Community Service Should NOT be Mandatory in Schools,19,jfhmwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/jfhmwm/community_service_should_not_be_mandatory_in/,19,2020-10-22 01:40:48,"People say that community service are beneficial to the individual, improves social skills and awareness, and helps the individual succeed in his or her career. A person who does community service is associated with a strong quality of life, kindness, and being useful to the society. In fact, one person on Quora stated that ""If you didn’t do something useful in life outside in school, it shows you’re a useless duntz who can follow direction. Congratulations. You’re not a benefit to society, to the economy, or to innovation"". I had to chuckle at this statement because it's ironic that the people who try to spread positivity by requiring community service are actually discriminating the ones who don't. 

Community service is great, but nobody should forget that nothing is perfect. Just because something is beneficial to a group of people doesn't mean everyone should be required to do that. People are not forced to eat spicy foods because a group of people likes it; sex is good for the body but no one is required to do it; and why doesn't schools make traveling mandatory just because it benefits the student? Everything has its pros and cons, we shouldn't stick to the good part of community service and forget the rest.

Also, as a general rule of thumb, I hate everything that I'm forced to do. Just like a person on Quora stated, ""if you make it mandatory, then you take away the essential motivation behind volunteerism and replace it with what is essentially a profit motive. Rather the opposite of service, which is based on empathy, caring and the desire to do something constructive for the benefit of others"". I already have a ton of homework and after school activities, there is no reason for me to make it harder on myself be recycling plastic every Thursday. If I were forced to care and be kind to someone, it will only increase my hate toward that individual and the whole thing. Community service doesn't prevent crimes; people can commit a crime right after a service, and people can be perfectly good citizens without any service history.

You may say that community service is not currently mandatory in every school, but is it? The counselors recommend it, the parents pressure their kids, the society looks down on people who don't do it, and good colleges will rather have students that have done community service. Sure, it's not explicitly stated in the rules of some schools, but it's implicitly stated in all. One community service program in my school said that ""you are not required to attend this, but it will look good on your college application."" I would say that I felt kindly threatened. In general, high school be like you can choose any class you want as long as you have 3 credits of this, 2 credits of that, and 1.5 credits of that, and 6 credits of that, and one year of American History, and one year of U.S. Government, and ...

In conclusion, community service should not be mandatory; it does not suit and benefit everybody. Nor should community service be implicitly stated in any rules, and nor should students feel pressured by the parents, teachers, counselors, and society. Remember the original intention of community service, and don't get carried away with it.

Hot summers are better than freezing winters,2,jfhc8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/jfhc8p/hot_summers_are_better_than_freezing_winters/,6,2020-10-22 01:25:58,"I’ve lived in both hot and cold States in the USA (Massachusetts, New Hampshire, California, and Florida respectively) and from experience, I can say that places in the south with hot summers and mild winters beat places with mild summers and harsh winters. People who I talk to down south constantly complain about the heat in the summer, but I just don’t believe they know how good they have it compared to the north.

One reason is seasonal depression. Winters in the north are drab, gloomy, and void of life. You don’t realize how much you miss the color green until you have to sit in a grey/brown world for seven long months. In Florida things are green and flowers are blooming year round. (Before you mention fall colors, you have to understand that they don’t last for more than a week or two).

My second reason is the uncomfortable temperatures. I’ll admit, southern heat is abysmal and I do believe people have a right to complain about it. But let me indulge you about cold weather problems. Chapped lips, dry skin, and scratchy throats are some of the most common cold ailments. Plus, when you’re outside your face muscles freeze and you lose feeling in your hands and toes, even with protective clothing on. Now that I’ve mentioned clothing, having to put on layers just to go outside and STILL be uncomfortable is why the cold feels worse.

My third and final reason is inconveniences. When there’s two to three feet of snow turned ice sitting in your driveway in the morning, you’ll be pretty pissed off because you can’t leave your house until it’s shoveled. After and hour of shoveling (plus medical risks if you’re older or have heart problems) you can finally get your car out. OH WAIT! Your windshield and windows are covered in snow. After five minutes of brushing off snow, you notice yet ANOTHER layer of ice. You can try to scrape it off but you will probably end up having to sit in your car shivering for ten minutes to warm it up enough to melt. Now you can finally drive. But be careful! There’s black ice on the road and you can end up in a collision if you lose control while going over it. Also, once you start walking to work, make sure there’s a railing nearby so you don’t slip on ice and break your skull or tailbone. Meanwhile in warm places people are just going about life normally.

There you have it: why cold winters are worse than hot summers.",unpopularopinion

Sad scenes are truly sad. Harry's death is heartbreaking. Seeing him and Peter finally put things aside and team up is more satisfying than anything you see today. The motivations are all explained very well. It's campy/corny when it needs to be and deathly serious when it chooses to be. No one has quite mastered the balancing of tones that Sam Raimi brings to his movies. He is truly a man with a vision. He directs the ever living fuck out of his movies.

It was standard for me to have a glass of milk with breakfast. Every time I did, I felt my stomach bloat and a sense of mild nausea. Since I didn't know about lactose intolerance, I thought it was normal to feel this way after a meal. I thought my body was saying, ""That was a good meal! I feel so full right now!"" 

Today I know what milk does to me but I still have it anyway. It is what it is I guess.

Why do I like drinking milk, you ask? I don't know: I guess old (childhood) habits die hard. I have gotten used to the discomfort and I just ride the cramps/nausea till they pass. But honestly, I just love milk. I mean, it's titty juice. How can any sane person not like titty juice?! Cows are like my breakfast spirit animal!

Maybe I'm a masochist in enjoying something that discomfits me. Maybe we all are masochists about some things. Anyway, I'm pretty sure I'm in the minority of lactose intolerant people who like milk. But if I'm not, leave a comment below and let me know about it!",unpopularopinion

I think the key in photos is to show authenticity and be congruent with your emotions. 
If you truly are feeling good, sure, smile. It will probably look great because it is true, but don’t be pressured into smiling just because someone wants you to for a photo.

Maybe this isn’t an unpopular opinion? But it’s hard to tell because society blah blah blah I never used to open up about some of my interests because I don’t want to be judged by other men.

When I was younger I was under a lot of pressure to be manly. My dad wanted me to be outdoorsy, active, and into manly things. However, when I was younger... I just wasn’t. I liked staying inside and playing video games. I liked writing instead of running. I liked to watch cartoons and ‘girly’ anime because it was relaxing.

I spent a long time feeling like I was a weirdo because I didn’t like playing sports or going on hikes and being ‘manly.’ And that really negatively effected me for years, even though I know my dad was trying to protect me from being teased and bullied. It took me until I was around 19 to finally be comfortable openly expressing my interest in less traditionally masculine things, but this post isn’t about me; it’s about men in general. 

I think, because men are so heavily expected to be masculine (and women are expected to be feminine but I can’t really speak on that for obvious reasons), it’s far more manly to express your less-traditional interests than it is to force yourself to conform. If being manly is about being confident in yourself and your interests? Then it’s a hell of a lot harder to do that when society suggests you’re weird for it. It’s perfectly fine and valid to be a grown man who likes knitting and going to book club, or whatever your interests are. It doesn’t make you less of a man, it makes you braver than any man who’s going to shame you for not being a cliche. It’s easy to be a dick, and it certainly doesn’t make you manly.

And the thing is, you CAN have both interests. Now that I’m older? I love the outdoors and expressing myself in manly ways, but I express myself that way because I want to, not because people expect me too.

Tl;dr Masculine and manly are different, and not being masculine doesn’t make you not manly or weird.",unpopularopinion

We frequently hear about how the rich are getting richer at the expense of the poor, how rich people are jerks or sociopaths and that's what made them successful, how some company lied through their teeth and broke a dozen laws to make a ton of money and then didn't get penalized for it, how people with power are becoming physically abusive to those without it, or how corrupt businesses and politics in general can be.

These things are constantly in the news, and people wonder why the little guy can't catch a break. We try to be good people. We work hard and do our best, and yet somehow it feels like we always get the bad end of the deal.

While ""good"" and ""bad"" are open to individual interpretation, people who adhere to the personality traits that we were told to embody as children are usually seen as good people, but instead of being rewarded for it, they're often punished for it.

1. Be kind = Get walked on, used, & abused - If you stand up for yourself, you're seen as being ""mean"".

2. Have a positive attitude and only say positive things = Don't stand up for yourself or address a problem, even if presenting a solution. Negativity is unattractive (see #1) and people don't like problems OR messengers. Instead, just ignore them and hope that they go away, even though they won't, and will only continue to get worse over time.

3. Be a hard worker and have a good work ethic = Pick up the slack and extra work for all of your coworkers and boss without any sort of thanks or compensation. You don't like that? Refer to #2.

4. Be good at what you do = There are lots of people who are good at what you do, so spend all of your time, even personal time, trying to be even better than all of them. You won't be compensated for it, but refer to #2 and #3. And never forget - there are a million people who can take your place, and your company is willing to pay your replacement, even if they won't pay you.

5. Do a lot of things = #3 + #4 x ? number of roles, and all so that no one has any idea what you actually do, so you'll be phased out.

6. Be a team player = Let your bosses walk all over you and your coworkers take credit for your work.

7. Respect your elders = Do what you're told without thinking so that they can yell at you for having a mind of your own AND for not thinking for yourself, and let them abuse you in general, because they've earned it by putting up with other people doing this to them for longer than you have.

8. Listen to those who know more than you = This is entirely based on the perception of the person giving you this advice, and therefore includes people who know nothing, and lie to you constantly about their knowledge. And of course, question nothing at all, because how much do you REALLY know?

9. Trust others and give them the benefit of the doubt = They will betray you, because they know that they can lie to you and you'll believe them.

10. Tell the truth = ... so that people can (possibly purposefully) misinterpret and get offended by every miniscule thing that you say, even if it is straight fact, so you can be seen as ""unprofessional"" for not towing the company line, and you can be fired for offending someone.

11. Don't lie, cheat, or steal = Give everyone else an unfair advantage, because you're ""better"" than them somehow by adhering to ""good"" behaviors that you are not in any way shape or form rewarded for.

12. Don't manipulate people = Good luck finding a customer-facing job that pays a livable wage, and definitely don't even think about standing up to your bosses or coworkers when they're trying to manipulate you, because they'll accuse you of manipulating them instead.

13. Be supportive and put others first = Make everything about everyone else and ignore your own needs. Hopefully if you only focus on them, they'll like you, and maybe one day they MIGHT care about something that you need... maybe...

There's a reason that people say, ""Nice guys finish last."" You don't have to be a bad person to succeed in life, but being a good person makes it significantly harder, if not almost impossible, unless your personal definition of success is simply ""to be a good person"".

That's not to say that we shouldn't teach our children to embody these traits, but we should start rewarding people for these traits instead of manipulating and abusing them and throwing all of our opportunities and money at fads and people who are already successful.

A real tomato is red, a real tomato is misshaped, a real tomato is firm and full of bitter-sweet taste, it smells fresh and isn't mushy.

  My grandma grows tomatoes in her own garden, nothing too big just enough to give the whole family one or two small crates. Those are some of the best tomatoes I have ever eaten, they're bulky and red and very misshaped but the flavour is like nothing you've ever tasted. After they were harvested we would sit and just eat tomatoes whit cow chees (look it up, its also really tasty) from her own cow, we would just bite into one while harvesting, real tomatoes are great you just need to know which ones are good.

  It could just be a taste I associated with childhood and with the summers I used to spend at my grandparents house but I can very well tell the difference between a store bought one and one from the farmers market.

  I admit I also don't like the ones you find in burgers and those in similar foods but that doesn't mean I don't like tomatoes it just means I don't like bad, tasteless tomatoes. You wouldn't go get a haircut and after getting a bad one say you don't like hair so why do tomatoes get such a bad rep?

A parent is supposed to prepare their children for adulthood, not censor them until they reach adulthood. Parents should teach their children the meaning of these words, and properly explain their definitions, context, and appropriate uses. There is absolutely no reason to scold a child for using cuss words, as they are just common vocabulary words used to express strong feelings like pain, anger, disagreement, et cetera. 

Furthermore, someone who isn't even the child's parent has no justifiable reason nor the obligation to scold another person's kid for saying cuss words. 

Say a kid trips in public and blurts out the F word, a random bystander then says ""Watch your mouth!"", that person is out of line, and is extremely rude.

In conclusion, children should be tought about cuss words and their uses, and parents or other adults shouldn't punish or scold children for using them.


Addendum for clarity: Teach children to give other people proper respect! Do not scold children for saying a cuss word when they trip and fall, step on a Lego, or call a bully at school an A hole! These are appropriate uses of cuss words.

Spelling should not be that big of a deal,0,jf9a2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/jf9a2e/spelling_should_not_be_that_big_of_a_deal/,14,2020-10-21 16:53:30,"Here's my attempt at making a compelling case against the prestige of standard spelling. Disclaimer: I'm not a linguist by trade but I have studied it extensively at university and it has remained an important hobby for me ever since. Also, my native language is (European) French, and my sentiment mostly stems from country's weird, elitist obsession with spelling, but I believe it can translate well to native or non-native English speakers.

Also, I am going to compare non-standard spelling habits to non-standard accents a lot. It's not a perfect simile, but I think it gets my point across (about variants that can be stigmatized, but don't have to). 

1) The basic idea

Spelling should not be standardized the way it is today. Or, at least, spelling variants should be able to co-exist freely in the linguistic community free of judgement. For instance, even though ""would have"" might be standard spelling in formal writing, ""would of"" shouldn't get the backlash it usually gets. Same with ""there"" and ""their"". Similar to how it's ok if people have non-standard accents (I know some people can still be pretty pissed off about this but I'm willing to believe that no one here thinks we should all be speaking the queen's English). Kind of pointless to say that people should just change the way they think, but hey, this is reddit.

To be clear, I'm not saying standard spelling should be overhauled to accommodate today's speech (although that would be nice), what I'm saying is: fuck all, write however you like. 

2) Why I believe this would be beneficial

- Less fuss about learning how to spell in school, which is less of a skill and more of a list of weird arbitrary rules. 
- If you're not that great at spelling, you don't have to feel bad about it anymore. 
- The ability to spell the standard way is a marker of social class - but it doesn't have to (again, not sure how you'd enforce that change, this all just a thought experiment). Accents are also a class marker, but you don't often get interrupted mid-sentence if you prononce a word with a strong burr or a twang. But you do get nasty comments online if you happen to misuse ""you're"", even though that's beside the point and also pretty dickish.
- So much variety! 

3) Debunking why you might think this is a terrible idea, understandably

- Messy spelling is harder to read: true, but only because we're not used to it! Other accents are harder to understand when we're not used to hearing them, until we learn to. I'd go as far as saying that standard spelling prevents us from learning how to read each other's unique idiolects! 
- Messy spelling will hurt our ability to think and speak clearly: that's a common misconception. Writing doesn't precede speech, it's just a way of marking it down. Research doesn't show that bad spellers are inherently less articulate than good spellers.
- Does that mean we can spell everything anyway we want to? Like that fish-ghoti thing? Well yes I suppose so, but the point is to write in a way that's comfortable to you, and actively obscuring what you're trying to say is not a good strategy to achieve that. Back to the accent metaphor again, just because you can speak without getting insulted for your native accent doesn't mean it's a good idea to speak random rubbish that even you can't understand. 
- What about sentences where spelling is the only way of knowing what you're supposed to understand? Well, truly ambiguous situations are fairly rare, because usually context clarifies everything. Otherwise you wouldn't be able to understand the difference between, say, ""their cats"" and ""they're cats"" even in oral speech. 

There. Discuss.

"Raisins have more potential in food than chocolate, the chocolate industry knows this and has actively covered it up.",0,jf92uj,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/jf92uj/raisins_have_more_potential_in_food_than/,10,2020-10-21 16:34:09,"Raisins are a long debated subject some think raisins are delicious and a great way to imbed fruit into foods while others think the idea of them is bland and like grandma boring and wrinkled.

I personally don't care about this argument as it's been argued to death what I think is true is that raisins are an untapped gold mine for culinary lovers  and that the chocolate industry has created a cover up due to the cost of raisins. Think about it raisins are mostly found along side other expensive trail foods like nuts and breads because they offer sweetness without melting or overpowering the strong flavors of a mix or bread, a perfect amount of sweet fruitiness in every bite.

However anything that has raisins are expensive compared to chocolate and are generally when compared via 100g more expensive than whole milk chocolate. Now viewing this from a manufacturers point of view you have to see how raisins are usually used.

Raisins are commonly found in breads, mixes, soft cookies and yogurt parfait. What do all of these have in common? They are locally either expensive or hold almost no raisins compared to chocolate products of the same gram weight.

Take nut mixes a combo of the 2: they are expensive due to the nuts and hold little to no chocolate if raisins are found in the same mix because of the premium price you pay for said mix however take a look between oatmeal raisin cookies and chocolate cookies and there is a big difference between the 2.

Chocolate cookies are more common, come with more cookies and keep longer than raisin cookies due to moister content and because crisp cookies with fruit generally aren't as popular in the western world. In Canada and the United States crispy raisin cookies are strictly used as a dipping cookie in a hot drink where chocolate would melt, they are also generally more expensive due to the finer ingredients needed to make them up to this standard. 

This is the biggest problem! Raisins are simply not given the same love due to 1 important thing: they need more ingredients to function in their role. In a culinary perspective this is a good thing as the marry of flavor can have very good effects on texture, flavor, nutrition and presentation however to mass produce them would require more of those ingredients and the time to test them cost probably millions more than chocolate.

A chocolate cookie can take 3 forms: a sandwich cookie, a crispy cookie and a soft cookie. For the purpose of the argument we will ignore the sandwich cookie as really it's own thing but for crispy and soft cookies using chocolate one thing is clear the ingredients are roughly the same as a basic chocolate cookie needs generally less expensive materials to make and can be toyed with to give different outcomes based on flour used. Raisin cookies on the other hand need stronger chewy materials to offset it's chewy natural skin. This generally means less product per harvest, more time invested into the making of different cookies with the same ingredients and most importantly the cost of the more whole materials.

This culmination is the direct result of the chocolate industry who know that they can make more money by selling cheap mass produced chocolate cookies than more expensive harder to make raisin cookies. That's why you never see raisin cookies as a flag ship of a cookie brand  because the chocolate industry is cheaper to buy from and easier to make into the cheap lovable prepacked cookies in store.

The amount of fruit that can give it's flavor to a raisin can beat out chocolate ten fold because it is not limited to just one plant, grapes, cranberries, Huckleberries, Saskatoon berries, if it it's small and can be dried out you have a raisin. Not to mention the grape raisins change so much depending on what type of grape it's dried from, need a more wine like pop? Golden raisins! A deep rich graph flavor? Black raisins! So many different types while with our chocolate you get no Coca butter, some Coca butter and mostly Coca butter (and other fillers). Breads, cookies heck even tarts and pies all welcome the concentrated flavors of raisins to carry something that is savory to a sweet pedestal. Yet simply for the fact that they are not chocolate and more expensive they are second class dessert material.

You'll never see raisin cookies been advertised or Santa sitting down with raisin cookies and milk because the chocolate industry has covered it up and will trick you into thinking that those are not the cookies of a modern generation, they're for old people who have lost the taste of their youth or grandma's last ditch effort to the pot luck, tea loafs and raisin bread will be treated as sweet treats but never desserts because chocolate cakes and cookies are the easy cheap way to bring the smell of baked goods to the dessert table. Butter tarts and pies with raisins will forever be seen as the grandma food of the after dinner potluck because chocolate brownies and puddings are youthful and rich. Raisins will never see the stockings of a loved one because if they aren't cover in chocolate they are ""healthy"" and of bad taste. And raisins will forever be tossed into the discarded trick or treat bowl because the chocolate covered sugar bars are just ""so much better"".

Raisins deserve better! They deserve our love, our attention and our skills to create new desserts in the kitchen, because of we allow raisins to spearhead our culinary desires we may one day finally treat them with the long aged respect they deserve in a world where fruit and dessert meet at a perfect crossroads while people sit eating chocolate and raisin cookies as equals.

I feel like BODMAS could be made completely redundant by teaching kids straight away to use a(b) to signify a product and a fraction for division, then stating that anything in () is a single term, i.e 8 / 2 * 4 cant be done without a rule such as BODMAS but 4(8/2) is fine.

Body soap does more harm than good.,0,jf8b8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/jf8b8o/body_soap_does_more_harm_than_good/,17,2020-10-21 15:24:00,"I hardly ever use body soap while taking a shower. I usually just scrub my armpits, face and crotch area vigorously with my hands and sometimes a tiny bit of mild soap when feeling extra dirty. Rest of the body is just scrubbed lightly, rinsed and I suspect the towel afterwards act as a good dry brush of the skin. I don't do manual labor that makes me stinky and GF and me don't notice any bad body odor on me. As did previous romantic partners. So it begs the question/discussion, if one *isn't* covered in grease or sticky dirt, does one actually really need body soap to wash the body?

I'm asking because for hundred thousand of years our ancestors didn't had soap. I suspect our skin developed in such a way that it is just fine [without using soap](https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/is-soap-bad-for-skin#How-to-ditch-your-soap-for-good). Just water and some hands scrubbing is more than enough. 

There is this for-profit incentive that goes beyond what a human skin is build for. For decades & decades we have been told by skilled marketeers that we need soap. As with most things presented to us like this, it has become a religion. Try talking a girlfriend out of her facial cleansing products. Ain't going to happen.  So, unfortunately, this religious believe one *needs* body soap while showering, hampers most discussions on this subject: no soap => you stink like a wet dog.

But it doesn't with me and many others like me. I don't have smelly feet and I don't smell like an onion after a good climbing session. I maintain a strict hygiene level regarding my bed sheets, my clothes, my shoes and I hardly use body soap. Body soap is [unnecessary for daily use](https://www.reddit.com/r/Permaculture/comments/152bj3/a_report_on_what_happens_when_you_dont_use_soap), it does more harm then good.

Ugly and broken guys will settle with the only ugly woman who ever gave a damn about them and call them ""the love of my life"".

Guys aged 70+ with plenty of money and power will be 'In love' with young, gorgeous women younger enough to be their grand daughters. Yet these girls will also be 'madly in love' with them.

"Breastfeeding doesn't come easy to most moms, and telling women who persevere that they are ""lucky"" they were able to breastfeed is insulting.",10,jf6c9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/jf6c9f/breastfeeding_doesnt_come_easy_to_most_moms_and/,11,2020-10-21 12:42:00,"This isn't a Breast is Best vs. Fed is Best argument at all. The way a woman ends up feeding their baby is no ones business but their own. Here comes the unpopular opinion:

Breastfeeding is harder than formula feeding. It's often very painful for the first few weeks. It's anxiety inducing because you're always concerned about over/under supply. It's more easily digested by the baby, which in turn means that they wake up more often and eat more frequently than formula fed babies. If you want to establish a good supply then you exclusively breastfeed throughout the night every hour or two. No one can take your place and let you get extra sleep. This goes on for weeks. Cluster feeding is when the baby literally feeds for HOURS on end without stop. Mastitis. Thrush. Milk Blisters. Engorgement. Blocked Ducts. Abscesses.

So when a mother who struggled to breastfeed and ultimately turned to formula says to a mom who is breastfeeding ""oh, you're so lucky you were able to breastfeed"" it sounds a lot like ""you had it easy and I had it hard."" I mean, all moms have it hard to a certain extent, and this isn't the pain olympics - that's not the point of this post. It's that breastfeeding moms should be able to say ""this is damn hard, and I didn't just get lucky"" without constantly being told by formula feeding moms that they had it so much harder.

And because I know some comments will say ""I did xyz and couldn't produce enough milk"" - yes, I do feel sympathy, but that doesn't mean the breastfeeding mom is ""lucky."" The breastfeeding mom likely worked all day every day to ensure that BFing worked out. She didn't just fall into an easy routine. It got easier over time after a lot of hard work. There are exceptions to everything, but if you ask most breastfeeding moms if it all just came easily, most will tell you it did not.

Tl;dr - Moms who breastfeed are badass bitches who deserve to say ""yeah, I did this...I persevered, and no, luck had nothing to do with it.""",unpopularopinion

From my perspective, Google is the least egregious offender of antitrust attitudes within the big tech circle. Here are 3 reasons to ponder:

1) Google makes a vast amount of open source tooling. Angular, Android, and Chromium are some of the biggests, but they really made corporate open-sourcing a norm. There is a reason why Samsung doesn't make phones with iOS. Additionally, Google Drive/Docs/Mail/Home have made otherwise costly services free.

2) Google is being penalized for preferring Google products and paying to be the homepage on certain devices, while companies like Apple force users to use their ecosystem. You can use other software concomitantly with Android, but not with Apple. Companies like AT&T force exclusivity agreements with things like apartment buildings and phones, and Apple music pays for exclusivity deals with artists.

3) Google has made life so. much. easier. I'm actually afraid this lawsuit will dramatically worsen my QOL (first-world problems).

4) Google is the only large tech company that I think we all have benefitted from. They anonymize advertising data, prioritize utility over income, and sponsor new technology. They also are largely responsible for the speed of internet (look at [web.dev](https://web.dev), Lighthouse, and Google Fonts).

Closing thought: The fact that Chrome managed to dethrone Internet Explorer and Safari, both of which shipped with operating systems, should indicate that Google's success has less to do with monopolistic tendencies and more to do with convenience. I also do not want to have to go back to Bing or Yahoo. Also, I apologize that this is poorly written... it is more stream-of-consciousness than essay.",unpopularopinion

Lithium is a finite resource, far rarer on a grand scale than oil ever was or will be, and takes comparatively more effort to extract and refine. At current capacity of electric or electric-assisted vehicles, and all the other things that require lithium for their batteries, we are already straining resources of available Lithium. Currently, electric and electric-assisted vehicles sit at only 5% of the global car market. Can you imagine the strain even a 10% share would put on Lithium resources?

Let me give you an example to illustrate my point. Jaguar, the british Automaker, released their Tesla Model Y competitor, the I-Pace in 2018. However, because Tesla had bought all the available Lithium for their batteries for that quarter, Jaguar had to wait for 3-4 months to acquire enough resources to make the batteries for the vehicles.

If delays like this are happening now, can you imagine what it will be like if Electric vehicles powered by Lithium batteries continue to increase? Long story short, it won't be good for manufacturer or customer, or Planet Earth for that matter.",unpopularopinion

I get that it's not always a genuine anger that they weren't backed up and that it's just playful, but regardless it's still rooted in a very naive attitude imo.

Edit to add that I'm not saying you should call them out in a way that chastises them, but to say something along the lines of ""I don't agree with that"" and explain why. Just because you're in a relationship doesn't mean you can't still have a mature discussion and disagree, we're all human (read: fallible) and should treat each other accordingly, regardless of the relationship you have.",unpopularopinion

Almost all others I know like to get their work done relatively quickly however I find doing any school work at the last minute much more easy. The energy rush I get when I see a ticking clock that has winded down to the very last hours or so (depending on what you have to do) is unexplainable. I seem to have this incoherent rush of creativeness when I am doing school work last minute. Not to mention how great it feels when you’ve been doing work for hours on end, it’s the middle of the night, and you’re finally done. It’s a superior way of doing school work.

"It’s not you can’t be yourself. Sometimes society, people and your surroundings exempt you from being what you are.",18,jf4aud,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/jf4aud/its_not_you_cant_be_yourself_sometimes_society/,4,2020-10-21 10:23:29,"Being yourself is just not easy anymore. Everyone keep judging so continually that it’s hard to realize oneself. Truth is we all  are searching to find our true selves and it’s an endless process that might never be fulfilled. People continually change so it’s hard to say one has found themself but it’s never too late to try. 

However, there are so many people who keep coming against the path you choose. Some are very horrendous and others are too simple. Each with their own paths to fulfill. Sometimes when you try to be yourself and get judged, called out or hated for it means your n being yourself. 

You can be wrong but you can improve but for that you got to realize your own mistake and for that you have to make the mistake instead of having a one way thought about it.

Being called out for being yourself can just be so unreliable to oneself. At times, you pretend to be someone and fake the one you really are. People tend to like you for that. So once the real you is out people tend to see you differently.

Why is that?...is in not because we are scared to implode what we truly are. How different we are from the society. If moving forward by being yourself was so difficult would any soul like to make a change for the better? I doubt it.

It’s hard to move forward when the worlds against you. But going forward is all you have to live for.",unpopularopinion

I can name a few whose entire career is dedicated to telling edgy and dark jokes. Shit, it's not hard to find comedians joking about raping children and beating their wives and their careers only expand.

I think this ""cancel culture is stifling humor"" is really ""Celebrities who don't like being held accountable for their actions, and instead try and hide behind their work.

Louis CK had nasty jokes all the time. I loved the guy. Never canceled until he pulled his dick out. No where near the stage did his career get canceled.

Ellen didn't tell dark jokes. But she sure as fuck was canceled for shit she did when she wasn't telling jokes to fans.

Roseanne Barr. I watched the shit out of Roseanne when I was a children. She was constantly threatened by censors for jokes she made on the show back in the day. Because back then, comedians were actually canceled for their jokes. 

Was she canceled by censors for making jokes on her show? No. She was cancelled for racist shit on Twitter.

Chris D’Elia made quite a few edgy jokes. Finally someone canceled for jokes.

Wait, no. He was canceled for grooming teenaged girls on social media. I don't know if you guys read the messages, but homie wasn't funny at all. 

Guys, don't fall for these scumbags bait. All of these celebrities, besides Ellen, I was a fan of too. I hate that I they ruined their careers and I won't get to see new material. If you're a UFC fan, it's similar to Jon Jones. Excellent fighter. Love to watch him work in the ring. Regrettable he makes it impossible by being a constant piece of shit.

Before anyone has their pitchforks ready to call me certain trope words, just want to say that I believe this applies to both genders, and any orientation.

It might matter if you're trying to cultivate relationships and emotional connections, but even then it's the bare minimum (though I don't think anyone argues that).

But for sex? It's not even a requirement. Tact is, and that's it. Obviously physical aspects help as well, but I'm referring to personality aspects. If human decency is there then great, but it won't make any difference if, say, you're hooking up with someone from a bar or party or on tinder. They're not gonna care what your favorite book is, what your politics are, what you're like in general - just that you have them and charmed their attention in that moment and whether they want to rip your clothes off.

Honestly I feel like it's because of this misconception that the ""Niceguy/nicegirl"" trope exists - obviously they suck if they think they're owed something - but I'm more talking about them genuinely being naive and not understanding why their approach fails (which, I don't think is the same as 'thinking you're owed' anything).

Of course it's weird for grown adults to not know, but young inexperienced teenagers/early 20s kids who don't know any better, they are never really taught about 'tact' - they just probably have been spoon-fed cliche platitudes or probably watched a lot of rom-coms and that's literally all they have to go on.

Then there's people who are the I-word (which I'm not sure I can say in case it gets this post filtered), all sorts of things can be said about them but the difference is that they say it affects it inversely which is bullshit.

Saying things like “the things that school teaches you are useless” is kind of misguided,47,jf3vrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/jf3vrl/saying_things_like_the_things_that_school_teaches/,9,2020-10-21 09:57:45,"I will start off by saying that yes, for the average person, Things like calculus and analyzing literature may be less useful than, say, learning to do taxes (In the age of the internet there are plants of ways to learn, but that’s a separate issue). The way i see it, school is a way to broaden your horizons. If you only ever learned basic math and language skills, then how would you know if you wanted to be a physicist because you enjoy calculus or a historian because you enjoy analyzing literature and learning about the past. Starting in high school, school becomes less about what you need to know and more about expanding your horizons and seeing what you want to do when you grow up. Now, i’m not saying that they shouldn’t teach kids how to balance a checkbook or calculate your taxes, because that should still be taught. All i’m saying is that it makes sense why schools teach us things that someone working a 9-5 selling cable tv would not necessarily need to know, because they want their kids to go on to better things.
