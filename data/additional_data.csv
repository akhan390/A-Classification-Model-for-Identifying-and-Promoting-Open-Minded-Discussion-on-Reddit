one example of this would be apple which treats workers so badly that they install nets that prevent suicide instead of actually improving conditions would avoiding iphones help them at all think if these companies were boycotted on a large scale of course that could be effective at waking them up they wouldnt want to lose money  but what can an individual do that might actually be beneficial  dont know much about economics or how many of these industries work im looking forward to responses that change my view"

 from reddits wishy washyness when they do settle on anything for a while its almost always a very liberal movement for example reddit clearly pushes the blm ideology along but none of the videos of protestors being brutally and inhumanely beating or otherwise injured by police make it to the popular section of reddit are countless examples of this but my point is reddit isnt far left its barely left and its just liberal you cant find a single leftist post on the popular page if you checked everyday for years"

 think ideologues and ideologies can be a problem in our society   define ideologue as someone possessed by a caricature of an idea 
an idea that can or cannot create a greater good for mankind 
it might be a benefit right now for them or they might think so 
it’s too simplified in most people’s head though and doesn’t necessarily have a practical application that can be easily demonstrated  ideology for me is an idea that is not necessarily correct sometimes because people haven’t agreed on what it means to them or they don’t understand what it means and use it anyway  a simplification of a truth or a reality that can seem right and correct and sometimes can be useful temporarily or as an aim but is more of a shortcut belief with a logicalreasoning gap somewhere  exemple in the way the “inequality” is framed  don’t think there are any doubts that equality is important it can be improved generation after generations over and over equality is an idea that can generate a greater good  the framing can influence the response how do we improve equality how do we achieve equality those questions will lead to possible framing gender race wealth competence iq beauty knowledge kindness etc can be frames that are used to see where is equality not attained not present or not present enough  am not sure the mainstream media is doing a fair presentation of how to work on equality  think that some ideologue or ideologies or groups with ideologies specially on the extreme right and extent left are spitting out what they think the solution is sometimes without listening to the other side  would love to think that there are greaterhigher  roads taken i do believe cmv is actually part of the solution here  think some ideologies and ideologues are having reasonable conversations  other are being unreasonable and too logical"

1,948,6851,116,0.0603448275862069,"cmv to fix american politics congress should be supplemented with election by lottery of normal american citizens people around the world complain that politicians do not represent them and that politicians are corrupt however political scientists have been rediscovering and developing an ancient democratic technique called sortition  basis behind sortition is simple you choose your leaders using random selection in the case of constructing a legislature you randomly select around 100 to 1000 citizens service is paid but voluntary using sortition you can construct citizen assemblies to do the legislative or decision making work i am extremely attracted to citizen asssemblies for a variety of reasons representation

i am extremely attracted to these sorts of citizens assembly after doing research on a variety of voting methods such as proportional representation using stv or party list unfortunately it seems to me that all proportional representative  pr methods are deficient in one way or another and do not seem to construct a representative cross section of the people people around the world complain about the corruption of government including countries that practice proportional representation pr methods produce apartheid states like israel or elect tyrants like erdogan  is the ideal proportionally representative cross section well from a statistical or scientific view the way to construct a representative sample is to draw a random sample so the ideal way to construct proportionally representative legislatures must be through random selection 
 of work

citizen assemblies are not a showerthought of mine but have been empirically studied by people such as james fishkin citizen assemblies use a process of deliberative democracy to arrive at conclusions citizen assemblies have been constructed throughout the world including america canada france ireland belgium mongolia tanzania china etc an important component of these studies is to observe what quality of work is output from these assemblies indeed researchers observe that after deliberation the assembly is capable of changing their mind and reaching new conclusions work by the citizens assembly was for example instrumental in the legalization of abortion and gay marriage in ireland
assemblies in ireland france and uk have urged their countries to implement carbon taxes advocate for fossil fuel regulations and become a leader in climate change mitigation i think its apparent that citizen assemblies almost always make superior decisions compared to the comparatively ignorant general voting population  of the status quo

democracy is under attack all around the world and in my opinion for good reason modernity has exposed the deficiencies of modern electoral democracy our elected leaders are oftentimes too afraid to act for fear of losing the next election our voters are ignorant rationally ignorant and vote ignorantly the work of evaluating politicians  policy is incredibly difficult and the news in my opinion does a mediocre job evaluating our politicians 
 remedies

most people believe the government to be corrupt and captured by the powerful and wealthy elite all of this unfortunately was predicted thousands of years ago by ancient greek philosophers aristotle for example understood electoral politics to be aristocratic in its nature as even 2400 years ago elections tended to elect the rich and powerful in contrast athens used what aristotle called radical democracy a system to rule and be ruled in turn it was this radical democracy that guaranteed the rights of all and folks like plato and aristotle thought these radical democrats overemphasized freedom and rights contrary to popular belief athens was not run through a purely direct democracy system instead it was a combination of direct democracy and sortition with checks and balances  had its own problems particularly with mediocre decisions made by the people which i personally blame on the time and technological limitations they used to make their decisions in the most famous example the athenian people executed their entire navy leadership after the generals won a critical sea battle but failed to pick up survivors during a storm after the execution the people came to immediately regret their decision and therefore decided to execute the guy who made the first proposal and with these disasters reforms came to temper the passions of the crowd with additional check and balances moreover the athenians did not seem to use modern deliberative methods to arrive at their conclusions instead debates were perform in enormous crowds of around 5000 people  despite these drawbacks there were also advantages political parties and factions did not form in these semidirect sortition based democracies indirect lobbying also did not seem to be prevalent in the best documented case the silver mining business lobbied the athenian democracy yet the democracy rejected their proposals in direct democracy parties do not need to form in order to concentrate power concentrated power which is needed to win elections without elections there is no need for the people to create party factions and develop electoral strategies  to implement sortition

exactly how would sortition work in modern times well for example sortition could be used to completely replace say the us senate and join the us house as a bicameral legislature critics of sortition have noted the potential for elite capture of randomly selected citizens and the potential for corruption therefore i think its apt to retain some electoral democracy as as check an balance i have also heard claims that a purely sortitionbased system is prone to violent revolution as the elites need some sort of competitive safety valve to pour their energy towards  citizen assemblies could be used to review referendum choices called citizen initiative reviews or citizen assemblies could be used as an electoral college to choose the president  a mind

this is what i believe is the best possible proposal we need to fix our democracy but if you can think of a better reform i want to hear it"

 we are animals and we arent really to blame for anything we do what we do is determined by our brains which we didnt create or choose we dont really have free will thats why it makes no sense to judge someone for the things they do   
 youre gonna say so we should just let criminals walk free no of course not   
 should see punishment as a measure that seeks to improve our society it serves as a deterrent for crime and also seeks to rehabilitate criminals so they become better people outside   
we should look at it the same way  we look at punishment for our own children we dont punish them as retribution but to make them better people   
 concept of justice is outdated and is based on borderline supernatural principles it makes no sense objectively that we need to restore a balance after someone did something bad objectively the only reaction we should have is try to not let that happen again   
 creates unnecessary tension and contributes to harmful ideologies and conflicts we need to become more objecitve as people and not let us be driven by irrational emotion"

companies like tesla gm and ford all use the term its become universal in automotive industry marketing little do these companies do to mention that the production of a large lithiumion battery requires an incredible bit of energy for example the production of a lithiumion light electric vehicle battery releases nearly 200 kilos of co2 per kwh battery the tesla model 3 contains at the minimum a 54 kwh battery resulting in the emission of 810 tons of co2 just from production comparison epagov states that a typical gaspowered passenger vehicle achieving 22mpg produces approximately 46 metric tons of co2 per year yes this is obviously a lot more than electric but thats not the point here dont forget that the electricity to charge the car has to be generated from somewhere and this is often via excessive carbonemitting processes and the united states still generates 80 of its energy from fossil fuels while more environmentally friendly than gaspowered vehicles electric vehicles still produce a crap ton of co2 and it is very misleading to say that are zero emission"

i disagree for the following reasons this is lowering the bar this is often what lies at the heart of antiracism an indirect admission that they believe these ethnic groups are unable to perform at the same level as their peers instead of placing the responsibility on the individualsgroups they simply create conditions in which students cannot fail 
 there is absolutely nothing racecentric regarding attendance cheating and latework calling disparities in these outcomes racist is disingenuous because it implies certain ethnic groups are being targeted and intentionally failed it is artificial victimhood the operates under the idea that any disparity in performance must be attributed to racism or targeted harm and rejects individual responsibility nothing about this is antiracist

 noticed that many people seem to innately assume that unborn children are a highly valuable commodity which confuses me as any of 24 billion women could essentially produce billions more embryos at any given time while a specific embryo or fetus can absolutely hold subjective value to a person which is why i support laws that punish the murder of a pregnant person as though it was a double homicide i dont see the issue with a person choosing to rid themselves of an unwanted pregnancy nothing of inherent or subjective value was lost while im not a fan of abortions used as matter of convenience id much prefer universal healthcare and a robust sex ed curriculum i see an abortion as nothing more than a medical procedure with no morality involved any more than a kidney transplant is moral

2 it can in fact enhance the source material to give it greater nuance or exploration of ideas by changing up relationships between the characters and increasing the depth of the storytelling not talking about characters where the performer was a different gender but the role wasnt rewritten in any way or the story altered or roles where gender is immaterial an example of this is ellen ripley from alien  the script famously had no genders assigned to the roles or the ancient one from doctor strange where there is literally nothing to the fact that the ancient one is a celtic woman instead of a chinese man other than the introduction gag of the examples that i am thinking of recently where i feel this was particularly successful country  by creating christina as the daughter instead of caleb the son it set up the theme from the very beginning of a woman struggling to seize her familys legacy of magic which had been denied to her because of her gender and then the relationship with ruby that takes on a theme of identity with how she always has relations in williams form until the very end boys  stormfront is a relatively generic thor facsimile in the comics but with a female playing the role they were able to make subverting the theme of girl power a noteworthy point come up with a far more interesting back story give a little more depth to the idea of supplanting ryans mother and set up a great plotline with the romance with homelander which will help propel him further towards his breaking point in the coming seasons in space  from a practical standpoint any male actor would immediately be compared to jonathan harris iconic performance as dr smith but it goes beyond that to set up a completely different type of malevolent manipulation said there are an awful lot of people who decried these castingplot choices so change my mind  why is it better  more important to stick exactly to the source material than do this adding one small caveat that i forgot to mention previously  this would only really apply in cases where the characters gender didnt specifically have a core concept in the plot of the original like for example gi jane where the entire crux of the story was about a woman training to be a navy seal but as a counterexample maybe an updated retelling of the three musketeers where one of them is a woman and it plays with the theme of how a woman would fit into that sort of all for one one for all brotherhood "

the islamic extremists in france have caused massive loss and bloodshed just like how hirohitos japan attacked pearl harbor and the western coast of the united states both incidents are awful and those responsible deserved to face the consequences
    
that being said after both incidents the victim nation immediately turned on the ethnicity or religion of the attackers america put asians into concentration camps and france has proposed doing the same to muslims such a plan is very similar to what china has done to international backlash
    
after the recent beheading ive seen a lot of very xenophobic and concerning remarks on reddit and social media people have been making vast generalisations about modern muslims and aggressive statements about what they think of them
    
this is like hating all africans for theft hating all mexicans for drugs and hating all arabs for terrorism blame the racereligionsex is a hateful mindset that has infiltrated the united states and is slowly seeping into europe
    
when repeatedly wronged by members of a racereligionsex many people tend to blame the group the perpetrator comes from the conclusion may seem logical at first as it follows the trend but correlation does not equal causation
    
i have met plenty of muslims and none have been aggressive angry or supportive of terrorism one even specifically condemned terrorism and said that they do not associate with extremists
    
unlike america france has yet to take the plunge and turn to fullscale racism nonetheless such sentiment appears to be growing and it could spiral out of control
    
it would not surprise me if muslims and even arabs in general become targets of abuse and hate in europe as that is exactly what happened in america post911"

 reason 1 its all voluntary transactions no one forces you to take internships ones stopping you from applying for paid internships and if the only internships you can find are unpaid then the cold hard truth is you dont deserve to be paid 2 companies need to invest in interns to gain some value back and they can only afford to pay interns if they get more than what they invest in addition its also about a companys profitability very often in order for the company to get some value of out their interns even low skill jobs like flipping burgers they need to put in a lot of trainings  to no surprise this incurs costs to the employers and even after training interns are very likely to mess up due to their inexperience which is fine and cleaning it up also incurs cost math pay  value added by the employee  money invested by the employer x some factors why sometimes you even see interns have to pay the company they work for in order to get an internship and that brings us to reason  and  3 its all supply and demand unpaid internships illegal is not necessary if an employer benefits from an internship they can still afford to raise the pay from 0 to x lets say if an intern can add 100 to the business then the maximum the business can pay is 99 and they will use salary as a way to keep bidding for interns as long as theyre profitable vice versa unpaid internships are so common is because the supply of littletozerovalueadding interns are so big they companies dont have to bid against each other the way this applies to every kind of job in the world you see google pays crazy money to their employees as they are so profitable that they can outbid every other business in the world and they can keep doing so no ones forcing them to generously pay their employees 4 inexperienced people benefit from unpaid internships and mediumsized employers are more encouraged to hire interns if they dont have to pay which opens up more opportunities for young and inexperience people to get their first step into the workplace gain experience and prove that they can deliver something of it as free trials are more willing to try out a product if you have nothing to lose the product manufacturer can get feedback on their product and improve potentially have you as their customer are more willing to give inexperience people an internship if they dont have to pay the intern can get feedback on their performance and improve potentially land a job afterwards"

edit if you downvote because you disagree isnt the whole point of this sub to try to convince me of your point of view disagreeing is only the first part of the argument and its also the part thats easiest to do and the part that has no substance if you stop there then it kinda makes the argument pretty weak doesnt it i dont mind the downvote but if you cant provide a reasoning to your disagreement youre essentially admitting that you cant argue and your opinion shouldnt matter as you have no reasoning to back up your opinion    
edit i really dont think you guys read the post im not arguing that barristan wasnt a hero im not arguing that dd sucks at writing im not arguing that barristans post death was handled badly im not arguing that barristans dead in the book im not arguing that barristan doesnt deserve a better death im arguing that barristans death is fine in the context of got and that is not everything goes as planned and characters die left and right and are not immune any of you that read the old superhero comics will know that superheroes are pretty immune they always fly with a smile and beat the shit out of any villains this is also a prominent theme in mainstream media because the good guy always has to win when i point out unexpected it means different from my expectations you all want to watch a movie where everything goes to your expectations thats fine your time your money for me thats boring if everything goes the way i expect it to go why would i watch the movie i already know the ending barristan dying in the alleyway and the manner in which he died is not what i expected yet it goes perfectly with the fact that no got character no matter how powerful they are is safe aside from a few good points im extremely disappointed in the majority of comments which seem more directed to making fun of my grammar than making arguments a bunch of you actually inadvertently proved my point i choose not to correct you out of respect and to preserve your dignity others cant seem to read properly and repeatedly focus on points i havent made then get upset when i correct them i am extremely disappointed in the quality of comments and the quality of analysis i think ill stick to science questions with definite answers since science question requires less reading comprehension the fact that many are calling out my grammar proves that you have no points to argue youre so desperate to sound smart that youve decided to point out something that you can find a flaw in which again is not related to the topic at hand if this is how you handle discussion i feel sorry for you you must have never convinced anyone of anything if ive ignored you its because youre either a troll and you dont deserve any attention or youve just proved my point and no further discussion is needed it might take some time for you to realize it but you dont need to thank me when you do"

1,922,5589,299,0.020066889632107024,cmvprovided the government in question is democratic sayings like socialism is when the government does stuff and the more stuff the government does the socialister it is are unironically true and leftists who mockingly say things like this to clown on nonleftists are showing their ignorance background richard wolff a leftist professor has a semiviral clip where he jokingly talks about what socialism is  the joke being that uninformed liberals centrists and conservatives dont know what real socialism is this has become a bit of an in joke among leftists  i think the statement is actually correct on an orthodox understanding of what socialism is the means of production being controlled socially provided that the government in question is democratic it seems to me that a government being big and doing stuff like levying taxes to provide services or regulating businesses to prevent them from doing things it doesnt want is a pretty clear case of there being collective social control over the means of production every time the government  which in a democracy is just serving as an avatar of the people  makes a law about what businesses are and arent allowed to do or every time they take a tax they are directly controlling what the means of production are doing and where the wealth created with them goes ergo its socialist dont really see a meaningful difference between a situation that is unambiguously socialist  such as the government creating a publicly owned firm for example in scandinavia their aluminum mills are all socialized and normal government services like the post office or the tva or something if the distinction is just minutiae like the government owned enterprises have corporate officers while normal government agencies just have appointed heads that seems like a pretty weak distinction to me the forest service and bureau of land management are just reits that the government owns amtrack is just a public railway company the usps is just socialized fedex etc if a government owned reit is socialist then so is the forest service also dont really see a meaningful difference between on the one hand the public regulating and taxing a firm whereby they get some of the wealth that the firm makes in taxes and gets to control what the firm does through regulation and on the other hand just owning a piece of the fund in a social wealth fund where the public gets some of the wealth through dividends and exerts some control over the firms behavior through shareholder voting seems like the main distinction is formal ownership but legal ownership is actually a somewhat loose concept that means different things in different countries and time periods my lawyer friend likes to tell me that property is a bundle of sticks  there isnt a precise legal definition for relationships like person a owns b housefactoryfirm etc ways to change my view  obviously not exhaustive if theres a better argument ill do my best to consider it there are in fact robust ontological differences between things like gses sovereign wealth funds etc and the government just regulating and taxing firms and then using that to provide services sovereign wealth funds and gsessoes are not in fact socialist so comparing them to taxes and regulations is beside the point ive met some socialists who are convinced that something is only really socialist if the collectivization is at the firm rather than state level sometimes people will throw around the word state capitalism  but idk really what to do with that but ive never really understood this line of reason in my experience they get very handwavy and i lose interest but im willing to entertain this line of reasoning if someone can explain and defend it clearly ive also met some socialists who believe that the collectivized pieces of a mixed economy are not in fact socialist that socialism is rather an allornothing proposition i think this is sort of dumb as it would mean that as long as theres some granny in the mountains renting out her sewing machine for a profit a country can never be truly socialist no matter how collectivized everything else in the country is whether theres a robust ontological difference between sovereign wealth funds is beside the point for some other reason the one you just gotta read more theory socialist i know in real life will say things that i dont really get about how socialism vs not socialism should really be decided by the method that its brought about as opposed to what it actually is  i dont really get what hes saying and hes kinda out there on a lot of topics but hes kind of smart so maybe if someone can explain what this line of reasoning is all about id change my view i want this view changed im generally pretty anticapitalismcurious  i would probably call myself  a social democrat or something but i get annoyed with how arrogant a lot of leftists are about reading theory and having talmudic disputes about the finer points of leftist ontology its doubly annoying when someone is arrogant and wrong at the same time which is what i think is happening when people say things along the lines of socialism is when government does stuff to mock people id like to change this view because if im wrong about this i can stop being doubly annoyed by people who i might otherwise learn from i do not believe that there is a robust difference between the government being big and doing stuff and unambiguously socialist things like gses and sovereign wealth funds so it doesnt make sense to say that the latter is socialist but the former is not

1,991,5936,141,0.028368794326241134,cmv democracies should be striving towards a system where citizens can influence policy decisions by voting on important issues in realtime in case my idea doesn’t come across clearly from the title i’m talking about a technological solution smartphone app for example where members of society can provide their thoughts on political issues and this data is used to influence government decisionmaking similar to the yougov polling app except more comprehensive and a lot more transparent around how the data is used to form key policy decisions in realtime essentially i’m advocating mini referendums for all manner of issues and the technology should also be used to hold elections as well  talk in context of the uk as that’s where i’m from i’ll admit straight away that i’m not fully aware of the mechanisms and internal workings of government for example exactly how laws are drafted reviewed debated and passed into legislature however for me that doesn’t detract from or invalidate my idea i just represent the common person in the street who is equally ignorant  idea is essentially about modernising how democracy works in the uk mps members of parliament are elected to represent the interests of a certain geographical area the mps from different areas meet to shape and debate policy decisions which are then voted on by parliament and by lords unelected officials this may have worked brilliantly when the country’s population was lower and the elected officials were actually integral members of their local community people who knew the hopes and dreams and fears and concerns of their electorate people who knew exactly how the ordinary man was faring in daytoday life and how they would benefit from government intervention nowadays though it would appear there’s more of a disconnect between voters and politicians who it’s often commented “don’t live in the same world” how can an mp claim to represent their constituents when they would probably struggle to name even fifty of them in some cases mps don’t even reside in the area they represent in my area for example i only ever hear from my mp when it’s local election time and they shove a letter through the door basically begging that i vote for them i understand i can write to my mp about specific issues and petition them via dropin “clinics” which are held every now and then but again this feels archaic and realistically who has time for this now in today’s world how would my idea work i think there should be a smartphone app which every citizen has an account for when important issues arise every account should be notified and the user logs in to read impartial analysis on the topic and then has one vote on the outcome they would like to see i’m imagining radio buttons with different options spelled out potentially with further child questions to further clarify their stance the user then submits their vote on how the uk tackles this issue after a fixed time period results are published to the app and they should be binding a democratic government should follow the wishes of it’s citizens  would operate much the same way available partiespoliticians would each have a biography and manifesto available in the app with a handy little sidebyside comparison table for users to summarise and compare stances on important issues the user then submits their vote via their phone  give a quick example that’s commonly reported on in the popular media immigration the app would start with a headline question “should the uk provide residence andor citizenship to any foreign nationals” depending on the answer given there’d then be a series of followup questions under what circumstances economic migrants refugees how many should family units ever be broken up what support should be given to set them up for life in the uk etc etc like i say each question would come with analysis and an explanation of the possible answers  think this system would be vastly superior to the current political process and would make it much easier for voters to engage in politics it would give society assurance that their views are being considered and their lives aren’t just being decisioned by a small group of individuals they can’t relate to and will never ever meet as this is cmv though i’m fully open to debate on this and welcome your counterarguments  try and preempt some of the challenges i foresee  the technology doesn’t exist there are security concerns around data and anonymity and it could easily be manipulated by nefarious individualsorganisationsforeign governmentsetc i know my view is that we should be aiming for this not that we should implement it today not everyone has a smartphone or is au fait with them well not everyone bothers to engage in politics now anyway and it wouldn’t really be all that expensive to roll out governmentissued devices to those without if we did want to make it accessible to all some people won’t take the time to understand the issues being debated and won’t understand the implications of their vote i totally agree with this one but for me that’s the beauty of a democracy government should represent who society actually is not some romanticised “better” for want of a better word version of who it’s citizens ”should” be go back to the migrant example if for example it turns out that a lot of people don’t want to bother understanding the issue and just say “yes to skilled workers we need in order to fill workforce gaps” and “no to everyone else” you could make a strong argument this is very bigoted then as unpalatable as that might be sorry but that is what society actually wants and as a democratic government it’s your job to represent the wishes of your people this all feels very “black mirror” i see where you’re coming from but i still think it would be progress and deliver a better outcome on the whole  for reading

 i think that college was a little too late to even have a class like that and i had wished that through elementary school middle school and high school that i had been continuously exposed to this so i can keep my mental swords sharp
 see way too many people nowadays believing in the first things that they see without evaluating whether it is actually true or an acceptable argument or whatnot and i really cannot think of a downside to having this as a class taught at every level of public education

 it seems like a lot of people are commenting about the dissatisfaction of debating classes i’ve never taken a debate class so i don’t know what it entails but i just thought about it as in the realm of not speech and debate  competitive debating but rather just how to effectively argue with someone and learning about things like the code of intellectual conduct lots of good discussion though surprised this got so much traction"

 as consumers we can influence those choices by not buying the latest title or stop playing a certain game thus our voice could get heard
 
 clearly the majority of people who buys games nowadays don’t care enough and this is the simple reason why companies like ea activion and such should and rightfully make this moves 

 if your company is making less money than the precedent year your at a loss and management sees it as a red flag for this reason they push to surpass the number achieved the year before and we can’t change that

 the only way to change those conducts is trying to raise awareness and not supporting franchises like fifa or 2k

 running a company is about making more money than the previous year most people keep buying games regardless ads and microtransaction so complaining without taking actions is useless
 my point is that companies should keep doing this until the majority of customers turn against it because money is the point of starting a company hopefully this clarify my post a bit "

 someone makes a statement and you care about the factuality of the statement then you carry that burden by way of caring about the subject while its great if someone gives citation to help you cannot force them why should you believe an assertion without evidence you shouldnt but likewise if you care about having justified beliefs you cannot reject the assertion without evidence  
 you still think a burden exists please explain from when that burden springs what obligates a person to another

 true the pictures are nice and cute but behind the charm theres a measure of casual sadism that i simply cant take no im not new to cruel fairy tales and i think that children should get some of the details from say brothers grimm when they are ready  but the animals of beatrix potter are seemingly cruel for the sake of being cruel or assholes for no good reason nutkin is nearly skinned for being an asshole  with the other squirrels maintaining their silence i dont even want to question the ethics of sentient squirrels killing sentient mice and sentient moles to satisfy a sentient owl for some nut harvest tiptoes is beaten halfdead and left to die in an empty stump by other squirrels where he is rescued by a chipmunk who left his wife just because and he doesnt return to her for a while tom kitten and his brothers are robbed well just because 

 whats more this is not the casual sadism of classic fairy tales  this is a very welldeveloped sadism of modern literature explained in detail on many pages it takes six pages to early bake tom kitten into a pie with a description befitting the library policeman by steven king theres a whole book on how a sentient frog slowly devours sentient bees in the house of a sentient mouse for christs sake and no theres no greater moral here hidden anywhere  this is literally the whole story with the mouse cleaning up afterwards and inviting other mice as if nothing happened its hardly alone  theres a story of how a frog nearly died during fishing a story of how the rabbit was nearly killed by a farmer and a story of how baby bunnies were nearly killed  all without any single moral its not like something embedded in a bigger fairy tale  it was just the literary equivalent of a gory video where the outcome seemingly was irrelevant to the detailed description of suffering over many pages

we frequently hear about how the rich are getting richer at the expense of the poor how rich people are jerks or sociopaths and thats what made them successful how some company lied through their teeth and broke a dozen laws to make a ton of money and then didnt get penalized for it how people with power are becoming physically abusive to those without it or how corrupt businesses and politics in general can be

these things are constantly in the news and people wonder why the little guy cant catch a break we try to be good people we work hard and do our best and yet somehow it feels like we always get the bad end of the deal

while good and bad are open to individual interpretation people who adhere to the personality traits that we were told to embody as children are usually seen as good people but instead of being rewarded for it theyre often punished for it

1 be kind  get walked on used  abused  if you stand up for yourself youre seen as being mean

2 have a positive attitude and only say positive things  dont stand up for yourself or address a problem even if presenting a solution negativity is unattractive see  and people dont like problems or messengers instead just ignore them and hope that they go away even though they wont and will only continue to get worse over time

3 be a hard worker and have a good work ethic  pick up the slack and extra work for all of your coworkers and boss without any sort of thanks or compensation you dont like that refer to 

4 be good at what you do  there are lots of people who are good at what you do so spend all of your time even personal time trying to be even better than all of them you wont be compensated for it but refer to  and  and never forget  there are a million people who can take your place and your company is willing to pay your replacement even if they wont pay you

5 do a lot of things     x  number of roles and all so that no one has any idea what you actually do so youll be phased out

6 be a team player  let your bosses walk all over you and your coworkers take credit for your work

7 respect your elders  do what youre told without thinking so that they can yell at you for having a mind of your own and for not thinking for yourself and let them abuse you in general because theyve earned it by putting up with other people doing this to them for longer than you have

8 listen to those who know more than you  this is entirely based on the perception of the person giving you this advice and therefore includes people who know nothing and lie to you constantly about their knowledge and of course question nothing at all because how much do you really know

9 trust others and give them the benefit of the doubt  they will betray you because they know that they can lie to you and youll believe them

10 tell the truth   so that people can possibly purposefully misinterpret and get offended by every miniscule thing that you say even if it is straight fact so you can be seen as unprofessional for not towing the company line and you can be fired for offending someone

11 dont lie cheat or steal  give everyone else an unfair advantage because youre better than them somehow by adhering to good behaviors that you are not in any way shape or form rewarded for

12 dont manipulate people  good luck finding a customerfacing job that pays a livable wage and definitely dont even think about standing up to your bosses or coworkers when theyre trying to manipulate you because theyll accuse you of manipulating them instead

13 be supportive and put others first  make everything about everyone else and ignore your own needs hopefully if you only focus on them theyll like you and maybe one day they might care about something that you need maybe

theres a reason that people say nice guys finish last you dont have to be a bad person to succeed in life but being a good person makes it significantly harder if not almost impossible unless your personal definition of success is simply to be a good person

thats not to say that we shouldnt teach our children to embody these traits but we should start rewarding people for these traits instead of manipulating and abusing them and throwing all of our opportunities and money at fads and people who are already successful

if the good people dont stand up for other good people who will"

  my grandma grows tomatoes in her own garden nothing too big just enough to give the whole family one or two small crates those are some of the best tomatoes i have ever eaten theyre bulky and red and very misshaped but the flavour is like nothing youve ever tasted after they were harvested we would sit and just eat tomatoes whit cow chees look it up its also really tasty from her own cow we would just bite into one while harvesting real tomatoes are great you just need to know which ones are good

  it could just be a taste i associated with childhood and with the summers i used to spend at my grandparents house but i can very well tell the difference between a store bought one and one from the farmers market

  i admit i also dont like the ones you find in burgers and those in similar foods but that doesnt mean i dont like tomatoes it just means i dont like bad tasteless tomatoes you wouldnt go get a haircut and after getting a bad one say you dont like hair so why do tomatoes get such a bad rep 

  now i understand that there are people that just dont like the actual tomato taste and im fine with that  if youve tried real tomatoes and dont like them thats fine but i think most people grew a dislike for the fakes and arent willing to try good ones anymore because of a bad experience they already have so please if you can find a red firm and fresh tomato give it a try you might find that you dont hate them"

 if youre not that great at spelling you dont have to feel bad about it anymore 
 the ability to spell the standard way is a marker of social class  but it doesnt have to again not sure how youd enforce that change this all just a thought experiment accents are also a class marker but you dont often get interrupted midsentence if you prononce a word with a strong burr or a twang but you do get nasty comments online if you happen to misuse youre even though thats beside the point and also pretty dickish
 so much variety  debunking why you might think this is a terrible idea understandably messy spelling is harder to read true but only because were not used to it other accents are harder to understand when were not used to hearing them until we learn to id go as far as saying that standard spelling prevents us from learning how to read each others unique idiolects 
 messy spelling will hurt our ability to think and speak clearly thats a common misconception writing doesnt precede speech its just a way of marking it down research doesnt show that bad spellers are inherently less articulate than good spellers
 does that mean we can spell everything anyway we want to like that fishghoti thing well yes i suppose so but the point is to write in a way thats comfortable to you and actively obscuring what youre trying to say is not a good strategy to achieve that back to the accent metaphor again just because you can speak without getting insulted for your native accent doesnt mean its a good idea to speak random rubbish that even you cant understand 
 what about sentences where spelling is the only way of knowing what youre supposed to understand well truly ambiguous situations are fairly rare because usually context clarifies everything otherwise you wouldnt be able to understand the difference between say their cats and theyre cats even in oral speech  discuss   please do point out spelling mistakes i might have made while writing this post i shall enjoy your comments like a warrior drinking the blood of their enemies"

0,987,5721,117,0.008547008547008548,raisins have more potential in food than chocolate the chocolate industry knows this and has actively covered it up raisins are a long debated subject some think raisins are delicious and a great way to imbed fruit into foods while others think the idea of them is bland and like grandma boring and wrinkled personally dont care about this argument as its been argued to death what i think is true is that raisins are an untapped gold mine for culinary lovers  and that the chocolate industry has created a cover up due to the cost of raisins think about it raisins are mostly found along side other expensive trail foods like nuts and breads because they offer sweetness without melting or overpowering the strong flavors of a mix or bread a perfect amount of sweet fruitiness in every bite anything that has raisins are expensive compared to chocolate and are generally when compared via 100g more expensive than whole milk chocolate now viewing this from a manufacturers point of view you have to see how raisins are usually used are commonly found in breads mixes soft cookies and yogurt parfait what do all of these have in common they are locally either expensive or hold almost no raisins compared to chocolate products of the same gram weight nut mixes a combo of the 2 they are expensive due to the nuts and hold little to no chocolate if raisins are found in the same mix because of the premium price you pay for said mix however take a look between oatmeal raisin cookies and chocolate cookies and there is a big difference between the 2 cookies are more common come with more cookies and keep longer than raisin cookies due to moister content and because crisp cookies with fruit generally arent as popular in the western world in canada and the united states crispy raisin cookies are strictly used as a dipping cookie in a hot drink where chocolate would melt they are also generally more expensive due to the finer ingredients needed to make them up to this standard  is the biggest problem raisins are simply not given the same love due to 1 important thing they need more ingredients to function in their role in a culinary perspective this is a good thing as the marry of flavor can have very good effects on texture flavor nutrition and presentation however to mass produce them would require more of those ingredients and the time to test them cost probably millions more than chocolate chocolate cookie can take 3 forms a sandwich cookie a crispy cookie and a soft cookie for the purpose of the argument we will ignore the sandwich cookie as really its own thing but for crispy and soft cookies using chocolate one thing is clear the ingredients are roughly the same as a basic chocolate cookie needs generally less expensive materials to make and can be toyed with to give different outcomes based on flour used raisin cookies on the other hand need stronger chewy materials to offset its chewy natural skin this generally means less product per harvest more time invested into the making of different cookies with the same ingredients and most importantly the cost of the more whole materials culmination is the direct result of the chocolate industry who know that they can make more money by selling cheap mass produced chocolate cookies than more expensive harder to make raisin cookies thats why you never see raisin cookies as a flag ship of a cookie brand  because the chocolate industry is cheaper to buy from and easier to make into the cheap lovable prepacked cookies in store amount of fruit that can give its flavor to a raisin can beat out chocolate ten fold because it is not limited to just one plant grapes cranberries huckleberries saskatoon berries if it its small and can be dried out you have a raisin not to mention the grape raisins change so much depending on what type of grape its dried from need a more wine like pop golden raisins a deep rich graph flavor black raisins so many different types while with our chocolate you get no coca butter some coca butter and mostly coca butter and other fillers breads cookies heck even tarts and pies all welcome the concentrated flavors of raisins to carry something that is savory to a sweet pedestal yet simply for the fact that they are not chocolate and more expensive they are second class dessert material never see raisin cookies been advertised or santa sitting down with raisin cookies and milk because the chocolate industry has covered it up and will trick you into thinking that those are not the cookies of a modern generation theyre for old people who have lost the taste of their youth or grandmas last ditch effort to the pot luck tea loafs and raisin bread will be treated as sweet treats but never desserts because chocolate cakes and cookies are the easy cheap way to bring the smell of baked goods to the dessert table butter tarts and pies with raisins will forever be seen as the grandma food of the after dinner potluck because chocolate brownies and puddings are youthful and rich raisins will never see the stockings of a loved one because if they arent cover in chocolate they are healthy and of bad taste and raisins will forever be tossed into the discarded trick or treat bowl because the chocolate covered sugar bars are just so much better deserve better they deserve our love our attention and our skills to create new desserts in the kitchen because of we allow raisins to spearhead our culinary desires we may one day finally treat them with the long aged respect they deserve in a world where fruit and dessert meet at a perfect crossroads while people sit eating chocolate and raisin cookies as equals deserve raisins and should be proud to stand with them

they contribute nothing to the flavor and actually knocks the cake eating experience down a peg but cooked raisins in anything is gross 😝 and to put them in carrot cake is flat out wrong what usually happens is the raisin gets partially rehydrated from the fluids in the batter and becomes a warm wrinkly semigrape that is more reminiscent of a normal grape that has begun to go bad than a sundried raisin in a baked good the chewing experience in this case is unbearable my opinion carrot cake would be 1010 if it werent for those dang raisins"

0,174,953,62,0.016129032258064516,i wish panhandlers begged for work instead of begging for cash im from new york city before the pandemic id come across a panhandler at least once a day on my daily commute throughout my 20 years in the city ive only seen in one case where a panhandler was begging for work instead of begging for straight cash  been lied to and swindled more times than i can remember some make up stories about being so hungry and when offered food instead of money they refuse it others make up a story of needing money for the train or bus and you see them at the exact same location tricking people the next day  understand some people under circumstances that prevent them from working but what i dont understand is why in my 20 years of seeing hundreds and hundreds of panhandlers many of which young and able bodies only 1 was ever begging for a job rather than for cash if you really wanted money wouldnt a regular job be substantially better than regularly nagging for a buck from a stranger

0,220,1185,88,0.011363636363636364,saying things like “the things that school teaches you are useless” is kind of misguided i will start off by saying that yes for the average person things like calculus and analyzing literature may be less useful than say learning to do taxes in the age of the internet there are plants of ways to learn but that’s a separate issue the way i see it school is a way to broaden your horizons if you only ever learned basic math and language skills then how would you know if you wanted to be a physicist because you enjoy calculus or a historian because you enjoy analyzing literature and learning about the past starting in high school school becomes less about what you need to know and more about expanding your horizons and seeing what you want to do when you grow up now i’m not saying that they shouldn’t teach kids how to balance a checkbook or calculate your taxes because that should still be taught all i’m saying is that it makes sense why schools teach us things that someone working a 95 selling cable tv would not necessarily need to know because they want their kids to go on to better things if they give us a path at a young age to learn good skills then we can become someone with a more sustainable job like an engineer or a scientist
