CMV: Mike Bloomberg's campaign is proof that the ultra wealthy in the US can afford a higher tax rate with no ill effect on them,65396,3812,2020-03-06 02:22:18,"Mike Bloomberg recently dropped out of the 2020 Presidential race after spending over $500 million dollars of his own money on his campaign. Even with this loss, he is still worth over $55 billion dollars.


I believe that this effortless spending on Bloombergs part showcases the reality that is wealth inequality between the ultra rich and working class. While I do not believe the rich should give up their fortunes, I do believe that any arguments against taxing them more is simply propaganda from those who hold the wealth and higher power at this point. 

Certain media outlets claim that taxing the super wealthy is unfair and would be detrimental to those below them due to ""trickle down"" effects. There is also rhetoric that many self made billionaires worked hard for their fortunes, and that if we as Americans work hard, we might be rich ourselves one day.

I believe that moving forward, we should push for much higher taxes on those earning/worth more than 1 billion USD. If the money Bloomberg spent on his campaign went to actual communities that need funding, actual change could have been possible. Social programs could benefit greatly from these funds, and maybe we could afford to better fund national programs such as healthcare or family leave.",1
CMV: Kanye West is a shill for president Trump and running to syphon off young voters from voting for Biden.,54138,2101,2020-07-06 00:25:43,"Kanye West is a shill for president Trump and running to syphon off young voters from voting for Biden. First, he may have an excentric take on reality but can't honestly believe that he has a chance of winning. Second, if he truly wanted to be president, he would have started his campaign last year when he still had a chance to get on state ballots. Third, he has been an avid defender of Trump and the MAGA agenda. Just from reviewing other threads on reddit, there are people willing to vote for him. Generally speaking, the fan base of artists like Kanye skews young and culturally diverse, which are both not likely to vote for Trump. 

There are plenty of other reasons you can say that Kanye is running, but unless you say how my view is flawed I will only consider those reasons as supplemental to the above concept and not as a replacement for.

CMV: Donald Trump has not made a single lasting positive impact on the USA during his term as president.,35185,5332,2020-09-10 22:11:37,"I write this because I am tired of the wild goose chase that is finding examples of his success. Anything surrounding Donald Trump is shrouded in divisive language and biased opinions. Liberals will have you believe he has done nothing, while conservatives will tout his unlimited success. I must be missing it, because any time I try to research into a topic I get lost in opinion and bias. 

I am completely willing to hear and review and accept any examples of success or lasting positive change that has come about as a direct result of Trumps presidency. In fact I want to! It can’t be ALL bad.

Edit1: a lot of responses here. I need to actually read the sources for the claims everyone’s making, so it may take a while for me to respond to each comment, but I will try. I’ll take this chance to remind everyone it’s possible to have civil discourse about even the most divisive topics, even the infamous DJT. Thanks all for the responses.

Edit2: double thanks to those who are responding and engaging one another civilly, and awarding the post. I think it’s important to realize how biased we can become despite the facts. The good things don’t necessarily outweigh the bad, so maybe there’s a counter-post to be made regarding all of the harm DJT has done as well. Every point has a counter point, so take anything you hear with the ole’ grain of salt. I urge everyone to educate themselves and vote in the upcoming election for the candidate they believe in - and don’t let politics negatively impact your happiness. It’s just like any other thing, and can be harmful in high doses.

Edit3: definitely had my view changed. I wanted examples of positives and I received examples with sources. I appreciate everyone’s responses, and feel better about having informed conversation about DJT’s presidency. Still have a lot to read and respond to!",1
CMV: politicians should be required to wear NASCAR-style jumpsuits showing all their major sponsors.,29461,870,2020-07-16 21:47:38,"In recent days some have decried the POTUS and FDOTUS brazenly ignoring federal ethics laws by posing with a certain company's bean products.

"CMV: US presidential candidates should take an exam covering US government and law, foreign policy, as well as undergo a comprehensive cognitive exam.",28352,1209,2020-07-06 18:44:21,"Edit: Ok, this has been fun and some great conversation, but I am beginning to feel like a one-man army trying to defend the gates of Sparta. 

I have changed my mind for three reasons. 

1) Test-taking ability is not necessarily an indication of one's ability to run the office of the president. 

2) He who creates the questions dictates the barrier for entry. 

3) Freedom of speech is a slippery slope, and even though announcing one's intent to run for president can and will continue to be abused, you can't knock out one brick and expect the wall to remain intact. Therefore, I am hereby announcing my bid to run as VP with Kim Kardashian. 

I still believe standardized cognitive testing should be administered. This could be automated, perhaps using open-source N-Back software or various standardized cognitive testing designed to screen for early cognitive decline. 

Regardless of who you like, this is a democracy, so register to vote and get those ballots in by November! 

---- Original Post ----

The office of the President of the United States is being used as a tool to boost social media presence, to syphon votes, and to simply sell products. This is an abuse of the office of the presidency and should be illegal, especially if someone has zero intent on running or winning. 

To limit entry into this field, and to limit the abuse of power that has been recently demonstrated by Kanye West, it should be illegal to announce you are running for president unless you undergo a comprehensive set of exams that show you have at least a basic mental competency to run the United States of America. 

The results of these exams should be available to everyone as a pass/fail, though the exact scores should be held secret so as not to be used to favor one candidate with a higher score over another. They should cover cognitive, physical, as well as brain scans using MRI, EEG, etc.

While these tests may not completely stop such abuse, they would make it far more difficult for any celebrity to simply announce to their millions of Twitter followers that they are running for president. More importantly, voters could be assured that any candidate running for president has passed a basic competency exam, which would prevent candidates from using perceived cognitive decline as a political weapon.",1
CMV: Off-duty cops are just civilians and should have none of the legal protections of being a cop for their actions.,27356,1269,2020-06-25 21:55:07,"Off-duty cops are just regular people who are not at work. Whatever actions they do should be viewed legally as a civilian doing them. There is no reason why the legal protections of being a cop should extend to their activities off duty actions. If someone is in danger/breaking the law, they should intervene as a civilian, meaning they have no legal responsibility to provide aid or execute the law. If an off-duty cop kills someone, it should be treated as if that person where a civilian who killed someone. I am not arguing whether or not the actions of off duty cops are right or wrong, just that those actions are not special and should face the same legal scrutiny as any other civilian.

Edit to add: ""The St. Louis Metropolitan Department explained the work of its unnamed officer this way in a statement: “To clarify, secondary employment allows officers to work security in uniform and carry their department-issued weapons.

"CMV: Will Smith was correct in 2016 when he said, ""Racism is not getting worse, it's getting filmed"". One of the biggest problems in American society is Mean World Syndrome and these riots are evidence of that.",25927,2069,2020-06-01 09:43:56,"I imagine most rioters would justify their outrage by saying they're tired of unarmed men, especially black men, being killed by police at an alarming rate. But this is not supported by the data. In fact, [the opposite is true.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/fatal-police-shootings-of-unarmed-people-have-significantly-declined-experts-say/2018/05/03/d5eab374-4349-11e8-8569-26fda6b404c7_story.html?fbclid=IwAR2MjduOM-Ak37IhlNLTogd74u43hjxSWHS7YEXU8ajcQAqPQ2HyjohNKbA)

>The number of deadly police shootings of unarmed people has generally declined since 2015 even as the tally of fatal shootings by law enforcement is on pace to hit nearly 1,000 for the fourth year in a row, according to data gathered by The Washington Post.

And behold, in 2019, we have even fewer unarmed shootings than 2018, when this article was published. Justified police killings are staying steady, which is not ideal, but they are not increasing.

So why the widespread misperception of unarmed shootings getting worse?

**In 2016, Will Smith said,** [""Racism is not getting worse. It's getting filmed.""](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/will-smith-colbert-race-relations-obama-politics-sings-summertime-916816)

There's been some confusion about what he meant. Some say he meant it's bringing racism to the forefront of national attention. Not so.

""Smith said he disagrees with people who think that the situation has gotten progressively worse.""

I'm actually not even convinced that it's racism that we're seeing when a cop does something awful to a black suspect. That would be a [Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc) fallacy.

After all, [white cops are no more likely to shoot black suspects than black cops.](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/26/745731839/new-study-says-white-police-officers-are-not-more-likely-to-shoot-minority-suspe)

>The race of a police officer did not predict the race of the citizen shot. In other words, black officers were just as likely to shoot black citizens as white officers were.

I guess you could say black cops are racist against other black men but that seems unlikely. I'm not convinced of that, and it's impossible to prove either way.

So anyway, there's a concept in Sociology called [Mean World Syndrome.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_world_syndrome)

>Mean world syndrome is a cognitive bias where people perceive the world to be more dangerous than it actually is due to long-term, moderate to heavy exposure to violence-related content on mass media.Mean world syndrome asserts that viewers who are exposed to violence-related content can experience increased fear, anxiety, pessimism and heightened state of alert in response to perceived threats. This is because media (namely television) consumed by viewers has the power to directly influence and inform their attitudes, beliefs and opinions about the world.

This concept is supported by the data I shared above about how unarmed shootings have actually decreased and are continuing to decrease.

I think even vehement anti-police advocates would have to concede that this is a very real and very salient problem in mass media. After all, the phrase ""If it bleeds it leads"" has been around in journalism for decades.

This is what has helped inspired so much anti-police hatred. The media is very skilled at manipulating the populace into fear and distrust.

If you don't believe me just look at the [2016 shooting of Dallas police officers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_shooting_of_Dallas_police_officers) by a man who was radicalized by the media and/or black lives matter.

>On July 7, 2016, Micah Xavier Johnson ambushed and fired upon a group of police officers in Dallas, Texas, killing five officers and injuring nine others. Two civilians were also wounded. Johnson was an Army Reserve Afghan War veteran and was angry over police shootings of black men and stated that he wanted to kill white people, especially white police officers. The shooting happened at the end of a protest against the police killings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, which had occurred in the preceding days.

I see this as one of the most egregious examples of Mean World Syndrome.

# So what would change my view is a perspective that suggests that the public's extreme reaction to this most recent police killing is not actually Mean World Syndrome, but some other reason that has a rational basis.",1
"CMV: The most sensible thing to do if you're ever given a chance to sell your soul to Satan is to refuse, because the existence of Satan would be implicit proof of an afterlife",24134,2136,2020-09-04 22:34:34,"Stories where people sell their soul to the devil make no sense to me for one specific reason. If the devil makes you that offer, it is proof that he exists. And if he exists, then that means some sort of afterlife must exist as well,  because the  ""trade off"" for whatever gain you make from selling your soul is eternal damnation in hell. 

Whereas if you just decline and live a virtuous life for the next 80 years or whatever, you get to go to heaven instead. Even if you live in the most wretched, abject poverty on Earth, suffering through 80 years of that in exchange for a good afterlife experience seems to make way more sense to me than whatever temporary comfort and eternal damnation you'd get from selling your soul.

"CMV: If employers expect a two week notice when employees quit, they should give the same courtesy in return when firing someone.",23098,1490,2020-10-17 00:58:38,"I’ll start off by saying I don’t mean this for major situations where someone needs to be let go right away. If someone is stealing, obviously you don’t need to give them a two week notice. 
 
So to my point. 

They always say how it’s the “professional” thing to do and you “don’t want to burn bridges” when leaving a job. They say you should give the two week notice and leave on good terms. Or that you should be as honest with your employers and give as much heads up as possible, so they can properly prepare for your replacement. I know people who’s employers have even asked for more than the two weeks so that they can train someone new. 

While I don’t disagree with many of this, and do think it is the professional thing to do, I think there is some hypocrisy with this. 

1) Your employers needs time to prepare for your departure. But if they want to let you go they can fire you on the spot, leaving you scrambling for a job. 

2) The employer can ask you to stay a bit longer if possible to train someone, but you don’t really get the chance to ask for a courtesy two weeks. 

3) It puts the importance of a company over the employee. It’s saying that employee should be held to a higher standard than an employer. As an employee you should be looking out for the better of this company, and be a “team player”. 

Sometimes there are situations where giving a two week notice isn’t needed. If you have a terrible employer who you don’t think treats you fairly, why do you need the two week notice? If you feel unappreciated and disrespected, why is it rude to not give a notice? 

If that’s the case then why do people not say the same about employers firing people with no notice? How come that’s not rude and unprofessional? Why is that seen as a business move, but giving no notice of quitting is seen as unprofessional? 

If we’re holding employees to a standard, we should hold companies to the same standards. 


EDIT: Thank you for all the responses, I didn't think this would get this large. Clearly, I can't respond to 800 plus comments. I understand everyone's comments regarding safety and that's a valid point. Just to be clear I am not in favor of terminating an employee that you think will cause harm, and giving them two weeks to continue working.

It seems any attention the name recieves is ""shaming"" or ""bullying.""

I feel terrible that a child is involved in this, but I don't see any other explanation then this girl mother planned for and most likely desired this situation when she chose a name.

It seems down right delusional to select an absurd or elaborately out of the ordinary spelling for a name and not expect attention or criticism. It would be nice if that wasn't the world we lived in, but really believing that would be a break from reality.  And what is the point of a 'unique' name other than standing out and seeking attention?

I'm honestly more appalled by the indignation of the mother than actions of the airline employee who starts this...


Edit: so I need to clarify. I'm not trying to argue that the worker who shared it wasn't crossing a line. What she did was unprofessional. People keep trying to direct the conversation in that direction, but I agree with it - my position is more that the parents are culpable in this too.

"CMV: Gender Dysphoria is a cureable mental illness, we've stopped looking for the cure because society is now forced into accepting transgenders.",21672,2910,2020-02-12 17:15:36,"I know this is a big yikes to post in 2020, but I am posting this because I truely want my view to be changed. I know it is offensive to a lot of people. I have only met one transgender in my entire life and my view is probably mostly based on this person, let's call her Lana, and on the transgenders you see on the television.

Lana was male till the age of 19, where he told me he thought he was a girl. It was a very surreal moment for me, he had a huge beard and manly structure and there he sat, telling me he felt like he was a girl. I knew for sure he was joking (we had a habit of making fucked up jokes) so i bursted out in laughter. He told me again and added that he wanted to start progressing into a female. This was 7 years ago.

I knew Lana has been dealing with mental illness her entire life. She had a very rough childhood due to undiagnosed autism, adhd and depression. For some reason I connected that in my head to her becoming a transgender; She had undiagnosed problems and concluded that she didn't fit in because she wasn't in the right body. Writing this out makes my face turn red a little because i know thoughts like these are heavily frowned upon, but it is what i currently truely believe. I think proper therapy could have been a solution to let him deal with his past and feel comfortable and confident about who he is. I don't think mutilating body and everyone acting like she's a girl should be an acceptable cure.

Every time I see people on television interacting with transgenders, they seem very  disingenuous to me. Patronizing, almost. *Wow, you're so brave and stunning.* Thoughts that come to mind are: For gods sake, stop playing along, this person is suffering and needs serious mental help, not to be put on a pedestal. I feel the same whenever Im near Lana and out of respect, I've distanced myself from her. I don't want to offend her, and i don't want to play along / support what i think is a cureable illness. I've studied Social Work Childcare, which probably plays part in why i think like i do.

&#x200B;

I'm sure that if Lana wasn't bullied as much as she was, he would've felt more like he fit in. I'm convinced that his autism, adhd, and depression, next to not fitting in, made him feel feminine, and more distanced to his masculinity.

Please change my view.

"CMV: Big Cruises do more harm than good, and the planet is better off if the industry dies or is overhauled.",19830,1074,2020-04-06 21:55:29,"I guess I should start by saying I have a pretty substantial hatred of crowded spaces. Call it what you want. Enochlophobia. Agoraphobia, etc. I don't even like going to concerts, crowded movie theaters on opening day, etc. 

That said, I just feel the whole concept of a cruise is weird. Other than supplying hundreds of thousands of people with jobs (at least here in the USA), I don't see a ton of true benefits this industry provides vs. harm,  as it currently stands now. Granted, perhaps some changes will come along to make cruises less harmful to our planet, but so far, I see no evidence that the cruise industry is making the world a better place. 

* First, pollution: These ships are giant floating cities that create TONS of waste. And even despite regulation, each cruise ship contributes to some portion of sewage, gray water, hazardous wastes, oily bilge water, ballast water, and solid waste being dumped into our oceans, rivers, etc. Nevermind the air pollution they can cause; [with one study even claiming](https://www.transportenvironment.org/sites/te/files/publications/One%20Corporation%20to%20Pollute%20Them%20All_English.pdf) that Carnival cruise ships emitted nearly 10 times more sulfur oxide around European coasts than did all 260 million European cars in. With Royal Caribbean at four times more than the European cars. 
* Then there is the whole disease problem. Clearly, things like COVID-19 will continue to happen. Maybe not every year, but putting thousands of people in a confined ship for a week, floating out in the middle of the ocean seems like an awful idea. Not to mention the cycle of stopping at new ports, letting people off, and in turn, letting them infect each destination the cruise liner embarks for. The damn thing is like a floating petri dish. 
* You're basically trapped in a floating mall for 7 days, where everything is overpriced. Even if you think that all-inclusive price is a bargain, everyone I know who has taken a cruise has spent more money than they anticipated; be it booze, gifts, etc. I know there are cruise lines like Sea Dream, which truly are ALL-INCLUSIVE, but most of the big players (Carnival, RC, Norwegian, etc.) nickel and dime you to death. Not to mention, most affordable rooms are small and cramped, and you'll rarely ever spend more than a day at port at any number of the destinations you visit, giving you very little time to take in the scenery, culture, etc. 

Again, not saying all cruise lines are bad. But the MEGA ones with THOUSANDS of people on them seem terrible, and I just can't see how they actually are more beneficial than bad for our planet, economy, etc. That said, I'm open to understanding why this industry is a good thing. CMV.


**EDIT/UPDATE**

* First, wow. Didn't expect this to take off the way it did. 
* Second, I realize my third bullet point has more to do with my personal distaste for cruises and does very little to strengthen my argument/view. This has nothing to do with people who like cruises vs. people who do not. 
* Third, there was a ton of information I left out of my OP that supports my view, such as how cruises can [disrupt marine life](https://usa.oceana.org/threat-marine-life), and how [working on a cruise](https://www.businessinsider.com/cruise-ship-workers-describe-grueling-conditions-job-2019-11) can be a terrible experience for the crew, etc. 
* Finally, my view hasn't *really* changed. If anything, due to the fact there are so many poorer/smaller economies that depend on cruises for revenue, etc. - I'm much more in favor of overhauling the industry vs. seeing it die. But again, this post was never about making cruises ILLEGAL or banning them. Just give it a nice facelift. /cheers.",1

The US has a [Gini coefficient](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_wealth_equality) (measurement of wealth inequality) of 0.852 (with a coefficient of 1 meaning almost complete wealth inequality).

The US consistently has more [deaths from treatable diseases](https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/mortality-rates-u-s-compare-countries/#item-age-adjusted-major-causes-of-mortality-2015) than comparable countries (UK, Canada, France, Australia, etc)

**Quality education is only accessible to those with money -**

[Average cost of higher education](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/paying-for-college-infographic) ranges from $10k to $36k, compared to virtually nothing in other Western nations. This means higher education either burdens US students with a lifetime of debt, or keeps all but the wealthiest from attending.

The US is [31st](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.usnews.com/news/education-news/articles/2019-12-03/us-students-show-no-improvement-in-math-reading-science-on-international-exam%3fcontext=amp) in the world in reading, math and science, with 27% of top US performers registering as wealthy while only 4% as poor or disadvantaged.

**And when it comes to raising a child...**

You need a [ton of money](https://www.epi.org/child-care-costs-in-the-united-states/#/AL) for that too, due to lack of free child care and no federal family leave policy. And that link shows Alabama, probably one of the cheapest states to live in in the whole country.

**With the police** In response to police brutality, police around the country responded with unprecedented violence (going as far as to run protesters over with cars and shoot people (who aren’t even protesting) on their porches. They specifically targeted journalists trying to report on the situation. Nations around the world have condemned the US response to what have been by and large peaceful protests.

Despite Roe v Wade being a [bipartisan decision](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/70-18) by the Supreme Court, Republicans still campaign on stacking the court and directing them to overturn the decision, not only taking away a woman's right to seek an abortion, but grossly overstepping the separation of the executive and judicial branches, all because of religious values.

And this was after he Tweeted about wanting to delay the election (even if it was a red herring to distract from the disastrous economic numbers). McConnell also refused to consider the stimulus bill due to the USPS funding, further screwing over average Americans.

And don't get me started on McConnell, the man who has basically made it his life's work breaking our democracy.

We're [number 1 in gun violence](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41488081), but large swaths of the country still prefer that to any form of gun control.

I'm sure I'm forgetting one stat or another, but I feel like it's been covered pretty sufficiently. Is America the worst country in the world? No. I'm not going as extreme as to say we live in a 3rd world country. But by the standards of other developed nations, the US lags *far* behind in almost every aspect I can think of.

For Americans who don’t have money (or aren’t willing to go into crippling debt because god forbid you want healthcare or to be educated), you’re basically screwed, and would almost certainly be better off living somewhere in Western Europe or Scandinavia instead. Change my view.

\*Feel like I should put a disclaimer that I am going by the numbers. I have lived a comfortable life here, as I'm sure many others have. But my argument is also that if you have lived a comfortable life here, either that indicates some level of wealth/power, and/or that your quality of life would still be better in a European/Scandinavian country.

Change my view.

\*Edit - Felt that I should include that our federal minimum wage is only [$3k a year above the poverty line](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/022615/can-family-survive-us-minimum-wage.asp) and unable to support a person living anywhere in the country

**EDIT 1 -** Since I keep getting the same points repeated to me over and over again, I'll just address them here since I just got the notification this hit the front page. I definitely won't be able to address even most of these comments at this point but I'll do my best.

Comment I made about homelessness - I know that made no sense, you can stop bringing it up

For the people who are telling me that I can't compare the US to European countries - I awarded a delta for someone who pointed out that it would be better to look at the EU as a whole. However, I don't think it's a legitimate argument to entirely write off comparing the US to individual countries, since while we may have a massive population (and GDP to match), our [per capita GDP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita) isn't that much higher than the countries I'm comparing it to.

And to reiterate again, I am not arguing that it is impossible to achieve a good life here in the US, or that we're a 3rd world country. Maybe you or your great grandparents immigrated here and made a good life for yourselves, and that's great. But overall, the US is not the best in terms of economic opportunity (like I addressed in the OP)",1
CMV: Bernie supporters who would sit out if he doesn't win the nomination are acting like spoiled brats,18391,6594,2020-03-04 00:30:31,"As things stand right now, I do feel like I align the most with Sanders from an ideological perspective. I don't agree with all of his policy goals, but his rationales behind promoting these policies are admirable and the kind of attitude we need in a president. 

That being said, if Joe Biden wins the Democratic nomination, I would enthusiastically vote for him. Bernie himself even recognizes the potential crisis for progressive values if Trump were to win a second term. In my mind, it should be viewed as objectively better to vote for someone who shares 80-90% of the same progressive values, will help work to pass liberal legislation, and will get the country on the path for additional progressive policies in the near future than it is to allow Trump to continue to dismantle our institutional integrity and hope for a reactionary leftist resurgence in 2024. 

And to add on that last point, I think it's really stupid that left wing voters would hope that their side acts like the right does whenever the center-left does anything. Reactionary politics sucks in the long run. It's the reason why, other than the ACA (which I'll get to in a minute), no major federal programs have been passed for a long time. The Bernie bros are acting like the Tea Party. The Tea Party is already dead, suffocated with a plastic bag by the Trumpist cartel. Unless the Democratic Socialist wing is willing to put in the work for long term, consistent success instead of being reactionary, they'll be gone too before they're able to properly implement any of their lofty but well intentioned goals. 

Now back to the ACA. Getting that passed was a huge accomplishment that nobody should take lightly. It's far from perfect, but it's something. It's the biggest initiative in the federal government since the Civil Rights Act, and the biggest tangible social policy implemented since FDR passed Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Those amazing things were all passed during periods of consistent Democratic control of congress while Eisenhower (who was hardly conservative relative to today) and Nixon/Ford held power for only 16/48 years last century. If Bernie supporters want to implement any major policies like those, they need to be willing to bite their tongues and vote for more moderate Democrats now and incrementally get more progressive over time, which doesn't have to be that long of a time. They just have to show up now so we don't keep going back and forth.

I don't really have a knock against Bernie. I think he's a great man and a great candidate and I hope he does well today so my vote for him in the next couple rounds means something. If people are willing to rally around him now, this isn't as much of a concern.

But a lot of his supporters, from the most affluent Bernie bros to the actual working class people who are willing to not show up if Biden wins the nom, are acting spoiled. In my view, if Biden wins and you're not willing to show up for him in the general, it obviously must not be that important to you to get these major policies passed. Like if you're actually struggling and you think Bernie-style policies are what you need to improve your situation, you should be willing to take 80-90% of that instead of nothing. If not, I don't believe that you're actually struggling, you just like to act like a victim. 

So CMV, is there actually any value to this all or nothing attitude where you're willing to lose unless you get 100% of what you want, or are people acting ridiculous?

**EDIT: This is blowing up so apologies if I take a little while to respond. Already gave out a delta but I'm absolutely going to be following up throughout the day. Thanks for the great responses (even to the people spite downvoting me) I'll try to get to you soon.**

**EDIT 2: I keep seeing a lot of the same comments so just know I'm not going to get to everyone. I just don't have the time for 1900 comments when so many are the same. So here's a couple things I don't agree with so that the comments might slow down.** 

1. I simply do not agree and will not agree that letting Trump win now is strategically sound for future progressive candidates because four more years of Trump is four more years of the GOP rigging elections and installing policy roadblocks, so unless your game theory argument is much different, save it. 

2. I'm not going to be convinced that Biden is worse than Trump.

3. Our political system is what it is. You don't get to stick it to the man by letting the man win again. Go vote for people who will do most of what you want instead of the opposite of what you want.

CMV: Religion has absolutely no place in a modern society.,17731,1774,2020-10-17 21:33:47,"Religion has had some good in the past, when people where absolutely ignorant about the world. It used to be a great tool to answer unsolvable mysteries and guide people who had no idea what the fuck life was about.

However, it has also ALWAYS been about controlling the masses and brainwashing. These poor people constantly living in fear of chastisement by some infinitely powerful being. You better act nice now, or (insert your divinity here) will fuck you up for eternity!

Oh what's that? You guys believe in a different god than us? Looks like it's time for a god damn blood bath! But sure, religions are about peace and kindness, unless you don't believe in the right one.

Also I already see you guys coming with the ""oh but don't put all the apples in the same basket, there's some bad religious people, but there are some good ones too!!"" 

Fuck that bro. The actions of those bad apples far outweigh the positive aspects of the good ones. Yes some religious people contribute to charity and stuff, but do you really need religion for that? Can't you just be a good person without it?

Also, how is no one calling them cults? It's the same fucking thing. If some nutjob claims to be the son of a god today, everyone laughs at him and calls him crazy, cause he is, but sometimes he gets a following and we're all like ""well clearly this is a cult. These people are fucking stupid to believe that this guy is any kind of divinity whatsoever"". How many of the ones who laugh at cults are actually religious? I'd bet it's a fuckton of'em, but sure, fuck introspection and let's all be hypocrites.

My final point now, some of you may argue that religion is also about spirituality and trying to better yourself as a person, it's a moral compass. Again, fuck that shit! You don't need a fucking cult leader who's been dead for thousands of years to tell you how to act. We have social norms and things that are acceptable and things that aren't. Just be a fucking adult and reflect on your actions and thoughts and better yourself that way. Most religious people, as I said earlier, only follow that ""moral compass"" to escape an imminent doom when they die, not to actually be good people. They do it out of fear, and I don't think that makes you a good person, that makes you a coward who's scared of something nonexistent.

Religion should and needs to be abolished, but of course that'll never happen. Oh well.

Tl/Dr : Religions are about controlling people, have been and always will be a source of violence and hatred. They are cults and need to be abolished.

Edit: Just to clarify, I do not wish any harm or hatred towards any religious people and I am for letting people belive what they want to, live and let live. However I just think religion shouldn't be a part of our society ANYMORE. I am against religion as a CONCEPT in a MODERN society. Not against religious PEOPLE. I know religion was a pillar of humanity IN THE PAST. I do not think it is still required TODAY.

Thank you for your time everyone, there are some insghtful comments that made me reflect and I did soften my view on the subject. ""Abolishing"" religion was a poor choice of words, it should just die out slowly while only keeping the positive morals of it, through education. However, my view is not changed.

"CMV: Americans treat / discuss about 9/11 as if it was one of the worst or most devastating events in history, it shows both how hypocritical American's are as in regards to international affair as well as how narrow-minded some American's are.",16801,1298,2020-07-20 04:32:24,"Okay, the total number of lives that were lost during 9/11 was: 2977. Because of this (not purely) the US invaded Afghanistan as well as began the ""war on terror"". From the West, since the Afghan war began there have almost been 4k military deaths (Western states only), almost 100k deaths/serious injuries to CIVILIANS in the last 10 years within Afghanistan alone. If you want to add the 10 more years since they began the war, plus the many other countries they have ruined economically and physically then the number is easily tenfold.

Please don't get me wrong, it was a tragedy and an act of terrorism, but the way that Americans speak about it and describe the events, its as if they way to justify the millions and millions of lives they have ruined in response. It's also not just the way they speak of it or remember it, its the EXTREMELY hypocritical ways in which leading US politicians/economists/leaders reference it, some examples:

Rudy Giuliani: ""The attacks of September 11th were intended to break our spirit. Instead we have emerged stronger and more unified. We feel renewed devotion to the principles of political, economic and religious freedom, the rule of law and respect for human life. We are more determined than ever to live our lives in freedom""

Sandy Dahl: ""If we learn nothing else from this tragedy, we learn that life is short and there is no time for hate.""

Let me start by saying that I am willing to change my mind on this perspective. The opinion that I would like changed is that the way, in general, that American's depict 9/11 is disgustingly hypocritical and overtly dramatic, revealing how narrow-minded the majority of American's can be/are. The American discourse surrounding 9/11 and the proceeding events are so slanted in the American favour that it undermines the impact they had on Afghanistan and the innocent civilians in all of the Middle East.

&#x200B;

Edit 1: Thank you for all the responses! I have definitely shifted my opinion slightly, there are a lot of responses so I will do my best to respond to everyone.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: Again thank you for the all responses, especially the informative and constructive ones. I have altered my opinion on how and what the general American thinks about the 9/11 and the proceeding events - however, I remain that the discourse from US media and institutional leaders is still hypocritical and reveals their slanted perspective of international affairs.

"cmv: Ban on sleeping in vehicles is just targeting lower-income and impoverished persons. There is no justifiable reason to have a ban on living in a vehicle in larger cities and smaller towns alike, so long as the vehicular occupant is not being disruptive or breaking other laws.",16536,651,2020-07-26 14:33:36,"Update 3: Stop sending me bloody threats or your opinions through private message. 

I received a message, and I quote ""If you want people to sleep in cars so bad, why don't we have them all park outside your house, so they can sell drugs in your property, r\*pe your daughters, murder your spouse, and leech off the government but pin it all on your hands?"" You don't need to verbally assault someone for an opinion on any matter in the world. If you want to debate this, comment on the threat. I'm declining all PM's about the issue here on out.

Update 2: I've had a field day replying to all of you guys. I've changed my opinion a fair bit. It's a difficult topic- on one hand, morally speaking, i want to be able to make it easier for people to get off the street. But, to make it legal to sleep in a typical car, there are so many things that have to be taken into consideration- legal changes, new regulation, taxation, sanitary conditions. I've decided to retract my statement, and change my opinion that it should be legal to sleep in any vehicle. However, I add this:

1. Sleeping in regulation-conforming vehicles (i.e vans, trucks, minivans) that have adequate space, are kept sanitary, can generate electricity, are ""livable"" should be legal and permitted. Sleeping in an everyday civic, or another car that is not designated for sleeping permanently should not be allowed, except in the following circumstancesa. the person can not get home safely and just needs to sleep for a short period of time, or the person is under the influence of substances and feels unsafe operating their vehicle, and cannot get other accommodation or rideshare, so they sleep in their vehicle outside of a bar, party location, etc.b. the person is in a domestic or violent situation where it is unsafe for them to return homec. the person is camping in a campsite (which shouldn't be an issue with the topic of this post at all) and chooses to sleep in their vehicled. the persons who are sleeping in the vehicle are travelling, and it is not a permanent situationAll of the aforementioned conditions would make it absolutely legal to sleep in your vehicle.
2. If there was to be a provision made in the future to allow sleeping in vehicles, and allow vehicles to be considered a property, a property tax should be instated on it, that way taxpaying homeowners do not feel disadvantageda. in a sense, the registation fee of a vehicle and the other monthly costs could be considered a property tax, but I know it wouldn't make everyone happy. A tax of living in the vehicle would make sense- but then again, would it? It's the best common ground.
3. Sleeping in a vehicle in the same location for more than 12 hours should be disallowed, to ensure people do not ""reside"" in one location and block traffic, or begin to claim territory as their own. Occupants would be required to move their vehicle throughout city streets. If this does not happen, their vehicle will be towed after warnings.

Keep this in mind if you choose to comment on my post any further. I will read replies, but I am struggling to keep up with all of them. I didn't expect this to go viral; it was mostly a rant. But, you guys changed my mind, and I appreciate that. I didn't think it would happen when I made this post, but it sure has.

Update 1: **I'm going to go ahead and continue replying to everyone who shares their thoughts or opinion, but I do want to say that my opinion has definitely been altered. I still stand adamant that it should not be illegal, ESPECIALLY in the cases which the person residing in their vehicle is not homeless but has income and can afford insurance, a license, and is not in a condition that they are unfit to drive. Though, there must be regulation, and potentially taxation, especially in urban areas and large cities. Thanks to everyone who replied, and thank you for those who are reading this. I appreciate you all!**

&#x200B;

I fail to grasp any logic behind big cities banning people from sleeping in vehicles they own instead of living in a permanent house.

First of all, it's expensive as hell to live in a house. It can cost 1500/month or greater to rent a small apartment in a big city such as San Diego, about 30 minutes away from where I live. It is extremely taxing on those who are struggling with minimum wage or low paying jobs, and makes it much more difficult for homeless persons to get out of their situation. It would be much more cost effective, and much easier for those who are struggling, to survive if they were to get a van or use a vehicle and live in that. What would be 1,500+ a month could be cut into a 200 or 300$ monthly payment.

Someone who's living alone may not want a house. In my situation, I'm currently saving up for a van in order to live on the road while I work from my mobile home. This is great for me; I love travel, don't have a lot of possessions, and am a very simplistic person. It's a much cheaper, much more enjoyable, experience- and the fact that I may have to be careful not to visit certain cities or wander too far into town during the night to park my vehicle always worries me a bit about my future. If someone chooses to live in their car, so long as the conditions are livable (i.e no mold/leaking oil/some kind of air circulating in the vehicle) there should be no legal issue with that.

It's much safer for someone to pull off in their vehicle than it is to continue driving while tired. I remember one time, I was driving down the freeway and I was just too tired to continue. Knowing that if I pulled off to sleep I would be woken up and told to leave by a LEO, I continued driving. I actually fell asleep for brief (1-2 seconds) moments at the wheel, each one I jerked awake the minute I started to feel my car moving out of my lane. It was scary, and I would've much rather been able to legally pull off into a neighborhood or a city street and sleep for the night.

I would love someone to educate me as to why this is illegal. I struggle to find justifiable reasons as to why someone would not be allowed to sleep, or even live, out of their car. Anything that would normally require an address or established residence can easily be made up for, such as a laundromat rather than an in home machine, a P.O box, a cell phone instead of a landline, using public facilities instead of a personal toilet, vans can be rigged with electricity (the car produces electricity if needed through an inverter that can be plugged into the port in the dash) and, without a doubt, it's safer than sleeping on the street.

Car sleeping can be done discretely, without being a disturbance, and without the public even noticing or being affected. It seems to me like the perfect way for someone who may not make 1,500 a month, but closer to 5-600 a month, to be able to save while still having a guaranteed place to sleep.",1
"CMV: The electoral college is garbage and those that support it are largely doing so because it helps their side, not because of any real feature of the system",16419,2026,2020-07-21 20:55:14,"I don't think anyone could change my mind on the electoral college, but I'm less certain about the second part.  I don't particularly like throwing away swaths of arguments as bad faith, but the arguments for the EC are so thin that it's hard to see supporting it as anything other than a shrewd political ploy. Here are my main reasons for supporting a popular vote rather than the EC.

1. In general, popular sovereignty is good.  It should take very powerful considerations to take elections out of the hands of the people.  I don't feel the need to argue for a popular vote system because it's so clearly the best option for a nation that claims to be Democratic. You can say the whole Republic/Democracy thing and I super-duper don't care. I know we are a Republic.  I passed high school civics.  We could have a popular vote system that chooses the executive and still be a Republic.  The EC is *almost* a popular vote system the way it operates now.  It's given the same result as a popular vote system 91% of the time.  The times that it hasn't have been random, close elections.
2. ""One person, one vote"" is a valuable principle, and we should strive to live up to it.  Simple arithmetic can show that a voter in Wyoming has around 3 times more influence on the EC than a voter in California.  This wouldn't be true if it wasn't for the appropriations act in the 1920's, which capped the number of people in the House of Representatives at 435.  In the EC as it was designed, California would have many more electoral votes now, and the gap between Wyoming and Cali wouldn't be nearly as large.
3. There is no fundamental value in giving rural America an outsized say in elections.  I've often heard that the EC was created to protect rural interests.  This isn't true, but even if it was, I don't see the value in giving small states more influence.  This is where I developed the idea that most of the arguments are in bad faith.  Particularly because the current kind of inequality we have now in the EC was never intended by the founders.   If you are supporting the EC just because it favors rural areas, and you also know rural areas tend to vote red, then you just have that position for partisan reasons.
4. The ""elector"" system is very dumb and bad.  Do we really want 538 people that we've never heard of to get the ability to overturn an election?  This isn't a group of able statesmen, the electors are largely partisan figures.  In most states, you don't even see that you are voting for an elector instead of for a candidate for president.  These are elected officials only in the most vague sense of the term.  The idea that this ceremonial body is some kind of safe-guard is laughable.
5. The concept of ""swing states"" is bad for democracy.  Focusing on groups of swing voters in 5/6 states leads to undue attention and money being used to persuade smaller groups of voters. It also creates a sense of votes being worthless. I was a Democrat in a deep red state for a long time, and it felt like my vote didn't matter because my state was going to go red anyway.  And that's going to be true for most voters, apart from the 5/6 swing states that are uncertain on election day.  It's hard to know if that is pushing turnout down, but it certainly isn't having a positive effect.
6. The EC makes elections less secure.  Instead of a popular vote system where it would take a hue effort to change enough votes to make a difference, rigging state elections in swing states could have a huge impact.  The targets for interference are clear, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, North Carolina and Florida could be changed with relatively small numbers of votes.  This also makes voter suppression a tactic that can work on a national scale, if applied in the correct states.

EDIT: 

Alright, I need to get to my actual work-job instead of rage-posting about the electoral college. I've enjoyed reading everyone's responses and appreciate your participation. Some final responses to some underlying points I've seen:

1. Lots of people saying I just hate the EC because of Trump. I have literally hated the electoral college since I learned about it in the 6th grade. For me, this isn't (fully) partisan. I absolutely would still be against the electoral college if a Democrat won the EC and a Republican won the popular vote. I know you may I'm lying, and I grant that this isn't something I can really prove, but it's true. Feel free to hold me to it if that ever happens. My position is currently, and always has been, the person who gets more votes should be president.
2. The historic context of the electoral college, while important to understanding the institution, has an outsized influence on how we talk about presidential elections. I would much rather look forward to a better system than opine about how wise the system set up in 1787 was. The founders were smart, smarter than me. But we have 350 years of hindsight of how this system practically works, which is very valuable.
3. I was wrong to say all defenses of the EC were bad faith or partisan, I see that now. I still believe a portion of defenses are, but there are exceptions. The fact that most discussions of the EC happen just after a close election give all discussions surrounding the issue a hyper-partisan tone, but that doesn't have to be the rule.
4. If you think farmers are worth more to the country because they're farmers, I have some news to you about who was doing the farming in 1787. It wasn't the voters, I can tell you that much.
5. I'm sorry if I appeared brusque or unappreciative of your comments, this thread got way more attention than I expected. I'm re-reading my responses now and there's absolutely some wording choices I'd change, but I was in a hurry.

Hope you all have a good day. Abolish the electoral college, be gay, do crime, etc.",1

"CMV: America desperately needs a young, sane president",15547,1533,2020-08-07 08:53:12,"America desperately needs a young president and it’s gonna be my single issue in 2024. The choices we have this cycle have only reinforced my opinions. An old person can’t lead this country the right way without being a puppet (which Biden will be to his VP selection).

It’s getting to the point to where I’d vote for someone just based on his or her age. I’d vote age over party, policy, race, gender, and every other category possible. Older people deteriorate quickly and our 2 choices have clearly shown us they’ve gone fully insane. One doesn’t know what day it is and who he is, and the other blatantly lies to himself and the American people.

Edit: 

Ok maybe not age over policy. That was me just overthinking it. There’s a few up and coming political figures in which I disapprove of.

I’d like to see a legit mental health test for anyone running for President, especially for people over the ages of 65. Don’t make it mandatory, but if a candidate declines, you know they’re trying to hide their mental health. Also, I’m not answering questions about my political beliefs anymore.

Edit 2: 

Ok it seems like this has become an echo chamber. My mind won’t be changed here, but people are throwing out names of young politicians. My favorites, in order, are John James, Pete Buttigeg, Andrew Yang, Marco Rubio, Tulsi Gabbard, and Dan Crenshaw. **Also, mods have said to not comment names of politicians, they’re removing those comments. Don’t waste your time.**

Just because I want a young candidate doesn’t mean it’s because I want to push a certain far-left agenda. Couldn’t be further from the truth in my case. I want a young candidate on either side who’s willing to compromise (unlike AOC). Policy first, then age/mental wellness; my mind was changed on that.

Also, my definition of young is around 40-50 years old. That’s widely seen as young in politics.",1
CMV: Disney is monopolizing entertainment and needs to be checked before they start controlling culture,15361,885,2020-05-06 12:53:33,"Disney owns ESPN, 20th Century Fox, Hulu, Marvel, Star Wars, Comcast, History Channel, abc..the list goes on. [Here’s a link for anyone interested. ](https://storage.googleapis.com/titlemax-media/1c8ace8f-every-company-disney-owns-13_pageversion-lg.jpg)
This tells me they have dipped their toes into every form of entertainments that can be consumed by the population of earth. Controlling media and entertainment is how you control a culture or the way it thinks and acts. Disney is not doing anything too drastic with their agenda yet, but mark my words, there will come a time when all of the media you can find online or entertainment will be censored by Disney to fit their idea of what it should be. 

Let me break this down further. Disney has the authority to fire someone from one of their networks, especially a public one like ESPN, if they don’t agree with their views or agenda. Then, since they have money, they could make him disappear. Be it death by “suicide” or a lump sum to shut him up. So if a talk host on ESPN said something controversial but valid, Disney has the ability to control him and what the viewers hear. It’s censorship in the worst way. 

Disney owns too much and has the power to do too much. Let me make another example. Star Wars. I know, I know, “TLJ sucked, not canon! Duurrrrr!” I’m not here to bash the movies. I’m here to bash the EU. Disney is controlling what type of Star Wars is released to the public. Before Disney, there was a plethora of risqué Star Wars media. Video games, comics, books, etc. But now? It seems most Star Wars product are sterile, safe and innocent in an effort to maintain an identity for appealing to the whole family. Eff that! Star Wars was never restricted to one form of media and while the films were tamed, the rest could have done whatever it wanted! Here’s another one, Star Wars: Battlefront II the video game was under scrutiny for its loot box fiasco (gambling in games that kids can access). I have NEVER seen a game turn around as fast in my life and as delicately. My guess, Disney cracked the whip on EA and their 10 year game deal and EA panicked because money talks. If Disney has the power to do that to EA, they will have no trouble forcing an agenda into other networks that they own. 

Am I missing something? Does Disney not have the freedom I think they do with the networks they own? To me, it seems they’re orchestrating some type of cultural shift by acquiring networks and studios in all forms of entertainment in order to push their own ideas and agendas.

Edit: After reading through some of your comments, I think it’s necessary to clarify a few things.

1) I’m not an economist and my knowledge of this topic has been broadened immensely from just hearing what some of you had to say, so thank you for enlightening a dull individual such as myself. It has changed my view in some areas of this discussion. 

2) Comcast is NOT owned by Disney, I misread that detail when doing a quick research. I’m sorry for mixing that up. 

3) My terminology is not entirely accurate since I’m not as privy to the business side. But the spirit of the post is still intact and is directed at Disney having the control and influence over media and the ability to possibly censor or influence future generations.",1
CMV: Despite What Most People Believe Jesus' Ideals Were Closer to Communist Ideals Rather than Capitalist Ones,15154,1702,2020-08-04 17:37:35,"Jesus taught many things and one was that you cannot serve both God and money. (Matthew 6:24) Capitalism functions off of selfish desires and greed while communism is suppose to function off of the idea of reaching equality for all. You can argue about if that's been achieved successfully or not elsewhere but ideally communism represent a closer form of Government to the one in which Jesus was trying to show to the earth.

Jesus taught people to sell all they own and give the proceeds to the poor (Luke 12:33 and Luke 14:33) and if you imagine everyone doing this it will end up achieving an equal distribution of wealth and of material possession. 

Keeping this in mind this is what the early church actually did in Acts. 
Acts 4:32
""All the believers were one in heart and mind. No one claimed that any of their possessions was their own, but they shared everything they had.""
&
Acts 4:34-35
""that there were no needy persons among them. For from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them, brought the money from the sales and put it at the apostles’ feet, and it was distributed to anyone who had need.""

These actions and the teachings of Jesus line up way more with the ideal and ideas of communism than they do with capitalism.

[Here is a christian video I saw](http://bit.ly/WhatIfEvery1) which goes more in depth about people living this way and it sounds surprisingly similar to communism also.

I can't really think of any quotes of Jesus that would be in support of capitalism and how it functions as well which leads me to believe further that Jesus' ideals are closer to those of communist than of capitalist.",1

1. Biden is a centrist, unlikely to energize younger, more progressive voters. All he has done is alienate progressives with his promises to veto Medicare For All if it ever reached his desk.
2. Biden is in severe cognitive decline. Go look at the debates from 2012 between him and Paul Ryan, and then look at the debates he was in in 2019 and 2020. You'll see a noticeable difference, and Trump is going to eat him alive for this. He has trouble completing full sentences.

You might be wondering, ""Okay, it could be a tragic close loss, but surely not a landslide. What could possibly make you think that?"" This brings us to:

3. Trump is aiming to kill the United States Postal Service. If we have to conduct the 2020 election mainly by mail, this will make that impossible. It will be unsafe for people to vote in person in November, but the few people who are brave enough will be supporters of the candidate with more enthusiasm. That's Trump, hands-down.

CMV: Getting your driver’s license at 16 should not leave you set for the next 80 years.,14289,651,2020-10-10 21:03:39,"It is baffling and wildly irresponsible to allow people to continue driving for decades after they originally get their driver’s license with absolutely no follow-up to make sure they are aware of current roadway rules and/or physically capable of driving safely. 

I work as a traffic engineer and the number of older people who don’t understand semi-new concepts (RCIs, flashing yellow arrow, roundabouts) is unacceptable. Obviously some people are just going to be bad drivers regardless, but I can’t even fault these people because they’re never required to learn. 

A lot of issues that I encounter are just old people being old. And to a certain extent, there’s nothing wrong with that. But when you’re going 55 in a 70 or merging on the highway at 30 mph, you’re a danger to yourself and others. 

IMO, you should be required to re-take a driver’s test at age 60 and then continue retaking it every 5 years. Ideally, everyone should just take it every 10 years regardless of age, but the 60 year old rule would at least start to eliminate the people who are physically incapable of driving safely. 

Cars are crazy dangerous. Driving should be a privilege for those with knowledge and ability, not a right for absolutely everyone.

"CMV: As long as the animals are treated humanely and well, I see no problem in killing them for meat.",14033,3370,2020-05-16 14:53:40,"(My English is pretty good, but it’s not perfect. Please forgive me if I make any grammar mistakes in the following post!) 


Eating meat has always been a big part of our natural life. Vegans are completely valid in what they choose to do, but I find it a bit odd when they say that eating meat is “animal abuse.”

Animal abuse is a horrible thing. Animals should be treated with kindness and respect, for they are living beings as well. Anyone who chooses to treat an animal with cruelty, abuse, and pain is disgusting. 

However, slaughtering animals in order to eat them does not fall into the category of “abuse.” 

For example, let’s say there is a cow. This cow leads a healthy life with plenty of food, water, and all it needs to survive. Once it’s old enough, it gets killed in a painless, humane way and turned into steak. 

How is that animal abuse? The animal was treated humanely and lived a healthy life (until it’s final day, of course). 

We, as people, need protein. Meat is a way to obtain it. If we treat the animals humanely, it’s okay to eat them in the end.

My view is that using the phrase “my body my choice” or suggesting that pro-life is about controlling women misses the point entirely. Pro-life people don’t just believe it’s “your body and your choice” because it’s not just your body, it’s the body and life of a child.

I do believe many pro-life and pro-choice people could be misogynistic, intentionally or unintentionally, but I don’t think that it’s necessarily misogynistic to be pro-life if you only believe that abortion is murder because life begins at conception.

Although, I am open to the possibility that there is some angle that makes this simple pro-life view hypocritical.

For the record I am pro-choice. This isn’t an argument about the merits of aborting unwanted babies, the morals of late term abortions, or the science behind when life begins.

Suppose a company made two products: one with wide appeal, say, ice cream, and one with more niche appeal, say, quinoa. The company hires salespeople to sell each product and pays everyone 30% commission. Of course the ice cream salespeople will earn more money because they sell more ice cream because more people want ice cream than quinoa. It has nothing to do with who’s a better salesperson, it’s just based on their market share. No one would say that’s unfair just because they both have the title “salesperson”.

**EDIT: Well that escalated quickly...**

Wow - hanks for all of the great comments! The analysis and debate among CMVers, is so much better than you can get anywhere else. I probably owe a few more deltas when I get more time. Here’s a summary of some highlights so far (paraphrasing in italics):

*Kavanaugh is Different*

One area of this argument that I think is interesting and that I hadn’t thought about: *Urgency*.  There was an urgency to scrutinize BK’s background. None of us knew who BK was (rightly or wrongly), then suddenly he’s up for a lifetime appointment with GOP fast-tracking on the back of the Merrick Garland shenanigan So, even to a non-partisan, the need to evaluate Ford’s claims, and the media’s handling of the issue as something that needed to be urgently discussed seems more reasonable in contrast to Biden’s long career in the spotlight and gradual ramping towards President.  In general, I can give Democrats some credit for not having an ideal situation to set the standards for ""how to look into allegations"" given that handling the matter in a diligent and measured way was not really an option at the time.  Holding the media and Democrats to the standards set by BK-gate

*The 'true left' IS treating this as a big deal.*

My view on this was partially motivated by the fact that Bernie endorsed Biden after the allegations were known. So while there may be a strong reaction in some sectors of the Left, the reaction is either not a big deal or it hasn’t been “processed” yet by at least one person on the Left who matters in my view.

*The witness isn’t credible, because of recent behavior.*

I completely agree that the accuser may not be credible and commenters pointed at many good issues to look at. That said, the NYT reported there are 4-ish people who corroborate, to varying degrees, that something did happen in the early 90’s. This undermines the idea that the story was recently fabricated - even if the decision to publicize now is dubious. I credit the NYT and others for reporting this, but the degree to which they are covering her story, vs. the circumstantial evidence against her credibility seems disproportionate given past precedent. I suspect that has to do with the media being under a great deal of scrutiny to defend why they didn’t report on the matter more proactively sooner.

*Innocent until proven guilty*

Interestingly, this view seems to be held by conservatives and liberals. The MeToo movement has put forward the idea that the conventional methods that we use to determine someone’s guilt or innocence have failed women (i.e. Crosby, Weinstein) and these methods need to adapt to take into consideration the power dynamic between accusers and perpetrators. The dynamic explains why a victim might continue to have a cordial public relationship with a perpetrator, when this type of thing might have formerly have proven a perpetrator ‘not guilty.’ Whether you agree with this line of thinking on not, my assertion is that this belief is held by a large enough number of Democrats and that it creates a problem with no easy answers in the Biden case.

**EDIT 2**

*Why not compare Biden to Trump?*

I guess I should explain that I don't think most voters are comparing Trump to Biden.  Most voters these days are either in one camp or the other.  The Right does not seem to care much about sexual misconduct unless it involves a figure that they can use as an example of hypocrisy of the Left. (Clinton, Weinstein etc.). So I don't think Trump's history is that relevant to what I mean by ""a big deal"" i.e. something that could influence the election.  It just doesn't really matter what Trump does at this point.  If he could shoot someone at Park avenue and get away with it, imagine what he could do to a woman?

But the Left does care about it.  The BK scandal is symbolic of the standard that the Left has set to deal with partially-corroborated accusations of sexual misconduct from the past against a powerful figure being considered for a high Political office. So that's why it is relevant in my analysis.

**EDIT 3**

I looks like Reade's mother may have ""corroborated"" her story in the 90's, removing another pillar in the ""Reade is a politically motivated hack"" narrative.   I can't reply to every individual post on this, but it seems to underscore the misguidedness of assuming Ford is automatically credible, while Reade must be held to a different standard.

One concept we have in American justice is the idea that someone who is sent to prison is ""paying their debt to society"".  The premise behind this is that a crime causes harm to society to a whole and having the criminal give up his or her quality of life for some time balance the scales.  If said person faced the same punishment without having owned that debt then the reverse must be true, society owes them a debt.  Since it is impossible to give them extra years on their life, the next best thing is to make the remaining years they have left as good as possible and financial compensation is the best way to do that.

The job market can be hard enough for anyone, let alone someone with a huge gap in their employment history.  Even if it is understood that the conviction was reversed there may be some employers who may be prejudiced against that person, maybe they feel that it's possible that they actually were guilty and don't want to hire them.  Even without such prejudice, it's hard to imagine a scenario in which a person with 15 years of experience would not get a job over someone who had 15 years of no job experience because they were in prison, save for an employer wanting to be charitable.  

Finally there is the concept of time away from ""life"".  Think about the things that you enjoy, that make life worth living.  Whether that be time with friends, family, travelling, going to concerts, or simply taking a walk outside, imagine having years taken from your life where you couldn't do these things.  Most people spend a large portion of their waking hours working to sustain a lifestyle of these things in their free time.  I spend time away from my wife at work, so that the time I do get to spend with her after work and on weekends is enjoyable and that we have necessities such as food and shelter.  Someone who has been wrongfully imprisoned shouldn't have to spend their time doing anything other than trying to make up for lost time.  They should be able to spend every day with their family and friends and just relaxing, doing things most of us hope to do in retirement.

But maybe there's something I missed, if you feel differently, see if you can change my view.

"CMV: r/unpopularopinion is no longer for actually unpopular opinions, just ""hot takes""",11667,404,2020-07-18 00:09:11,"None of the opinions that make it to the top of r/unpopularopinion are controversial or unpopular. They're just opinions that nobody really thinks about at first and typically will agree with because they make sense. When was the last time you saw an ""unpopular"" opinion on that subreddit that you disagreed with? 

Heck, even this post is just a ""hot take"" of the subreddit. I guarantee what I'm saying isn't unpopular, because it's true. A good post for this subreddit would be a truly unpopular opinion that few would agree with at first, but could either A) Understand why someone would have the opinion, or B) Be swayed to have a different opinion.

Just my ""unpopular"" opinion.

EDIT: I want to clarify a couple of things:

First, when I say ""hot take,"" I'm referring to an opinion about a topic that is not widely disagreed with, but is simply an opinion that doesn't occur to people very often. An example I am using is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/hssz4s/disney_people_are_weird/) post, which is currently trending on the subreddit. No one would disagree with this opinion, but nobody ever thinks to themselves ""Gee, those people are weird.""

A second thing I want to make clear is that r/unpopularopinion obviously defines what is ""popular"" by what is widely agreed upon by most people. The subbredit tells you to upvote what you disagree with and downvote what you agree with. The problem with this is that nobody really listens to that rule anyway, so you end up with people upvoting posts that they agree with, and thus, you have posts at the top of the subreddit that are only there because people agree with them. Also, the subbredit's sidebar makes it very clear it is a *discussion* subreddit. The problem with that is you can't discuss something you already agree with and just didn't think of before. For practical discussion about two different viewpoints to exist, there has to be some disagreement. And there just is very little of that in r/unpopularopinion anymore.

Several people have suggested sorting the subreddit by controversial to enhance the experience. I agree with this, but it doesn't really change my view about the subbredit overall being not what it's supposed to be.",1
CMV: The most efficient way to end police brutality is to make cops criminally liable for their actions on the job and stop funding their legal defense with public money.,11643,745,2020-05-29 05:59:41,"I think this is the fastest way to reduce incidents of police brutality. Simply make them accountable the same as everyone else for their choices.

If violent cops had to pay their own legal fees and were held to a higher standard of conduct there would be very few violent cops left on the street in six months.

The system is designed to insulate them against criminal and civil action to prevent frivolous lawsuits from causing decay to civil order, but this has led to an even worse problem, with an even bigger impact on civil order.

If police unions want to foot the bill, let them, but stop taking taxpayer money to defend violent cops accused of injuring/killing taxpayers. It's a broken system that needs to change.",1
CMV: The leadership of the US republican party is no longer interested in maintaining a fully democratic system.,11554,2252,2020-09-15 20:47:36,"I'll start with a disclaimer: this post will reference some things Trump did, but it's not about Trump directly. Rather it's about the current leadership of the republican party, which I'll simply refer to as the GOP.

My thesis is this: the GOP has known for some several decades that it's voter base is shrinking. It's response has increasingly been to target the systems and institutions underpinning democracy. During the Trump presidency at the latest the GOP has decided to take the next step and interfere in the elections directly to stay in power.

The GOP has known for some decades that demographic trends do not favor it's traditional base. Faced with that, there have been repeated debates about whether it's appeal needs to broaden. However, time and again the decision was made to focus on the already highly mobilised core voters rather than try to open up. The tea party movement has given the latest big push in that direction.

At the same time, political taboos have started falling, and it has been the GOP leading the push in most cases. REDMAP was a coordinated effort at gerrymandering. Citizens United was a conservative platform. Under Mitch McConnell, the US senate has become a graveyard of bills. A supreme court nomination was held up for months for Partisan reasons.

Now, a president is in office, backed by the GOP, who openly calls the election into question, has instated a personal friend with no obvious qualifications at the head of the postal service and is suggesting his supporters try voter fraud to see if the system is really safe. A president who is already on record soliciting foreign aid in his re-election By their continued support, the GOP is all but openly admitting that they do not care about the integrity of the election.

Now I am not suggesting the GOP will set up Trump as a dictator on November 4th. But neither will they accept the result of the election. They will do what they think they can get away with, until they have a grip on power that's no longer dependant on actual votes. I don't know whether they already know what their preferred end result looks like. But it does seem to me that genuine respect for democracy no longer features in it.",1
CMV: Waving the confederate flag is more disrespectful to the American flag than kneeling during the national anthem.,11455,583,2020-06-07 00:31:53,"This post probably isn’t for people who don’t think kneeling is disrespectful to the flag to begin with. But I feel there is a portion of the US population in the South that is adamant that you must stand for the national anthem but are also partial to displaying the confederate flag.

While the argument about what kneeling is really about has probably been in numerous other posts, some still believe it’s an insult to the American flag as well as the US military. Despite it being made clear the protest is not about the flag or the military people still think that performing the protest during the anthem and while the flag is specifically on display is disrespectful regardless of the intention.

In this regard, any display of the confederate flag, other than in a completely unambiguously historical context, is far more disrespectful to the American flag than kneeling is. Flying the confederate flag as a source of pride, even if it’s just pride of your own ancestry, is demonstrating that you are proud of a side that fought against what the current flag stands for now. It’s not to be confused with a state flag or anything like that. It’s a flag that specifically represents a way of life that the current flag is against.

I don’t necessarily want this to turn into an argument that the confederate flag isn’t about slavery, my case is that the confederate flag clearly represents a time when the country was divided and the confederate side lost, so still flying a confederate flag shows a continued act of divisiveness towards other Americans when the argument is that the American flag is a sign of unity. It would be similar to claiming you’re flying the Union Jack flag to show American patriotism. The Union Jack and confederate flag both represent losing sides of attempts to make America into something different than what it is now, so any claim to have pride in those flags is not American pride or patriotism, which is indirect conflict with true American patriotism and therefore disrespectful to the idea of what the American flag represents.

As mentioned above, I’m perfectly fine with anything being represented in an historical context. History is crucial and required for education. But there’s a pretty clear distinction between historical representation and what I’m talking about, so I’d rather not use this post to debate historical relevance.

CMV that if you think kneeling is disrespectful to the American flag then you should also think flying the confederate flag is disrespectful to the American flag, and even more so.",1
"CMV: the body positive movement should be based around people with unchangeable disabilities, not people who are overweight.",11442,766,2020-08-23 00:46:36,"
I believe that overweight or even underweight people should very much be part of the body positive movement and should remain that way. However they should not be the figurehead of the movement as a whole.

As I have found before, many people use the body positive movement as a excuse for not striving to change their BMI or their possibly fatal circumstances. A persons body weight, as I have found can at the very least be helped.

On the other hand, people who do not have control over their circumstances with their own body (someone with Down syndrome or people with other visible disabilities beyond their control etc.) often are not seen as a major part of the movement despite needing the support that the movement has to offer. 

I know this has flaws, but I would like to know an opposing view on the matter.",1

&#x200B;

So not a lot of dog in this fight, I'm not a huge hiphop (or rap) fan these days and what I do listen to is fairly underground - far from the poppy variant of this song. I just became aware of this debate and thought I'd chime in with my view here.

I'd also add a large part of why I'm so selective about the hiphop I do listen to is because [more than any other genre](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2496932/) it is prone to making incredibly crass and demeaning statements about women or hosting an unhealthy obsession over [sex without love](https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2016/12/12/music-genres-mention-sex/) as well as [drug use, violence, and all sorts of unhealthy, harmful, and negative themes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5066304/). More than any other genres hip hop and rap are an absolute minefield of misogyny (and all sorts of other shitty behaviors), something they [have been criticized for for a long time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny_in_rap_music).

So color me surprised when a song comes out made by women in the industry and follows all those same negative, demeaning, sexist tropes and is for some reason folks hail it as [""the epitome of female empowerment""](https://www.complex.com/music/2020/08/cardi-b-megan-thee-stallion-wap-essay) or claim, apparently without a trace of irony or satire, that [""surely the epitome of modern feminism is women rapping about the self-lubricating prowess of their vaginas.""](https://www.popsugar.co.uk/entertainment/cardi-b-wap-music-video-intersectional-feminism-essay-47679000)

...I mean... what the fuck, guys?

And I encourage you to [review the lyrics](https://genius.com/Cardi-b-wap-lyrics) of the song as well as the [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc5IbN4xw70) and ask yourself if these are signs of female empowerment or good things generally. Some various themes the song touches on:

* It refers to women as ""whores""
* It seems largely based on the idea of being proud of a well lubricated vagina, [something many women struggle with](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3008577/)
* It glorifies sugar baby/gold digger culture in which women trade sex for money or gifts
* It seems to promote unprotected (either from pregnancy or STDs) sex
* It preferences tight vaginas and large penises, which seems to be a form of body shaming both men and women who don't conform to these ideals
* It demeans men who engage in certain sexual acts with women
* It seems to shame women who might prefer a more ""traditional"" role in relationships or a more ""traditional"" view of sex
* It presents women and female body parts as sex objects

And on and on and on.

The various people promoting this track as the epitome of female empowerment - nay - the epitome of all of modern feminism, seem to be painfully unaware that their own promotion of, frankly, cringingly sexist drivel, is the reason why so many people are critiquing the song. Instead they chalk up all critiques of it to the usual suspects: misogyny, racism, religion, the patriarchy, etc. but also go so far as to somehow fit colonialism, FGM, Trump, Freud, and faked orgasms into the blame game.

As I pointed out, male produced hiphop and rap has *long* been critiqued for its sexism and objectification and shallow presentation of sexual interaction... so very obviously that critique of male-dominated rap exists *without* people penning articles calling incredibly sexist and demeaning male-produced rap or hiphop songs ""the epitome of male empowerment"" and claiming body shaming, objectification, unprotected sex, etc. are *good things* the way the various folks championing WAP have with that track.

In other words people *already* flip shit about the very crass and dehumanizing themes in male-produced hiphop; when these themes are appropriated into female-produced hiphop *and countless woke progressives are tripping over themselves to laud it as amazing and awesome and the epitome of triumphs of all feminism* those same people seem utterly unable to think of any reason why they and the song might get some criticism other than ""they must hate strong black women because of colonialism and Trump.""

Again... *what the fuck, guys?*

I don't get it. If a man had made a parallel track it might have already been subject to harsh critiques for being so misogynistic; if it had simultaneously been widely *praised* for that misogyny it would have drawn even harsher criticism, which is exactly what seems to have happened here.

I'm also rather flabbergasted by the mental gymnastics and doublethink employed to complain that ""Black female artists in hip-hop are often degraded and hypersexualized"" or that ""our bodies are hypersexualised and plastered everywhere"" *while simultaneously heaping an astounding amount of praise on a video and song that degrades and hypersexualizes female bodies.* Fuck, that video is raunchy enough to be softcore porn. It almost invariably far surpasses any of the ""hypersexualization"" you'd see on beer billboards or in car commercials or on any superbowl cheerleading squad or in any film raked over the coals for having a ""male gaze.""

All in all it seems to me that far from empowering women or fighting against objectification or being the hallmark of modern feminism all WAP has done is sink to the lowest of the most egregious lows in all those regards, encouraged a bunch of people to wax over how awesome that is, and then have those same people act totally shocked when they get some pushback for it.

CMV: Any person the age of 25 or older should not be denied a tubual ligation or vasectomy if they request one.,11153,1800,2020-04-29 00:43:55,"It's a common occurrence for men and women seeking a  vasectomy or tubual ligation to have their request denied, even if they are in their late twenties or early to mid 30s.

My view is that whether they already have children or not, no person should be denied a sterilization procedure if they are aged 25 or older.

The reason I say 25, is because that is the age that your frontal lobe is fully formed. And becuase of that you are able to make rational decisions. By the age of 25+, you have a third of your life behind you. You have been an adult for nearly a decade, and have had plenty of time to think about what you want or don't want in life, including if you do or don't want children. Therefore a person in their mid to late twenties is very sure of their decisions, even if it's a decision to have a permanent sterilization procedure.",1

"CMV: ""Demilitarize the police"" makes more sense as a slogan than ""defund the police""",11064,787,2020-08-31 14:22:00,"The classic rationale for defunding the police is that they shouldn't need armored vehicles and the latest military gear to enforce law and order. Sure, but the vibe of ""defund"" means that you are going to restrict police's access to *money* in general - money that can be spent on training for nonlethal deescalation methods. Clearly we are not as concerned about the police's access to public *funds* in general as we are of the *manner* in which they spend those funds. Would we not want a police department that splurges on educating their officers on saving lives?

A second rationale is that police aren't supposed to do the jobs of social workers or therapists. Maybe, but we can already see that in places like the UK and [South Korea](https://news.yahoo.com/south-korea-could-teach-america-194200523.html), police officers are entirely capable of being friendly neighborhood guardians that are able to work closely with the community while still retaining an authority role.

This of course doesn't take into consideration that perhaps the police *need* to be militarized to deal with armed violence in certain communities. Perhaps in that case, a demilitarization of American *society* at large is in order.

CMV: taxpayers and the general public should never contribute money in financing new sports stadiums - that should be 100% on the owner.,10687,708,2017-11-22 00:32:52,"It's no secret - owners of sports teams are usually ultra wealthy, sometimes with billions in net worth. With many local economies struggling and the poor in dire need of resources, cities and states are spending hundreds of millions helping rich owners build stadiums.

For example, Cobb county in Georgia cut off funding for local parks so it could contribute to a new stadium for the Atlanta Braves. I understand that sports teams and stadiums provide economic benefits (jobs, local shops/bars, other sales, etc.), but studies repeatedly show that the economic benefits rarely make up for these huge expenditures on stadiums.

It's a fiscally irresponsible use of limited local and state funds. If the government stops contributing to sports stadium financing, owners will still build these stadiums, and cities/states will free up hundreds of millions in tax revenue to spend where it is truly needed. ",1

Perhaps I worded my original title too negatively, because I don't care that much. What my overall point was, was that I don't buy into the hype. /edit***

The most common arguments I see in support of seeing these remakes produced have been: 1. Makes me nostalgic. 2. It’s what we love but made with better effects / production value. 3. It’s like a Shakespeare play, we haven’t seen *this* version of X story. And here’s why I think each of those arguments completely fails:

1. Yeah, that’s exactly the point. Disney KNOWS it makes you nostalgic and that’s why they’ve chosen these properties. Not because they want to create greater art than the original, but because they know they have a guaranteed market before they even start pre-production.

2. This argument, to me, is just all kinds of infuriating. The Transformers films had “better effects” than the TV show. Doesn’t mean they weren’t steaming piles of garbage. Surprise surprise, one of the most powerful and wealthiest corporations in all history can make a technically competent product. I bet I could make a halfway decent movie if I had several billion dollars. Not to mention - was anybody watching the original Lion King in theaters and thinking, “Wow, this is great but I wish all the lions were photorealistic and impossible to distinguish by their faces so we have to rely on their voices.” The medium of 2D animation worked so well for those films. Why spend millions and millions of dollars remaking them with *different* animation? (Answer: they know people will pay to see it.)

3. I think all the changes they have typically made between the original and the modern remakes have been 100% for the worse from my standpoint but 100% for the safer from a marketing standpoint. E.G.- Instead of the Beast from Beauty and the Beast being a **Beast**, he’s like... a tall muscly guy with a hairy face. In the cartoon he was an actual monster, not unlike a bearwolf hybrid. But this was more palatable in the 3D animation medium to marketers. 

Reddit post submissions are character-limited and I’m not that eloquent or intelligent so I’ll stop here but for any more context regarding my opinions, check out any of Lindsay Ellis’ videos about new Disney remakes (particularly her Beauty and the Beast review) as I agree with almost everything she brings up.

"CMV: Taxes are not equal to theft, they are the cost to of being a part of society.",10515,2471,2018-12-04 20:10:12,"Firstly I just want to clarify that my view is held for free and democratic countries, I understand that this view might not be true for all countries.

I often hear the argument that taxes are immoral because taxation is theft. Taxation is theft because you have to pay your taxes or people with guns put you in a cage. This is presented as if there is no other option. However, if you wanted to, you could go out in the wilderness and sustain yourself, build your own house, live outside of society. Anyone who does this wouldn't be making any money and therefore wouldn't pay any taxes but would be foregoing all of the privileges of being a part of society.

One might then make the argument that the taxes that you pay might be used for things that you don't want them used for. This is however not criticism towards taxation but rather a political issue.

They’re basically reinforcing the mindset they’re opposed to: it’s what person’s skin color or gender happens to be that matters, and it’s okay to make generalizations based on that. 

You could say that historically men have oppressed women and white people have oppressed other races, and continue to do so, and that that makes it justifiable. But are you not basically doing a Hitler then? It’s the group the individual happens to be born apart of and their ancestors that matters, not their own personality and actions.

CMV: the anime community is the reason why most normal people can't bring them self to watch anime,10153,1094,2020-05-17 07:40:22,"As a teen I watched anime (I'm a twenty year old on reddit it sould be self explanotary). After a while I started to seek out people and communities on the internet that would share that interest. And one of the very first things I saw was a guy talking about how good pedofilia in anime was. The worst part is that most comments supported him in his belief.

There are a lot of stereotypes that relate to anime watchers or at least nerds in general, and the anime community does nothing to separate them self from it. I can remember a video by some big anime youtuber (I don't remember his name but he had a few hundred thousand subscribers) that was basically him talking about how drawing porn of underage girls was okay because they were just drawings. 

But let's not talk about pedofilia so much. So, a lot of anime fans are really sexist, like actually to a ridiculous extent. Anime is generally targeted towards teen boys so it doesn't make that much effort to develop or explore female characters (keep in mind that I'm not talking about every single show, I'm just saying that it is defintly a common thing). So a lot of anime fans treat woman like (most) anime treats it's female characters, that is to say with little to no respect. For specific examples just suggest that your are a girl on one of the numerous message boards, you will be floded with ever flavour of sexism there is.

The last problem doesn't seem like the worst, but it essentially creates ever other problem. The *elitism*.  There are many kinds of elitism that anime fans like: ""my favorite show is better than yours"", ""you are enjoying/not enjoying an anime I dislike/like and there for I a a better person"",  ""you are not allowed to watch this specific show because (something sexist/rasist most probably)"", and of course ""As if you would even understand"". I feel like I don't have to go in depth with this one, the over the top examples show exactly how I feel.

The problem is that I like Anime, I'd even would co side my self a fan/web if not for the community. And I'd love to recommend shows like Evangelion, Beastars, cowboy Beebop, fullmeatl alchemist: Brotherhood, JoJo's etc. But I know that I will get the weird looks from them. 

To clarify I am not saying that every single anime fan is like this, just that a majority is like that. I know that the Lou.d minority allways makes the entire group look bad, but in this case it's often hard to find people who are not exactly like the weeb stereotypes.

Edit: okay, I had a lot of conversation with lots of people (never expected for this to get so big overnight). So writing a comment would be pretty pointless since I generally agree with you. I also think that it is because of anime it self rather than just the community that most people are turned off by .

I'd also like to say that Beastars, whole extremely good in my opinion,  is a really bad example of an anime that you could recommend to an average person LoL.
I also forgot to mention that I'd already consider most anime to be not that good. Not that the people who watch it are bad, but that the show them self make me cringe.

Edit 2: I feel like I learned quite a bit on the topic, and I discovered a plethora of reasons why people don't like anime (I know it sounds silly). Many people don't like animation, many people find anime to be too over the top, many anime courses people to become  these shitty fans rather then the opposite, sometimes it's just ignorance and not wanting to read subtitles/watch a foreign film, I also now realise that I was talking about a small vocal minority rather than the larger whole. And while I love to argue more (a big majority of you were kind and understanding while discussing) I have switched my view point so there isn't really a point to it. So I'm not going to respond to further arguments, I will also give deltas to people who persuaded me. Thanks.",1

"CMV: Religious american conservatives / right wingers obsession with capitalism and other ""amercian values"" is incompatible with their nearly fundamentalist take on ""Christianity""",9932,745,2020-10-04 00:58:19,"I'm gonna focus on some key principles that I think are important in Christianity, but are basically ignored by some ""religious"" Amercian conservatives when they argue against things like healthcare, welfare, immigration, or in favor of guns or military intervention and death penalty (punishment in general). I'm genuinely interested in how the worldview of these people is. 



The main thing I base my assumptions on are known ""facts"" about Jesus himself / how he is characterized and how he should be a role model for Christians. Everyone knows, that he is supposed to be nice, peaceful, selfless, altruistic, helping others and not interested in financial gain or profit (I believe he was quoted in saying something like ""don't praise the money""). 


So then, if you praise this person and act like you live according to his standards, why would you be so obsessed with bashing every government program, that is about helping poor people? They not only reject any step in that direction, they also enthusiastically argue against it. How can you justify the ""everybody on his own"" attitude, that people who get sick either die or become homeless because of hospital bills, and blame them for their life choices, instead of trying to set up a system that would help them? Even if it would mean that some amount of the money you worked for would go to somebody else, shouldn't you as a religious person be okay with it? Wouldn't it be fitting your narrative of having tried to do the noble thing? 



Another issue is the tribalism that you find in these communities, where there is prejudice and scepticism if non white people are immigrating to their country, not only because letting in immigrants seeking a better life would be helping others (which would totally be a ""Jesus"" thing to do) but also because Jesus himself probably wasn't white, he was middle eastern, so how do they justify their narrow focus on people with european ancestry, when their ""role model"" wasn't that?



The next topic is their stance on guns and military intervention. I assume that Jesus would have been a pacifist, so why do you never hear those people complain about military spending and all the interventions they are doing? Do they think Jesus would be in favor of going to war with a country like Vietnam or having coup d'etats in South Amercia? Correct me if I'm wrong but as far as I know they are mostly in favor of military operations of the US and are very sceptic about people who critique anything relating to the ""troops"" right? And what is with the obsession with guns in their culture, do they think that Jesus would be a ""gun guy"" and a NRA supporter? That he also would talk happily about how home invaders deserve instant death and how important these tools are, which only have the purpose of hurting / killing? Regardless,of how you judge the home invader situation, I think as a ""religious"" person you shouldn't be that enthusiastic about homicide, no matter how much the person deserved it or how much you thought it's justified, even if it is necessary for your survival, the way some people talk about this with this non mercy attitude as if they are just waiting to shoot someone is completely the opposite of Christianity.


My last point is their stance towards punishment / death penalty. It's obvious what the contradiction in regards to the death penalty would be, but also the ""punishment over rehabilitation"" stance that they take feels so wrong, do you really think that, for example Jesus as a judge would be okay with locking up somebody for stealing as much as possible instead of trying to rehabilitate this person?  Why would you as a christian put revenge over forgiveness, I'm not even a christian and I think it would be obvious which one is the christian way and which not, so why do these people dont see it?




In summary, I believe that these people don't really care about Christianity, they use it when it fits them but abandon it when it would do something that doesn't fit their ""amercian"" narrative, because in my opinion these contradictions are too big to ignore, so either you are intentionally ignorant or they don't really believe in Christianity",1
"CMV: The biggest issue facing the LGBTQ community is itself, and it’s full of toxic, non inclusive, insecure people that gatekeep personality and sexuality.",9874,1025,2020-04-12 13:53:48,"I’m a bisexual man that tends to lean more towards guys, and in the past few days can recount multiple separate negative interactions I’ve had with other gay guys / girls. Obviously this is a small sample size below, but Ive had more negative experiences with LGBTQ people than positives. As I’ve been an open member of this community for more than a year and have made many gay friends / acquaintances, I feel I have fair grounds to comment on its toxicity. These are the three most recent experiences I’ve had and the issues I have with them:

1) Extreme body shaming / bullying — this is a big one. I’ve suffered from anorexia in my life and am currently 6’3, muscular and sitting at 210~ lbs. I was in a discord call with a couple people for league clash tonight (one gay) while we start posting pictures of ourselves comparing ourselves to League of Legends champions. Due to my hairstyle, I posted myself next to Sett. I was immediately told by the gay guy that I look nothing like “sett daddy” and was called fatty and told to “tone up and drop some more pounds.” Unoffended at this point, I informed him I used to be 300 lbs with no muscle, until I was bullied into developing anorexia and only recovered like 6 months ago. His response was “should’ve kept going, you ain’t anywhere near a snack rn.” This cut pretty deep, especially when the community preaches “inclusivity.” 

2) I’m apparently a fake gay if I’m bisexual and use it for sympathy, and I’m not allowed to be “straight acting” — An IRL acquaintance I was speaking to during a zoom meeting noticed an LGBT flag hanging in the back of my room. She exclaimed “OMG u/speculatory I had no idea you were gay!” And I clarified “well actually no, haha, I’m bisexual.” I was then bombarded with accusations of “cultural appropriation” and “sympathy seeking” as I was “clearly a straight man from how I act.” Again, it seems odd for a community that is supposed to be all inclusive to degrade me for how I act and who I love. 

3) EXTREME sexualization / gay is a personality trait — During the same clash game as in #1, one of my close friends had his little brother (8 years old) in the room and was playing League on speakers since he had to watch him. The gay guy died in lane, and starts moaning and saying “this rengar just raped my boy pussy oooh” and other stuff. My close friend tells him to shut up because his 8 year old brother is in the room and gay guy immediately calls me friend a “homophobic fuckboy” and says he’s probably “closeted” and should come over and try some “boy pussy.” At this point my close friend left the call and gay guy resumes with his extremely hyper sexualized remarks during a video game. There’s a fine line between being yourself and just being extremely vulgar to the point where your presence offends and shocks a group of 20 year olds. 

As I’ve said, these aren’t one time occurrences — similar situations to those above have happened at least half a dozen times each to me personally from different people. I can’t say I’m proud to be part of a community that is built entirely on drama, sex, and appearance.",1
CMV: Removing TV episodes or movies from streaming because of racist content does nothing to combat racism and only serves to shield the creators’ brand.,9856,446,2020-06-29 02:30:55,"EDIT: Y’all actually went and changed my view. While I do think there needs to be a legal resource for accessing these episodes digitally just in the interest of transparency, it should only exist for research purposes. The episodes should be taken out of popular circulation because the risk of people seeing and absorbing the ideology is too high. I forget that new people discover shows like 30 Rock every day, and may not question the content. 
END OF EDIT 

This is something that I would actually like to change my mind about, but I just can’t bring myself to because I really don’t understand it.

This is spurred on by the removal of a few episodes of *30 Rock* and *The Golden Girls* from all streaming. I don’t really care about what happened with *Gone With the Wind*, I think they actually did the right thing there by adding a disclaimer instead of removing the film altogether.

This country has a long and pervasive history of racist media, we all recognize this. We likely haven’t seen the end of racist media either, it’s going to happen again with something very popular in the future. Those episodes of *30 Rock* aired, were beloved by millions of people, won Emmys, and were racist. We can’t ignore that. Removing them from *all* digital platforms feels more like an attempt to protect Tina Fey, Robert Carlock and Jane Krakowski than it does an actual constructive effort to improve media. 

The episodes should be available for the public so they can see what the creators did and recognize how they’ve been complicit in racist media. Putting a disclaimer or content warning on the episode would be a much better way to communicate how your mind has changed. 

*Or*, if they’re really that ashamed, take the entire show down. By removing select racist content but allowing other episodes to stay, Tina Fey is continuing to profit off *30 Rock*’s legacy, one that was built using racism. Allowing people to enjoy and support *30 Rock* without acknowledging it’s racist history is an attempt to absolve future fans of guilt and coddle them, assuring them that their problematic fav isn’t actually problematic. It’s not productive for the people who love the show *or* anyone hurt by it.",1
CMV: Abortion is the most humane option in the aspect of an unwanted child in any scenario,9795,2021,2020-07-14 10:50:53,"I know there is a lot of debate between pro life or pro choice. However, none of them sound like a ""pro child"" option to me.

When someone is debating abortion, another huge percentage is debating for reasons that are contributors on their and the unborn child's life. Whether it be financial, political, or an unsafe environment. Very doubtfully, are they trying to make this decision with themselves due to them wanting to ""end"" a human life.

Yet, you have people having IVF, surrogates, or contributing YEARS of their life to produce a child. None of which sound completely natural or fair to me. I personally support all of these, but why is abortion more unnatural. So if Prolife is saying we need to take away abortion to keep life ""more normal"" or 'more like god entailed"" than they must push for a natural conception. Heck, they should push for a natural birth as they didn't have our advancements.

Countless self aware human beings are being subjected to a life that another soul already deemed unpleasant for themselves, but unable to look after the human to come within them. Where is the justice for the child to come unwilling into this life?

I recently heard the news about the [supposed whistleblower who alleges mass hysterectomies are occurring at an ICE Detention Center](https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/like-an-experimental-concentration-camp-whistleblower-complaint-alleges-mass-hysterectomies-at-ice-detention-center/). Obviously we don’t yet know how truthful these claims are, but regardless of their accuracy, but that itself is another problem: that we don’t know. We should be able to know exactly what is going on in these places so that we could confirm either that there are problems or that things are fine. All of these records regarding what goes on in places like this, including the way people are treated, medical records, how facilities are run, etc. should be open to the public. Journalists should have mostly free access to tour the facilities. This shouldn’t just be for detention centers. That’s just one example. Other normal jails and prisons should have to be just as transparent.

Of course, I’m willing to acknowledge the following exceptions:

&#x200B;

1. The identities of the individual prisoners/detainees.
2. Information that would specifically allow for easier break-ins or escapes.
3. Any information found in investigations/interrogations by the facility that would compromise said investigations should it be released (ex. information a cop gets from interrogating a detainee, information received at Guantanamo Bay from a terrorist that is necessary for national security).

CMV: Unpaid internships contribute to class barriers in society and should be illegal.,9543,679,2018-12-11 05:23:56,"The concept behind unpaid internships sounds good, work for free but gain valuable work experience or an opportunity for a job.

The interns from poor backgrounds have to spend energy working a second job, yet the privileged interns who have money already don't have to work a second job and can save that energy and channel it into their internship.

CMV: the big bang theory is the worst popular tv show of the last 20 years (at least),9541,918,2020-09-20 08:14:10,"this may seem subjective, but i think there are enough objective reasons that the big bang theory(bbt) is terrible. for some reference, [here](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls095465155/](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls095465155/) is a list of some very highly rated tv shows from the past couple decades. deadwood, breaking bad, sopranos, it's always sunny... some real high quality stuff. quality obviously isn't always directly reflected in ratings, however. in terms of popularity and viewership, bbt has been consistently the [top](https://bestlifeonline.com/most-watched-tv-moments-2018/?nab=0&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) [program](https://ew.com/tv/2018/05/31/top-50-most-watched-shows-2017-18-season/) of the [year](https://www.tvinsider.com/241950/top-50-most-watched-tv-shows-2016-2017-season/), occasionally behind the superbowl and a few other football events. and that is well into its12 year run, 7,8, 10 years in.

establishing bbt's popularity is easy and objective. how to demonstrate its terribleness? it is my opinion that the show is not funny at all, but it is objectively offensive and insulting to basically everyone. not only that, but there is no character growth, mainly because the characters themselves are designed to only be shallow caricatures in the first place. attractive people are dumb sluts(penny, zach), smart people are gawky wierdos who creep out women (all the males on the show), smart women are frumpy wierdos(amy). 

lets go thru the cast real quick:

penny: doesn't even have a last name. is attractive and therefore dumb and promiscuous. has 0 personality, once her relationship is established with leonard she becomes nothing but an obnoxious harpy who hates everything and complains about all of it.

leonard: he is short and smart, therefore weird and awkward. he is obsessed with the girl next door because she is hot, and no other reason. he is a doormat for sheldon, yet for some reason (because the writers said so) he enables him and stays with him. 

sheldon: a complete nightmare of a human being. he is clearly autistic, but it is all just for laughs. no sane person would maintain a relationship of any kind with him, yet for some reason he manages to keep 7 people wrapped around his finger by acting like a child.

howard: smart, so a creepy weirdo. the only character that actually has a bit of an arc, i'll get to that.

raj: smart, so a creepy wierdo. so creepy and weird he literally can't speak to women until alcohol touches his lips. this goes on until the writers realize the show is getting more popular and need a few more women, and they just ""cure"" him.

amy: smart, so a frumpy wierdo. comes out of her shell a little, but doesn't actually develop.

bernadette: gets a phd so must be smart? a weirdo, and controlling shrew, made to be horrible since she is at least moderately attractive.

stewart: not smart, but likes comic books so a creepy wierdo.

so this show has a character or character trait that is portrayed in  a negative light that can offend or at least insult basically everyone. hot girls, smart people, dumb people, men, women, nerds, geeks, autistic people, etc.

trying not to go too long, but [character arc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_arc)): spoiler, this show doesn't have any. sheldon remains his horrible abusive self, despite getting married and having sex. leonard is still an obnoxious whiner obsessed with the hottie who has nothing in common with him. penny is still a dumb, nagging narcissist, amy is still a frumpy wierdo, she just talks more about how she has friends and sex, bernadette is a horrible shrew, and raj is a creepy weirdo. as i mentioned, howard gets a bit of an arc as he actually does become a slightly more real person and less creepy weirdo after getting married. but it is a pretty flat arc. compare this to the arcs in a good show like breaking bad and you see just how pathetic it is that 12 seasons of bbt gives us basically 0 character development.

a relatively minor point, but i will mention it anyway: all the relationships are terrible. sheldon abuses amy constantly (no surprise, he abuses everyone), penny and leonard have nothing in common and spend most of the time complaining about each other to their friends, and howard and bernadette argue about everything, never communicate, and also have nothing in common.

final point: the show is not funny. harder to prove, but when i watch my favorite comedies like 30 rock, parks n rec, the office, scrubs, archer, always sunny, the it crowd, south park, letterkenny, and venture bros i laugh out loud multiple times per episode even after watching them many times. i have seen most episodes of bbt probably thru season 10, over 200 episodes, and i actually laughed 5-6 times total. watch the [no-laugh track edit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKS3MGriZcs) and see that it is not so much jokes as people saying things then pausing for laugh track. compare that with actually funny shows (that usually don't need a laugh track) and you will see that bbt is just not funny.

tldr: big bang theory is not funny, has offensive and shallow characters, yet was incredibly popular. either convince me that it is actually good or that there is another popular show that was even more terrible.

edit: wtf is up with the links?

edit 2: i should have specified that i am only talking about scripted shows, as reality tv is, by definition, complete trash. while no reality tv is as popular as bbt, it is certainly just as bad.",1
"CMV: Making students read Shakespeare and other difficult/boring books causes students to hate reading. If they were made to read more exciting/interesting/relevant books, students would look forward to reading - rather than rejecting all books.",9477,1075,2018-11-28 03:48:05,"For example:

When I was high school, I was made to read books like ""Romeo and Juliet"".  These books were horribly boring and incredibly difficult to read.  Every sentence took deciphering.

Being someone who loved reading books like Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings, this didn't affect me too much.  I struggled through the books, reports, etc. like everyone and got a grade.  But I still loved reading.

Most of my classmates, however, did not fare so well.  They hated the reading, hated the assignments, hated everything about it, simply because it was so old and hard to read.

I believe that most kids hate reading because their only experience reading are reading books from our antiquity.

To add to this, since I was such an avid reader, my 11th grade English teacher let me read during class instead of work (she said she couldn't teach me any more - I was too far ahead of everyone else).  She let me go into the teachers library to look at all of the class sets of books.

And there I laid my eyes on about *200 brand new Lord of the Rings books including The Hobbit.*  Incredulously, I asked her why we never got to read this?  Her reply was that *""Those books are* English *literature, we only read* American *literature.""*

————————

This has been stewing in my mind for a few days now, and it's finally started to p\*ss me off with the blackedout Instagram gimmick today. 

\----------------------

So firstly, I am naturally completely aghast at the recent killing of George Floyd, a view which is almost **completely unanimous** across the Western world. The 'method' and reporting of the riots/protests isn't part of my CMV so I'll avoid ranting about that. 

But what is grinding my gears is the sudden outrage that appears to have suddenly sprung up in the last day or two in countries outside of the US. Floyd was killed on the 25th, the news spread quickly to my home country of the UK, and then the subsequent rioting spread even quicker. It has taken until June for the social media virtue signallers to start point scoring, and within a day, it had caught hold and now everyone single post on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter is fellow white people trying to out-do each other on who can be the most anti-racist. 

The current hot-and-happening trendy thing to do among young people is to go on a protest march. And how else will your friends know that you're not racist unless you blackout your Facebook picture, you Instagram story and your wallpaper at home? Everyone is doing it, you wouldn't want to be uncool, *would you?* 

It's like people simply didn't care that much until their friend, their flavour of the month celebrity or their favourite sports team started posting self-promoting, pat-on-the-back (sl)acktivism. Yes, everyone knows your in solidarity. Everyone is in solidarity, we've seen the video. Once again, the whole Western world is in solidarity by default because someone was just murdered. It's not black and white (pun not intended). I akmost certain that the vast majority of people outside of the US will have seen the news story, thought about how horrifically unjust it was, and then gone back to scrolling through their phones/laptops. 

\-----------------------

That's one half of my annoyance, the media-manifactured outrage around the world. 

And that leads onto my main issue: why is there such a deafening silence when it comes to (arguably for more horrific) actual genocide and repression of ethnic minorities in other countries? I'm mainly referring to the crises of the Rohingya Muslims and Chinese Uighurs, although I have no doubt there's others. Calling these issues 'worse' may be controversial, but I'm not here to sugar coat. 9 unarmed black men were killed by cops in the US in 2019. That's 9 too many, and of course there are deep lying racial issues that go beyond police brutality, but that's hardly comparible to village massacres and concentration camps. 

I firmly believe that the media simply doesn't want us to care about those issues because they're not as attractive to report about compared to heating up the pressure cooker and getting free news stories from a good old percieved race war on the home turf. I can probably count on one hand the amount of Uighur or Rohingya-related news coverage or social media activism I've seen over the years. Because *how are you going to score internet bonus points with your friends when they have no idea who the Uighurs are*, right? The last time I can remember any sort of mass outrage over this kind of issue outside the Western world was the Kony 2012 hysteria, and that only lasted for a week. Why was everyone incensed? Yep, because the media told us it was the cool thing to do at the time. 

A counter argument I've seen to all this is ""well we can't really change \_\_\_\[bad\]\_\_\_ country's mind"", and while this is perhaps true, the same is true for the current situation. The US won't listen to years of pressure from it's own citizens, what the hell makes you think they'll even remotely care about your small protest in New Zealand or the Netherlands, or your random English sports team staging a self-masturbatory PR picture with all the players kneeling? To this, someone will probably reply ""it's all about solidarity, about awareness"". Ok, then surely everyone should want to show solidarity and awareness with the Rohingya crisis if it's that easy. 

I don't even know what to think at this point. Am I annoyed at the currents riots/protests for getting too much insipid support from people who only want to care because it benefits them in some way, or am I more annoyed the other atrocities don't get the time of day in the media because they're not as trendy as *racism, police brutality, and F the system*?

\---------------

Sorry for the incredibly long post, I didn't realise how much I was writing. I probably could've waffled and ranted for many more pages! 

Someone want to change my mind? I'm becoming increasingly cynical day by day and worrying, it's starting to make me turn a bit sour to the whole 'racist police' cause as a whole.

But the main issue I see with these topics is what should be allowed for women to do if they cannot care for a child that may come about from having intercourse with someone. In Politics, as the issues have come up, Republicans have seemed to come to the conclusion that both Birth Control and Abortion are either immoral or a form of murder (I'm stating both because these are the most common arguments I see).

By themselves, I can understand these arguments, I mean I understand wanting to give babies a chance at life, but they also contradict with the fact that Conservatives also generally do not support social welfare programs in general but that opposition also includes not supporting initiatives to help families care for children. There are many different programs different countries have done, such as Maternity Leave, Healthcare reforms centered around birth care, subsidies to assist with childrearing cost, etc... These are usually government forms of assistance, but there is also intense opposition to private attempts to help families with these issues (Planned Parenthood is the first thing that comes to mind, but there are probably other good examples).

So TL:DR, what am I saying. I've noticed that Conservatives do not support Birth Control or Abortion, but also refuse to help cover the costs of the children that result from the lack of access to these, even when families cannot afford the children they are essentially forced to have.

I'd like to see some justification for this, or just some sort of explanation for why they should keep up this mess of contradictions in US politics.

**Edit: I'm just going to say this because its coming up alot in the comments below, what I am getting at is Republicans are generally against interfering with what a person does in their lives, but they seem to violate that in trying to restrict abortion. So I am saying that if they are willing to intefere in someones life because of that, they should be willing to help cover the costs associated with that prevention**

CMV: Euthanasia should be legal because we deserve the dignity of a peaceful death > long term suffering,9292,588,2020-05-25 17:07:18,"In my opinion, adults who are competent (e.g. conscious, doesnt have alzheimers, sober) should be allowed to elect euthanasia as a solution for intense and long lasting suffering. It's more inhumane to make people suffer for years, especially to illnesses like cancer, rather than have a peaceful death on their own terms. 

For non-competent adults (e.g. long term comas, severe alzheimers, otherwise compromised); their caregivers should be allowed to make that choice as well. If the prognosis is continued suffering and deterioration to an eventual death, they should be allowed to elect euthanasia in their care receiver's best interests. 

I think this could extend to children as well. If your child is born with severe disabilities or diseases (e.g. cancer, SMA, born very prematurely), in some cases it would be more moral to put the child to a peaceful death rather than raise them, watch them suffer, and eventually deal with their prolonged death. In some cases, a child might live in a hospital bed their whole life; this isnt a life but rather a parentally enforced existence. I understand this is probably my most contentious point, but I feel strongly about it. 

All aforementioned examples would obviously be counselled and performed by a medical professional.

All in all, we dont choose to come into this life. We might as well get the choice on how we/incapable wards leave it. 

For context: I'm female, atheist, pro-choice, and from the US.

Deltas: 

- All conscious patients should be included in the decision, even if young or severely disabled. In cases of severe disability, the explanation would need to be accessible and comprehensive to the patient's capability levels. I'm still on the fence on the cases like severe alzheimers or mental impairment where they cant make other legal decisions (like will changes or getting a license) and how that would be balanced with their wellbeing

- People with severe mental illnesses/emotional disabilities should be allowed to go through this process as well, under supervision of medical and therapy professionals. Their suffering is real, too.",1
CMV: Comedy should not be exclusively PC. Everyone needs to get poked fun at sometimes. No limits.,9266,1153,2020-07-11 14:41:29,"This all came to a head when Dave Chapelle was getting shit for his netflix ""Sticks and Stones"" special (great foresight on the title). People bitch too much. The show was a thought provoking and fresh change in the sea of boring ""airplane food"" type jokes/routines going around.

* Comedians are the ones that call out the bullshit in our society. Jokes cannot exist without an element of truth, and often reveal to you the fucked up shit we deal with daily. The Humor is only offensive to you specifically, and dragging everyone down because your fragile feelings got hurt is a shitty thing to do. Humor does not give a shit. Please do not have a stick up your ass as this makes you unlikable and a buzzkill imo.
* Comedy is a medium to help us grapple with the complex and often disappointing (depressing/not fun) realities we face in the world, and the PC Police staunching it over trivial things has gone too far and is not helpful. Comedy makes you think about why the joke was funny and the elements of truth and fiction in the joke. People who want to police jokes are the disillusioned ones who dont want to face the truth and the music.

The beauty of comedy is that anything flies for laughs. It is self policing. Its the responsibility of the comedian or joke teller to analyze his audience demographic and based upon that, alter the severity of the joke. If a joke went to far, nobody laughs. And that to me, is beautiful.

CMV.

EDIT:

I urge all to check the delta post. Very good breakdown. Comedians should either shit on everyone by the same amount or delve into controverisal topics and use jokes to explore them with the audience. Bigots pretending to be comedians with their circle jerk audience should not be allowed. If your special focuses on the jewish for the entire hour and only trashes and does not meaningfully explore, its not comedy. Its being a cock. That being said nobody is untouchable, and somebody shouldn't cry and bitch if they were offended from 3 minutes out of a 1 hour show.",1
"CMV: The biggest problem with American politics is viewing people that we disagree with as ""the enemy"".",9147,1682,2017-12-17 03:54:56,"It appears to me that we've gotten to a point where liberals and conservatives hate each other with such passion, that those who disagree with us are seen as the enemy. The Internet, for all of the great it has brought us, has led our society to a state of hyper-polarization. Users can now consume only information that comports with their worldview, and thus, the hatred towards the ""other side"" has grown exponentially. This has led friends, neighbors, family members, and worst of all, Congress, to view those who disagree with them as evil. This has many ramifications in our political discourse, such as a constant state of gridlock.

I can not think of a single issue which prevents our society from moving forward as much as the pervasive attitude that those who disagree with us are ""the enemy"".

"CMV: If Cardi B was a man, we would be boycotting her music and her career would be destroyed",9103,1222,2019-03-28 21:15:05,"Cardi B jusr revealed for no reason at all that she used to DRUG MEN  in order to get them to take her home to have sex with, and then rob them, and that she would also ""trick"" men into sleeping with transwomen.

I am completely outraged and disgusted by this but moreso by the double standard of society that this is making apparent. In the face of a social movement on the scale of MeToo, if this had been a male figure on the same scale of influence and fame as Cardi B there would be absolute outrage from all corners of society, radio stations would refuse to play their music, and the male equivalent of Cardi B would have their life and career be completely over, as well as likely having their victims reveal themselves  and hopefully there would be legal criminal action taken against them.

How us it acceptable for this woman to have acted this way? Why are people treating this horrible abuse of other humans as seemingly a joke? Why are people not as disgusted with this as we have been with, for example, Bill Cosby or perhaps as with the incredibly minor exanple of Aziz Ansari?

This speaks to an absolutely disgusting double standard and shows how little people care of the assault on men by women. I cannot believe Cardi B is just going to get away with this. Please explain to me why the same outrage over every other case of this sort of abuse that has recently come to light is entirely absent here? Please maybe give me some hope that some action is being taken and that this multi millionaire isn't just going to be able to get away with this atrocity scott-free? I really thought we were past this....

"CMV: We are going to have to come up with a better term than ""LGBTQIA+""",9008,1967,2020-07-08 22:10:03,"When I was young, the word ""gay"" meant anyone with a same-sex orientation. Then ""gay"" acquired more of a connotation of just gay men, so instead of just ""gay rights"",  people started referring to ""gay and lesbian rights"" to be more inclusive. Then, I still remember the day in college that our on-campus chapter of GLAAD was renamed BGLAAD to include people with a bisexual orientation. Shortly after that, because the discrimination trans people face is similar in a lot of ways, we shifted again to ""LGBT"", which is still pretty easy to say and most people, even those outside the community, knew what all the letters stood for and what groups they represented. 

But now, it's evolved to ""LGBTQIA+"", which is only three syllables shorter than ""antidisestablishmentarianism"", the longest word in the English language. Most people saying it bog down around the Q as they struggle to remember how the rest of it goes, and even when they get there, they're not exactly sure what the letters stand for or what groups they represent. Worst of all, I'm sure we're still not representing everyone who feels like part of the community. Are we just going to keep on adding letters indefinitely? And to me, at least, the current term isn't egalitarian within the movement; rather, the groups listed first are always included, while those at the end have a ""tacked-on"" feel and are sometimes omitted, implying they are less important. In a community so damaged already by marginalization, wouldn't a more egalitarian term be better?

One term I've heard proposed is ""GSM"", for ""Gender and Sexual Minorities"", which accomplishes a lot of the goals here but which has never really caught on. But, I think we're now at that breaking point where we have to come up with something better than what we currently have. Change my view?",1
CMV: Transwomen (transitioned post-puberty) shouldn't be allowed in women's sports.,8962,2021,2020-09-16 18:13:05,"From all that I have read and watched, I do feel they have a clear unfair advantage, especially in explosive sports like combat sports and weight lifting, and a mild advantage in other sports like running.

In all things outside sports, I do think there shouldn't be such an issue, like using washrooms, etc. This is not an attack on them being 'women'. They are. There is no denying that. And i support every transwoman who wants to be accepted as a women.

I think we have enough data to suggest that puberty affects bone density, muscle mass, fast-twich muscles, etc. Hence, the unfair advantage. Even if they are suppressing their current levels of testosterone, I think it can't neutralize the changes that occured during puberty (Can they? Would love to know how this works). Thanks.

Edit: Turns out I was unaware about a lot of scientific data on this topic. I also hadn't searched the previous reddit threads on this topic too. Some of the arguments and research articles did help me change my mind on this subject. What i am sure of as of now is that we need more research on this and letting them play is reasonable. Out right banning them from women's sports is not a solution. Maybe, in some sports or in some cases there could be some restrictions placed. But it would be more case to case basis, than a general ban.",1
"CMV: The current US bailouts for all the large companies is unfair to both the US taxpayers, small businesses, and every company that responsibly managed their money in recent years",8799,661,2020-05-18 03:34:08,"Recently, the US government has given out trillions in bailouts to the airline, retail, hospitality, etc industries. However, as a tax payer, I'm outraged that these large corporations are getting these handouts from the government and getting rewarded for their greedy behavior. The bank bailouts of 08 made me sick and I can't believe we're doing this again. Millions of Americans lost their jobs and their homes due to the bank's irresponsible and illegal behavior, and yet all these bankers made out with millions.

Take the airline industry for example. 96% of their Free Cash Flow was spent on stock buybacks this past decade. These C-suite executives and investors made millions off this type of behavior despite not creating any type of value for both the company and for their employees. If your company can't last a few months of stagnant revenue, you shouldn't be spending all that money on buybacks and dividends. Especially when a large reason these companies found so much excess money in the last couple years was an egregious gifted tax cut from the government. Sure no one could have foreseen the current environment, but nearly every economist was predicting a recession within the next few years. They should have prepared for some type of downturn. 

Furthermore, this punishes the companies that actually acted responsibly with their capital. In normal circumstances, this would be their opportunity to gain market share and even buy up some of the failing companies. Instead, they are robbed of this opportunity. The way our market works is that feedback is all seen through the lens of risk and reward. When a company decides to spend almost all of their profits on buybacks, they are taking the risk that a black swan event in the future can cause bankruptcy. Now we are removing the incentive for prudent decision making for companies. What's to stop companies of only acting recklessly since they know the government will always bail them out?

Lastly, lots of small businesses are going bankrupt everyday. Where are their bailouts? Why should large companies with every advantage in the world be given this lifeline for acting so irresponsibly, when normal everyday people struggling to get by are not allotted this same opportunity.

Before anyone says it, I understand bailouts are not free money. They're a loan by the government. But the interest rates are typically much lower than they would command in the free market. The government should either charge a high interest rate to compensate for that risk, or inject money into these companies through equity investments that could be put in a blind trust. At least in this scenario, the bailout is seen through the lens of a prudent investment. It's also pricing in the risks of investing in these companies since we never know what will happen to them in the future. If they don't want it, they can find someone else to give them money or go bankrupt. It's not like these companies will just disappear, there will be a buyer somewhere out there. 

No one is ENTITLED to a low interest loan from the government, especially these mega corporations who barely pay above minimum wage for their lowest employees while constantly upping the C-suite's compensation. By handing out bailouts that actually reflect the risk for these companies, we can actually punish the C-Suite and investors who squeezed every bit of profit out of the company during good times since these deals will negatively affect the stock price. The bailouts in its current form reward the CEOs and investors who already cashed out in the past couple of years pushing for buybacks and increased dividends.",1
"CMV: People who object to donating their organs after they died should be right at the bottom of the list, when it comes to receiving an organ.",8799,962,2020-07-16 01:59:42,"I frequently hear of people who don't want to donate their organs after they died, because of religious reasons or because ""it feels creepy"". Same goes for donating the organs of close relatives who left no clear orders for this case.

The thought of having your organs removed may be scary and okaying the removal of a loved one's organs even more. But if you can't come to terms with that, you don't have the right to benefit from others making an grown up decision. The same goes of course, if your god forbids the removal of organs. If your believe is more important to you than saving one or several persons lives, then your god should better protect you from organ failure.

Minors should, of course, be exempt insofar as they should receive organs independent from their parents choices.

Of course, organs shouldn't be thrown out, if there's no ""deserving"" recipient, but they should only go to non-donors, if there are no adequately compatible recipient available who would have donated themself.

* It seems like recent election outcomes reflect these polls. ~~The last four out of five Republican candidates lost the popular vote.~~ Democrats have won the popular vote in 6 out of the 7 most recent general elections. That means, with the exception of Bush in 2004, Republicans haven't won popular vote since 1988 (32 years ago).
* In addition, it seems very likely that Trump will lose the popular vote again in 2020 \[[538](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/) (88%), [Economist](https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president?utm_campaign) (97%)\].
* In 2018 mid-term elections, [Democrats won 18 million more votes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/11/06/us/elections/results-senate-elections.html) in the Senate election, but Republicans still gained 2 more seats and retained their majority. Now I understand the Senate is designed to protect smaller states, but winning despite having 18 million less popular votes feels like too much protection.

Despite all this Republicans have been able to cut taxes, gut the Affordable Care Act without providing any alternative, and cut funding to the EPA. Republicans have no interest in marijuana legalization. There will most likely be a Republican super-majority in the Supreme Court, putting legal abortion in jeopardy.

The fact that Republicans currently hold power in the Supreme Court, Senate, and Presidency despite their lack of popular votes and the unpopularity of their policies shows that America is a tyranny of the minority.

EDIT: Thank you so much for the gold!

I keep seeing the same arguments over and over again, so I am going to start addressing some of them here.

*America is not a direct democracy, so popular opinion doesn't matter. This is how the government was originally designed.*

* I agree that America isn't and shouldn't be a direct democracy. All I am arguing for is curbing back the power smaller states have.
* For example, the ratio of representation between California and Wyoming in the Senate is 1-1, despite the fact that the population ratio is 68-1. I don't think it is unreasonable to advocate for it being something closer to a 10-2 ratio. This would still give Wyoming disproportionate power in the Senate.
* We could also make electoral vote allocation more proportional, instead of the fully winner-take-all system we have right now. This could even benefit Republicans because there are a lot of conservatives in blue states like California and New York that don't really have a voice in the general election.
* While I believe we can use the original intent of the Founders and their design of government as a guide, I don't think we need to follow it religiously. We have made changes to the government in the past, and we can make changes to the government again.
* If the disproportionate power of smaller states is severely undermining the will of the people, I think it is reasonable to propose changes to certain institutions.

*Support for something in polls isn't support for something to actually be enacted.*

* I think the way the majority of Americans are voting shows that the support for these policies extends beyond polling.

*By definition tyranny requires cruelty, so America is not a tyranny.*

* I will work from this definition from Oxford: cruel, unreasonable, OR arbitrary use of power or control.
* I believe the disproportionate power of smaller states is unreasonable and arbitrary in its current state.

*The polls are flawed.*

* I am not a stats or polling expert so I don't know how to resolve this in a convincing manner. It is very possible that the polling is flawed because of their population size, demographics, the way their questions are asked, etc.
* That being said, most of the polls I cited are from Gallup and Pew Research, which are widely regarded as reliable.",1

CMV: All public restrooms that contain only a single toilet should be gender neutral,8714,710,2019-01-24 00:01:58,"I was discussing this with a friend of mine when we are at an ice cream parlor. The parlor had a male and a female bathroom,  but both only contained a single toilet and sink meaning that it could only be used by one person at a time no matter what (Barring small children who still need their parents to help).

Both she and I saw no reason for them to be labeled, and that them being gender neutral would have no adverse effects.

But I might be wrong. I am only looking at this from my limited view point.

cmv: “All white people...” opinions are challenging for white BLM allies,8703,1561,2020-06-21 21:36:58,"Let me make this clear at the beginning: black lives matter. Black lives should always have mattered. This is not the opinion I would like to discuss changing. 

Lately I’ve been struggling, as a white person, to read tweets/opinion pieces where people of color lump all white people together in a negative statement. Today I saw someone tweet a picture of a trump rally with a caption to the effect of “it doesn’t matter how much info comes out about the president being a scumbag, white people will always support the oppression of blacks no matter what”. 

I know they’re not talking about allies like me, but I still feel hurt and challenged by these statements. No matter how much I protest, donate, and spread awareness, some people will still see that I’m white and associate me with people who oppose my view. The most aggravating part of this for me is that even expressing that statements like these are challenging poses me as someone who isn’t fully committed to the cause, and makes it easy to be targeted and labeled as a racist white person. I understand that black people have experienced much worse for hundreds of years, but I haven’t found a way to not be bothered by this on my own.

CMV: It is not unfair to expect your SO to (at least attempt to) maintain some form of physical attractiveness throughout the relationship.,8504,964,2020-08-10 18:39:36,"I struggled with the title a bit, so read on if it is unclear. 

This view of mine stems from a debate I got into with a friend of mine, let's call her Sam. We were discussing a mutual friend of ours, who we'll call John, who after years of being with his SO broke up with her 'because she got fat' (Sam's words). 

Now at first glance, yes that may be the heart of what happened. But of course, deep down a lot of other factors were at play: John's SO getting fat was a gradual process which reflected her level of comfort in a relationship she thought was stable and set for life. She had done all the hard work - winning over John - and now that they have moved in together, and had discussions about marriage and possibly kids, she (subconsciously or not) thought she could finally 'let it go' and not have to try so hard. As blissful as that may be, and for some perhaps the goal of a long-term relationship, I think this mentality is fundamentally flawed and horribly unfair on John. Yes, people change as they grow. And yes, when you marry or form a long-term relationship with someone you accept that. But personality change over a lifetime is for the most part beyond one's control; deciding to stop exercising, drinking a bottle of wine every night after work and over-indulging on biscuits while watching too much TV on the sofa as part of a daily ritual is not. It's a sign of resignation. 

John is now in a difficult position. He fell in love with the beautiful girl he met at that party. She had a wonderful figure and clearly took care of her body. Her sexiness lit a fire under him, and their chemistry was both physical and mental. As they started dating he respected the effort she went to stay in good shape. And she clearly didn't do it just to 'get the guy', it was for herself too: She was proud and confident of how she looked. Yet over the last couple of years, all of this side of her had slowly disintegrated. She just didn't care anymore. Her lack of caring for herself was in itself unattractive, and John suddenly started having problems in the bedroom too as a result. Yet was he just being shallow? Should he just 'suck it up' and accept this change as normal, and continue in this relationship which he entered under conditions which have now changed without his consent? If he finds her unattractive now after only a few years, what will happen to their relationship in 10 years?

In the end, John did have many discussions with his SO about this. She accepted she had let things go a bit and said she would try harder. But after another 6 months of no change, he decided the best thing was to end it since he didn't feel the same way. And the two parted ways. 

\*\*\*

Now back to my debate with Sam: She was quite offended by John's behaviour. To her, he was obviously a very shallow man and his treatment of his ex-SO was unfair. I, on the other hand, was completely on John's side. When you enter a long-term relationship with someone, especially a marriage, you make an agreement to try your best to love and be loved by that person for as long as you can. You enter the agreement based on terms at that point in time: ""I love you, my SO, because of who you are and who I predict you will become"". Yet when your SO essentially breaks this contract and gives up being the person that you fell in love with, your feelings for them are bound to change. This goes for not only personality characteristics and psychological wellbeing but also physical appearance, since no matter how all the romanticists like to spin it, it is a culmination of all of these components which make up *you* as a person. 

And they way he dealt with it was also very fair and full of communication. He didn't just dump her suddenly. He expressed his feelings to her, gave her a chance to think it over, and adapt it should she chose to. She didn't and so for both of their best interests in the long run, they split up. 

My fundamental view is then, that it is not unfair to expect your SO to keep working (for lack of a better word) for your love, and vice versa. Whether that be maintaining their physical appearance (as best as time will let you of course) or maintaining common interests so you don't hate each other in 20 years time, for example. It therefore *is unfair* for your SO to 'give up' and take marriage/long-term relationships as an excuse to stop trying.

I'd love to hear some opinions.

EDIT: this has blown up way more than I anticipated and I’m afraid I’d struggle to reply to everyone at this stage! I really *do* appreciate all the responses, on both sides of the argument and am fascinated by what everyone has to say. As of yet my mind hasn’t been changed but I’ve certainly heard some great arguments. I’ll keep checking in and will respond where I can.

EDIT(ii): I’m going to summarise a really common argument I keep seeing, *”As we get old we all grow and change; Our bodies age; Beauty is temporary; No one can stay physically attractive forever, etc.”*. To respond to this, I wholeheartedly agree and accept that fact. But I accept it as a slow process that takes decades, and in most scenarios happens simultaneously to both partners as they age. In John and his SO’s example I presented above, it happened suddenly within the first few years of their relationship, and it was purely a one-sided change. Again it keeps coming back to differing expectations and values: John’s expectations of a healthy long-term relationship clearly didn’t include giving up all the advantages of an active and healthy lifestyle while he and his partner were still in their twenties, whereas his SO’s expectations were quite the contrary. At this stage, after only two years of living together they were already suffering attraction issues, and the foundations of resentment were forming in their relationship, surely that is evidence enough that their expectations in their relationship did not match, and it would therefore be best for both of them to end it before it got more serious (marriage and kids)?",1

CMV: We shouldn't judge people from history by modern day values.,8258,1100,2020-06-08 03:31:35,"Today a statue of Edward Colston was torn down by protestors because of his involvement in the slave trade. See - [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52954305](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52954305)

The reason he had a statue is due to his philanthropy and historical importance to Bristol. Wording from the plaque on his statue:""Edward Colston (1636–1721), MP for Bristol (1710–1713), was one of this  city's greatest benefactors. He supported and endowed schools,  almshouses, hospitals and churches in Bristol, London and elsewhere.""

More info - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward\_Colston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Colston)

I understand why people are angry and I don't think we should be celebrating bad aspects of the past. Slavery is wrong! However, we shouldn't hide from the past either and I don't think people are wholly good or bad. I think the best way to judge someone is by the context they lived in.

No argument about right or wrong would be complete without mentioning Adolf Hitler. He was an evil person by modern standards, and also by standards of his time (hence the world war to stop him). So monuments to Hitler aren't appropriate even if he also did some good things ([https://www.quora.com/We-all-know-the-evil-that-Hitler-did-What-good-if-any-did-he-do](https://www.quora.com/We-all-know-the-evil-that-Hitler-did-What-good-if-any-did-he-do)).

Colston on the other hand was a slave trader at a time before the Abolition Movement really started in England. Donating money to education, places of worship and the care of the sick/old is probably considered good in any time period or culture. So in his day he would have been seen in a positive light.

&#x200B;

We should judge people by standards of the time they live in, not by the standard of today. Celebrating the good aspects of a historical figure who did wrong by modern day standards is unfair and risks suppressing history. Change my view!

**Edit:**

I wanted to keep this fairly general, but I'll say something specifically on the European slave trade with America. I think people dislike it so intensely because it's still having a lasting effect to this day. I doubt a statue of a Roman would get this level of anger even though they had a huge slave trade. Same goes for the Great Pyramids in Egypt.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

My mind was changed! Thanks everyone, there have been some really interesting discussions on this thread. Thanks for the gold!

While we still need to be careful judging historic figures by modern standards, I think that it can be justified. Here are my new key points when considering something like a public statue:

* Was what they did ok at the time?
* How bad is it by modern interpretation?
* Can the good celebrated by the statue be disconnected from the bad? (In the case of Colston it's a no)
* Time matters, slavery in Colston's time still has a lasting impact. Slavery in Caesar's time, not so much.
* There is a difference between good and great. When examining someone doing something good (i.e. philanthropy) the bad counterbalances this. When someone is considered great it is for something big and possibly unique that changed the course of history.
* Statues and monuments no longer deserving of public praise should be moved to a museum where proper context can be given.",1
"CMV: The Jedi are full of shit and leaning toward the ""Dark"" Side is the way to go.",8222,644,2018-11-12 11:15:40,"I was looking at the Sith and Jedi codes, and it made me realize how full of shit the Jedi are. The Jedi seem to encourage a lack of emotion and strict internal discipline.


Just look at their respective codes.


The Jedi Code:

There is no emotion, there is peace.

There is no ignorance, there is knowledge.

There is no passion, there is serenity.

There is no chaos, there is harmony.

There is no death, there is the Force.


The Sith Code:

Peace is a lie, there is only passion.

Through passion, I gain strength.

Through strength, I gain power.

Through power, I gain victory.

Through victory, my chains are broken.

The Force shall free me.


Now, while certain parts of the Jedi Code, specifically lines 2 and 5, are good, the rest of it seems to be pushing a worldview based on restraint, discipline, and order. Now this in and of itself is fine, but it accomplishes this by restricting the influence of passion. Passion & emotion is the chief governing factor in Humans. Maybe it's different for certain alien species, I don't know.


The Sith, on the other hand, encourage passion. They use it, control it, and gain strength and inspiration from it. This is their strength, but also their weakness. Emotion can grant power, but it can also blind you.


So neither the cold, orderly philosophy of the Jedi nor the reckless abandon of restraint of the Sith are necessarily worth following. Passion should never be without restraint, but the abandonment of it by the Jedi is both unrealistic and harmful to it's members. So while I wouldn't endorse the entirety of Sith philosophy, I would certainly endorse leaning into the ""Dark Side"" more than the ""Light"".

CMV: Changing the race or sex of a comic book character for the sake of diversity is stupid,8010,2264,2020-09-08 03:50:54,"I often see this notion online where when an actor's time is up in a show, movie, or series of movies that the character in question's race or gender should be changed. For example, upon watching the recently released Batman trailer with Robert Pattinson playing Batman, I saw a large group of people in the comments and on twitter suggesting that if the Joker is to be added, he should be played by Lakeith Stanfield (a black actor). Upon reading these people's ideas, I thought to myself what the point of changing a character's race is simply for the sake of diversity when it doesn't align with the portrayal of the character at hand.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm all for having characters on TV or in cinema be any race or gender, so long as the actor playing said character fits the history of the character (e.g. Black panther, Captain marvel, Lucius Fox, etc.). Another example of this issue is the conversation of having an actor such as Idris Elba play James Bond when the character has always been white throughout the 007 movies. Regardless of the race or sex of a character, I feel it's appropriate to match the actor with said race or sex.

"CMV: The proposed wealth tax by Bernie and Warren will positively impact our economy, and Billionaires won’t be able to avoid the tax.",7933,1295,2020-02-18 21:19:26,"I’m looking for reasons to cmv, because I’m definitely no tax or economics expert. I am curious about potential effects a 6% tax rate on billionaires would have and if it would actually be enforced correctly.

One thing I’m reading about is since they can hire the best tax consultants, there will be many loopholes that will keep their net worth from being taxed; for example, how will property’s or other assets be assessed fairly? There are not many comparables to use on mega mansions, so In court they could argue a much lower value. I figure that even a lowball assessed value in a billionaires net worth/estate will still be “good enough” though since someone with 10 billion in assets probably can’t argue all the way down to an assessed value 1 billion, and they’ll still be subject to the wealth tax. 

which goes into another area I’m not familiar with, would they be able to move assets to another country without these taxes? Does Bernie or Warren have a foolproof way of stopping this? These billionaires financial advisors certainly would do the math now if they feel such a policy will come into effect, and if they figure a 6% tax on their wealth would ruin them in a few years, they could move their net worth to another country beforehand (since Im assume moving the wealth would also be taxed after whatever bill passes to stop exactly this?) again, skeptical of loopholes and would like some insight on what they would do in reality. If they could do this, could this end up weakening our economy? 
I really would like some opinions on those who think these taxes won’t work well, or if work as desired, may end up impacting our economy, since reddit echo chambers typically don’t delve into any of the finer details that I feel I need to have an educated opinion.",1
"CMV: The controversy surrounding Liam Neeson's recent interview is wholly irrational, and show's plainly the counterprodictivity of outrage culture.",7926,990,2019-02-06 05:22:02,"For those unfamiliar with the controversy, I'll give a brief overview. Liam Neeson recently was giving an interview about his new movie Cold Pursuit, which is being branded as a very dark comedy with the futility/uselessness of revenge being the main theme. Neeson talks about how the character is ultimately lead into a life of criminality and violence by his thirst for revenge, very explicitly framing this as a negative thing. In being asked by the interviewer how he channels that emotion to play the character, he tells a story. He says 40 years ago, a close friend of his was brutally raped, and in asking about who the rapist was discovered they were black. He then says he went around for a week in black neighborhoods hoping some ""black bastard"" would start a fight with him so he could kill them, any random black person. He then says that when he finally came down from that emotional reaction of wanting revenge, he was shocked and disgusted with the way it had made him behave. He says he had been so ashamed of it that he had never told almost anyone about it up until that point, but that he learned from the experience. This prompted outrage on the internet, with many calling for him to be banned form the Oscars, to be blacklisted by Hollywood, and even to have his Oscar taken away.

This is insane to me. What's the goal of calling out racism and identifying it? So that we all, as a society, may learn from it, grow, and hope to do better moving forward, but also in the hopes that the person being racist will see the error of their ways and change.

In this case you have a man, most famous for playing a historical figure who helped Jews during the Holocaust, who is not expressing racist thoughts and not engaging in racist behavior, but rather is recounting thoughts and behavior from FOUR DECADES AGO and self describing it as shocking, disgusting, and having made him feel ashamed of himself. This is a man who grew up in Northern Ireland while it was at war, where bigotry was commonplace and revenge killings and bombings against Catholics and Protestants happened on a daily basis. Growing up in an environment like that, bigotry is taught as second nature. So, enraged by his sense of revenge, he went out with violent intentions aimed at an innocent group of people because he was taught to think that way. This same man then realized what he was doing was wrong, learned from it, grew from it, and seemingly has spent the rest of his life ashamed that his emotions and upbringing had caused him to think and behaves that way. 

What is it that people hope to accomplish by punishing him? He explicitly recognized that this was horrible, and only brought it up in the context that seeking revenge makes people do horrible things. He has already learned. He's already grown. This isn't even a gotcha moment that someone dug up from his past, he volunteered it as an example of NOT the right way to think or behave. How are we going to say he's racist?

Now some people point to his use of the phrase ""black bastard"" but if you listen in the clip he's describing his thought process at that time. He's clearly speaking as his younger self, and to ascribe that to how he feels today is intellectually disingenuous.

I believe that by seeking to punish a man using his own experiences to teach and display the way that bigotry and anger can make you do awful things, outrage culture is actively getting in the way of having the difficult conversations that need to be had about race.

EDIT: the Reddit app is giving me trouble not loading any comments beyond what I've  already responded  to and I won't be able to respond on a computer for a while. Just wanted to let people know I'm not dodging questions or responses, I'm just literally unable to even see them.

EDIT 2: wow this really blew up while I was asleep, I'll be making an effort to get around to as many responses as I can this morning and afternoon since I'll have access to my desktop.

I do want to add in this edit, both to make it relevant as per the rules but also because I've been seeing a lot of this argument, that some of you need to justify the concept that humans either can't change, or that there is a logical reason to not treat them differently for having changed. Many of you are arguing that essentially nobody should be forgiven for having held racist views or done racist things, no matter how much they've changed, and no matter how badly they feel about it.

To those people I want to ask several questions. Do you think that people can change? If not, why not given that we have mountains of psychological and historical evidence indicating otherwise? Do you think people who have changed should be treated as though they hadn't? If so, why given that in changing they definitionally are a different person than they were? Most importantly, why? What is the advantage of thinking this way? How does never forgiving people help your cause?

I'm of the opinion that if one truly hates racism and bigotry, one has to conduct themselves in a way that facilitates change so that these ideals can be more quickly removed from society. The only way that happens is by creating fewer racists. One mode of doing this is by educating the young, but another is by changing the minds of those who have been taught incorrectly so that they are both one fewer racist and also one more educator of their children to think the right way. In order to change my view you must logically show how it follows that punishing people for being honest about the changes they've made, and for making those changes at all, encourages social progress.

Another thing I'd like many of you to do is provide any evidence that you'd have done better growing up in as hateful an environment as Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Many of you as arguing that because not all people at any given point in time were racist, that to have been conditioned to behave and think a certain way is inexcusable. This to me is logically identical to the arguments made by actual modern racists in the US to justify calling black men rapists and murderers. It ignores everything we understand about psychology and the role nurture plays in developing personality.

Lastly, to clarify since many if you seem patently wrong about this (sorry if that's rude but it's true), I am not, and Neeson himself is not, justifying his past actions. He views them as disgusting, shocking, and shameful. I also view them that way. In explaining the thought process that lead him to take these actions, he is not justifying them, he is explaining them. There is both a definitional, and from the perspective of the listener I believe also a moral, difference between explaining how an intense emotion can lead someone from the wrong type of upbringing to do an awful thing, and saying that the awful thing isn't awful because of the context. At no point have I or Neeson argued that what he did wasn't awful, or that it was justified.

EDIT 3: I'd like to, moderators allowing, make one final edit to a point that I am seeing very commonly and would more easily be addressed here. Though it may not SEEM an important distinction when you are trying to view a man as unforgivable, Neeson didn't hurt anyone not because he didn't encounter any black people, but because none started fights with him. He wasn't roaming the streets looking for any black person minding their own business to beat up and kill, he was hoping to be attacked so that he could feel justified in defending himself. This IS an important distinction for multiple reasons. One, it shows, though still heinous, that even at his worst he was not trying to be a murderer, he was trying to be a (racist) vigilante. Two, it shows very clearly the social bias at the time which is still present today that he figured black people were thugs and criminals so he figured if he just walked around one would give him cause to enact his (again, unjustified and racist) revenge. Three, and most importantly, it is exactly BECAUSE he took this approach instead of killing some random black person that not only was nobody hurt, but that it showed him exactly how wrong he was. It proved plainly that this group of people were not all like his friends rapist, that black people aren't just thugs and criminals, and that it was ""disgusting"", ""shocking"", and ""shameful"" in his own words to behave the way he did. This is implicit in him describing that he learned from the experience, because he realized exactly what he was and what he was doing. In looking to be attacked and not being attacked, he realized how repulsive his actions and thoughts were once the emotion of the moment had faded. To fail to make the distinction between ""he didn't kill a black person because he never saw a black person"" and ""he didn't kill a black person because none attacked him"" is to entirely miss the point of the story that he was trying to make, as well as to factually misrepresent it and to ignore how this event influenced his views to change in the future.",1

As I went through high school, then college, I realized that many people, including me, did not have a proper understanding of how to balance our personal budgets.  Going through my accounting major, I believe that many of the basic skills that I learned in my first intro accounting class would benefit many young adults who are just entering the real world, and that these classes would be just as beneficial if not more so than classes such as history or social studies.  My reasoning for this is that everyone who lives in society has to balance a budget, from the lowest level workers all the way up to the c-suite executives.  These skills could also help students to look at their post school prospective student with a keener eye, such as balancing their chosen major and the school they want to go to relative to the cost and future benefit those majors would bring in their careers.  And if they don’t choose to go to higher education, they can still benefit from the basic book keeping and budgeting skills in their personal lives.

There are already free and certified courses for all types of studies. Rather schools should teach how to better understand what is available online and make sure only accurate and proper information is taken. This will also help students explore on their own and come up with different ideas, not cramming the same paras.

Students should be encouraged to access information on their own and how to do it, this will also make them better understand internet as a whole and all its antiques along with what you can trust and not.

CMV: there should be a maximum age to run for president,7681,428,2020-10-04 14:59:14,"So in the usa we have a minimum age of 35 to run for president. Although i object to that number, i do see the reasoning behind it, ie being too uninformed to be effective. I think equally, if not even moreso, this should apply to a maximum age as well.

Using Joe biden as an example, the man is 34 years past the median age of the state with the highest median age (maine, 43). This is close to double the median at best. 

There is effectively no way the man (or any older candidate) could possibly be in touch with the issues facing most of the country. This is only going to become a larger and larger divide as time goes on and quicker advances in technology create larger gaps of understanding between age groups.

Beyond this, there are more practical reasons such as straight up dying in office from old age. Again using biden as an example, hes less than 1.5years away from hitting the life expectancy of a male in the usa. Obviously a man in such a position would have a higher life expectency than the average, but come on. Its the white house, not a nursing home. Almost no person in his 60s/70s will perform mentally or physically as well as on their 40s/50s.

"CMV: The idea of “white fragility” is racist, isn’t helpful, and just exists to antagonize whites.",7647,2480,2020-07-18 21:19:07,"I’ve seen this idea of white fragility all over Reddit for the past year and I frankly find it deplorable. 

The crux of most of the posts/discussions concerning white fragility follow the basic format of: someone says something racially questionable toward white people, white person says “hey, don’t say that” or “I don’t appreciate that”, then someone calls the white person racist/fragile for not tolerating racism toward them, then the white person defends themselves as not a racist and is subsequently confirmed as a racist.

This person is then called fragile for not tolerating racism toward them and then is deemed racist through the infallible logic of “the only people who have say that their not racist are racists” 

This isn’t a helpful way of thinking because no one should be called fragile or mocked for calling out racist behavior or for defending themselves against slander/libel.

CMV: The United States is on track for an undeclared civil war,7534,929,2020-08-30 14:17:21,"EDIT: Hoisting this up here due to its importance, as I think these terms are far better at explaining what I meant. Instead of **undeclared civil war** read **irregular** or **low-intensity** warfare.

>**Irregular warfare** (**IW**) is defined in [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) joint doctrine as ""a violent struggle among state and non-state actors for legitimacy and influence over the relevant populations.""

Before I begin, I'd like to define what I mean by ~~""undeclared civil war""~~ ( EDIT: see u/Anarhichadidae's response that a better term is low-intensity conflict). Since I do not have a better term (please suggest one if there is one), I named the concept of large swaths of the population engaging in violent engagements (including death) due to political views. It need not involve police, military, or formal institutions and could arguably be made up entirely of self formed militias.

That being defined, after seeing the responses to both left and right protests the past few years and the increasing violence between the sides, it's becoming apparent the violence is getting worse. Assault rifles, pipe bombs, pepper spray, and shields are examples of devices being used to attack the opposing group. The recent shootings are showing this increased violence. The current socio-economic and political atmosphere seems to arguably be encouraging this.

Now, my first thought was ""the police would step in."" In numerous videos I watched, it appears the police do nothing in numerous situations. Example would be the right/left stand off in Portland, OR where the police seemed to do nothing. Eventually the right-wing protestors left ending the stand off.

(This one is going to get ultra political) I further point to anecdotal experiences of my family who consistently call for armed insurgence, race wars, mass murder (eg, kill all blacks/gays).

EDIT: I just want to clarify that when I say ""undeclared civil war"" I do not mean like the first civil war in the US with large-scale government backed confrontation. I more or less refer to groups performing constant terrorist attacks, in the open or otherwise (such a bombings, violent counter-protests, etc). I realize now that associating this with civil war was a bad idea, but I have no better term.

Secondly, I'd like to point out I am in no way suggesting either side is more or less violent than the other but realize many of you have opinions on this.

We're all just out there doing our best and I wasn't being very respectful of that!   
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

For three years now, I've been living in a city that has a high % of cigarette smokers. While a lot of them respectfully smoke in designated areas, there's still a large number that smoke while walking down sidewalks, beside door entrances and other places in which non-smokers can't avoid. It makes me wonder: are they aware of the fact that their smoke travels and unwillingly enters the lungs of strangers walking by? Do they understand how incredibly uncomfortable it is for a non-smoker with asthma to breathe in this toxic air, with no choice? Their decision to inhale poison somehow becomes my problem. Even driving in a car that smells like smoke seems to upset my insides...

I'm trying to come at it from a more compassionate angle but the truth is, we all share air and as someone who struggles with vocal cord issues and other lung related complications, the secondhand public smoke highly disturbs me and leads me to believe that you are not very considerate or aware of your surroundings. Smoke travels, and it's killing our lungs and our planet. I'd like to better understand where smokers are coming from, if they are in fact aware of all of this and how I can maybe help friends who want to quit etc.

"CMV: A lack of empathy predisposes people to being racist/sexist, so we should try to encourage empathy in childhood school curriculum",7411,449,2020-07-28 22:08:11,"I was reading one of the abortion threads on CMV and I ended up feeling really upset about how many people seem mostly concerned about themselves, and far less so about the people whom they interact with. 

To me, this is a lack or failure of empathy. By being unwilling to consider or examine what it must be like to experience things in someone else's shoes, people draw conclusions like ""black people don't experience racism"", ""poor people are lazy"", or ""modern life is easier for women than it is for men"".

While many people don't consciously view themselves racist/sexist, I believe that the lack of empathy promotes a prejudiced culture/society and racist/sexist behavior. In a sense, I believe that many of the present-day social justice issues are fundamentally caused by failures of empathy.

To be fair, failures of empathy can occur in all directions (i.e. progressives failing to empathize with conservatives; such as a bunch of liberal kids harassing/teasing a religious person for more conservative views grounded in their religion; or socially crucifying someone for expressing socially taboo views).

So the CMV is essentially this: since I believe the empathy is so important, we should place greater emphasis on empathy in early childhood education. We can't trust parents to ""teach"" empathy, so we can expose children to teachers and books that promote empathy as a critical objective of curriculum. We should identify environmental risks that decrease empathy (i.e. child abuse, ACEs), attempt to get parents on board with empathetic child development, and we should discourage cultural elements like masculine expectations that boys should be unemotional and tough.

While there are some people who are biologically unable to have empathy (i.e. sociopaths), there is literature that suggests that empathy can be taught/cultivated.",1
CMV: When I buy a physical copy of a book I should have the option to purchase the audiobook at a heavy discount.,7411,311,2020-10-06 23:22:00,"I prefer to read books opposed to listen to them. I get a lot of satisfaction seeing the book on the shelf and being able to easily go back and reread an excerpt, if need be. A bookshelf and it’s contents can also be a great conversation piece. Therefore, I don’t buy audiobooks. However, there are certain times that I would really enjoy having the option of an audiobook, but paying full price for the physical copy AND the audiobook is silly. I believe most people are in this same boat and can’t justify buying a book twice. 

I have to assume that the the near entirety of the publisher’s investment into getting a book into audiobook format comes from the recording and editing of the audiobook. Once the audiobook is ready to go, there aren’t many additional costs. 

I bought your book to read. I’ll happily pay you a few more dollars *at the time of purchase* to be able to listen to it as well. 

I don’t like thinking that I know more that publishing companies that are *literally* the experts. Please, tell me why I’m silly to think this would be a win-win for everyone.

**EDIT:** It appears as if there are varying structures related to audiobook profit sharing. Under the royalty structure—where some combination of publisher/author/narrator are all paid a % of each sale—I believe it not to be advantageous to offer the audiobook at a heavy discount. However, there are certain publisher’s that don’t utilize this structure, and I still believe it would be in their best interest to offer a discount.

**EDIT 2:** *“How are you going to stop people from getting the audio/physical book for the cheaper price and onselling it?”* 

u/qu83rt makes this point which puts a gaping hole in my view. Any possible rebuttals to it would be appreciated.

**EDIT 3:** See u/Aksius14’s [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/j66yre/cmv_when_i_buy_a_physical_copy_of_a_book_i_should/g7x2sl2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3) as a possible solution to u/qu83rt’s point above.

**EDIT 4:** I’m getting a lot of comments suggesting that this idea is somehow a ploy to “rip off” audiobook narrators, authors, etc. or that I don’t value the work that narrators do. That’s not the intention. As I said in the original post, I’m contemplating if this would be a pricing structure that is a “win-win” for both the consumer and those involved in the publishing of the physical book and the audiobook.

**EDIT 5:** I could have been clearer in the original post. I’m not suggesting that it be *required* to give the audiobook at a discount. Again, it’s rather questioning if the pricing structure could benefit both consumer and publisher.",1
CMV: Sex ed should be mandatory.,7345,655,2020-08-02 22:50:26,"*good comprehensive sex ed should be mandatory

Some schools in the middle of America don’t do sex ed, or if they do, they make it super watered down. Ignorant, hyper-religious parents protest sex ed because they don’t like the idea of the children growing up or using birth control.

The fact of the matter is your kid is eventually going to find porn, no matter how hard you try. Seeing porn without knowing anything about sex is an absolute train wreck for your relationships. Girls will see themselves as objects. Boys will start to view girls as objects. Both will get unhealthy kinks and fetishes. Relationships will depend on sex. Children will be losing their virginity wayyyy too early, and they won’t have condoms because their sex ed class isn’t providing them, and they’re too scared of their toxic religious parents to buy/get them.

By boycotting sex ed, you’re risking that your child will have an unhealthy sex life. I haven’t seen someone provide an argument that isn’t “Jesus Jesus Jesus Bible Bible Bible premarital premarital premarital”


Edit: Abstinence-only sex ed isn’t something I support. I’ve experienced sex ed that included a teacher who only showed us anatomy and how puberty works, they didn’t mention sex at all, they just hinted at it saying “don’t do anything bad”. If you’ve seen the episode of family guy in which a religious leader does the sex ed for Meg’s school, though it is exaggerated, I’ve HEARD that a few sex ed classes do run similar to that, and I know that many parents want sex ed to run like that.


Edit:
1. Not all parents teach their kids about the birds and the bees

2. Of course abstinence is 100% guaranteed to keep you from STI's, and it should be taught, but birth control should also be taught.


Edit: I know a lot of parents. I know a lot of kids at the age in which they should know about birth control and sti’s. I don’t like the government, and of course I would want the guideline for the lessons to be approved by the public, but I think the government would do better creating a sex ed program than some parents.

Of course no one is going to agree on one program. I think that nearly all parents who disagree with what it’s teaching will tell their children what they are learning is wrong, and at the age where they would be learning sex ed, they would’ve developed a relationship with their parents. If something that’s taught in sex ed isn’t right, and parents point it out to their children, children with good relationships with their parents will listen to them. Children with toxic parents likely will trust educators over their parents. I sure would’ve trusted my sex ed teacher over my parents",1
CMV: There is nothing wrong with assuming someone’s gender and people that get upset about it are just trying to be victims.,7337,598,2020-09-09 10:29:53,"I posted two statements in one and will explain both individually.
*there is nothing wrong with assuming someone’s gender* the vast majority of people (especially in Western culture) are not in the LGBTQ+ spectrum, and even within those that are, people that are gender non-conforming are a small minority. These people makeup such a small percentage of the population that they are rare. Given this assuming someone that presents as male/female  is assuming something that is going to be the case in 90%+ of instances, so assuming that someone falls into the largest category is not wrong, but is safe. For most of modern history (correct me if I am wrong on that) and majorly observable instances of society, we have only known two genders (though evidence suggest some societies recognize a third, i.e. Thailand ladyboys and in South America some cultures historically recognized transgender people). It is therefore most likely that we only understand two and expect two, and most likely that they are what they were assigned as birth. So it seems that if someone presents male or female it is fair to assume that they are male or female. Given that these are likely to be the vast majority of experiences (I am assuming here someone that is MTF being called male rather than someone that looks like a MTF but wants to be called male) it seems fair that someone would assume gender based on what is observable.

*people that get upset are being over sensitive * I know that it is not many that truly get upset about this. On reddit it looks like a huge swath of the population thanks to things like r/TumblrInAction but I know they are the minority. Thanks to this and other times it seems that these people are wanting to yell at anyone, and are playing victim when they aren’t understanding the other.

I will gladly explain more as needed and look forward to replies.",1
"CMV: Instead of teaching youth to ""not judge"" we should be teaching them *how* to judge with kindness, mercy, logic, and fairness.",7318,156,2018-02-03 01:34:15,"Let me start by explaining what I mean when I say judge in this context. 

I am a father of a 5 year old girl and as anyone who's spent a lot of time with babies and young children, I want to help guide her through life and give her the tools to interpret the world around her. 

When we see a child behaving very poorly in public there are times when I choose to speak with her about what's happening. At the onset of this moment, when we are going to voice our thoughts about the behavior of others, whether it's my daughter and I, you by yourself in your head, or anyone in really any circumstance, we are entering a judgmental space by it's literal definition. 

Any way to frame, or speak about some else's actions requires judgments to be made. Our society has made the word 'judgmental' have strong negative connotations, and I believe people are uncomfortable with using others as teaching opportunities for fear of being ""judgmental"" 

Here's an example of what I'm talking about. Daughter and I see a child screaming in the market, jumping up and down creating a massive scene, hitting their parent ect.... I'll ask my daughter ""why do you think they're being so terrible"" (I insert the view I'm teaching, that the behavior is terrible, so judgment is made) but begin a dialogue. Normally she'll say ""they're mad"" or something like that, and we'll talk about things that make us mad, what might have this other child mad,  I'll say something like ""I get mad, you get mad, everyone get's mad sometimes, it's ok to be mad but that's not how we act when we're mad right?"" `yup` 

""Well why do you think we don't want to act like that"" and discuss how it's disruptive and rude to other people in the store ect..

I believe we should be creating a template for judgment to exist, where it's where the person's identity isn't attacked, but their behavior and actions (content of their character) are understood and discussed. 

Where we incorporate lessons of what, and what not do from others as well as we do from ourselves, and judge things in a manner that's kind to the individual, (not attacking their identity) that's with mercy (understanding we all experience these things) with logic and fairness  (by being honest about how those behaviors impact others around).
--------
The person who could change my view would do so by showing me how this style of parenting causes more harm than good and I shouldn't have a conversation with my daughter making judgments about the misbehaving child. 


EDIT- after reading lots of really amazing responses I have learned a few things. Firstly that framing things this way (with some of the specific language) could be bad for my daughter because when she steps out of line, she inserts herself as the ""terrible"" child, or that she is doing ""terrible things"", which may be true by whatever definition we have for terrible, it can damage self esteem and doesn't promote healthy learning. 

2ndly there is a problem with syntax and semantics with the term judgment, and while none of those arguments swayed me, they are still very much relevant. 

Lastly, it's Friday afternoon, and I'm going home. Be well.

CMV: The push for political correctness is what indirectly caused the rise of people like Trump and his ilk around the world.,7284,1248,2020-07-02 00:26:32,"It's  a pattern that you can see throughout history all the time. The society  is always somewhat split on certain topics, but it's only when one side  tries to push a little too hard that the other one is provoked into a  strong counter-reaction. You can see that in every other discussion -  the more self-righteous you are, the less likely you're to convince the  other person to agree with you (or to at least not violently disagree  with you). That applies double for the internet.

The  political establishments of pre-Trump era thought that they could  simply enshrine their progressive views in law and all would be well.  ""You can't say this or that anymore, it could insult someone,"" you would  often hear. ""How can you say *that*  in 21st century?"" would be a common line, too. You'd have people  lecturing others on how the world should change, what everyone should  and shouldn't do. And meanwhile some people got the impression that rug  was being pulled from under their feet. The world as they knew it  started disappearing.

Now, before  someone brings it up, I'm pretty much what the Americans would call a  ""liberal"". But I don't believe in revolutions and sudden changes -  that's political romanticism. The more sudden a change, the smaller a  chance that it's going to stick. The true change is a slow progress and  is made through meaningful dialogue. You may feel righteous when you  insult conservative Christians as backwards and deluded, because there  is science to support your views. You can get outraged over another  person's view on sexuality and call them whatnot, if you disagree with  them. You can call pro-gun people nutjobs and beat them over the head  with statistics. But keep in mind that if you try to convince someone  too hard, they are more likely to go in the opposite direction.

So,  the next time you feel like you're completely in the right, wherever on  the political spectrum you are, let's remember that the other side  thinks so, too. It's okay to disagree. We are human beings and we are  not completely rational. If we want the other person to at least listen, we need to be kind first.

EDIT: My view has been partially changed. I've come to agree that political correctness was not the sole reason for Trump getting elected. But I am still unconvinced that mockery, lecturing, humiliation and insults are a way to go in political discussion and that I still insist that the only thing this accomplishes is driving the other side further away.

The post has kinda exploded, so it's not within my power to answer everyone's replies, so I apologize about that. There have been some great points in the discussion, so thank you very much for taking part!",1
"CMV: Just like sex education, religion should be introduced to children only after they have reached a certain age and level of maturity.",7264,641,2017-04-09 00:17:51,"Let me be clear. I know this cannot be imposed in any form by a government or a law. I am proposing this simply as a guideline for current and future parents. 

My arguments are as follows:

* Children in their early formative years are incapable of rational, informed thought. Their entire universe is structured around what their parents tell them. If you tell them that the Earth is the shape of an upside down ice-cream cone and the sun is at the tip of it, they will believe you. Not just believe you, this will become their truth. 


* As an adult, your religious beliefs directly influence the life you lead . It will influence the decisions you make in terms of your life partner you choose, the company you keep, the vote you cast and the path you take in life. It should not affect these things in an ideal world, but we do not live in such an ideal world. 


* Considering the vast impact that your religious beliefs have, it seems very unfair to have one particular strict, unflinching dogma drilled into you during your formative years as a kid. Religion should be a choice just like your hobbies, your friends and your career.

* You may argue that many of us were raised this way, and we eventually ""grew out of it"" or changed our views once we reached maturity and broadened our horizons, but that is not a valid argument in my book. For every story of a person who has changed or given up religion, there is another story of someone who's upbringing was extremely strict or orthodox and it continues to define them as an adult, with our without their knowing consent. 

* This particular point may be directed to a very small sub-section of the parent population but I'm going to make it anyways. Some parents use religion as a crutch to assist them in raising their children. By this I mean that, God is the perfect, scary, all-powerful, metaphorical carrot & stick for your kids. Teach your kids not to steal, because it is the wrong thing to do. Not because God is watching. Teach your kids to help the poor because it is the right thing to do, not because it will help them get into Heaven. I don't want to tell parents how to raise their kids but I am drawing from my own personal upbringing.

The gist of my argument is this: Religion is a beautiful thing **if** understood and practiced as it is meant to be. If not, it can turn ugly and cause misery to oneself and others. Therefore, it should be introduced to children carefully and only once they are mature enough to grasp its meaning and purpose.",1
CMV: Police officers should face harsher punishment for committing crimes than the general public.,7148,354,2019-09-03 01:28:23,"We see it all the time, cops abusing their power, committing all sorts of crimes (DUI, assault, sex crimes, extortion, etc. ...) and the judicial system consistently lets them off the hook. I don't want to pretend that we don't see people fighting against this behaviour, because we obviously do. But at the same time, it is still wildly obvious that this stuff happens far too often and continually puts the safety of the public at risk. 

A huge problem that comes directly from this issue is that officers who do attempt to stop this type of behaviour, whether it be willing to arrest other officers or just refusing to participate, face massive backlash in the workplace from the rest of the force. They're actively incentivized to not stop this behaviour. 

I believe that if cops knew that the punishments they would receive for committing these crimes were harsher than those given out to the public, they would be less willing to commit these crimes and fellow officers would be more willing to fight back against it, as they may see that ignoring it is the same as participating and their livelihood is on the line too.

At the same time, I understand there may be other ways to achieve this, I just have no idea what it could be. So until then, this is my belief. Change my view.",1
"CMV: The freedom of speech must remain nearly absolute - not because hate speech is okay, but because the government would abuse a restriction on freedom of speech",7110,745,2020-08-12 17:32:39,"When we talk about restricting the freedom of speech, what we're typically talking about is the elimination of hate speech from the definition of what counts as free speech. This comes from an admirable place - hate speech is absolutely a social evil - but removing hate speech in general from the definition of free speech on a legal level is a horrific idea, because the government would improperly dictate (and thus abuse) what hate speech was. I'll provide three examples to demonstrate what I mean.  
  
1) The N-word. Undoubtedly, the N-word is hate speech *in certain contexts.* However, the caveat is that it *simply isn't* in other situations. When a character on Boondocks says it, or an actor in American History X says it, etc, the context is appropriate. However, this level of nuance is unlikely to be handled properly by the government, and either Black people would lose the freedom to say it along with racists, or else racists would retain their ability to use it as hate speech, making the law more or less ineffective. (If you don't like the example, refer to the other ones - I'm not here to debate when it's okay for which people to say the word.)  
  
2) The police and other not-at-risk groups. In several countries, the acronym ""ACAB"" (All Cops Are Bastards) is considered hate speech. Being a policeman is, however, a vocation, and not an at-risk group in any sense. For the same reason that ""cracker"" and ""honkey"" aren't really hate speech, ""ACAB"" is also not hate speech - white people aren't at risk of racial discrimination, and the police suffer no discrimination whatsoever. This is all to say, even if you dislike the examples, that the government will get to nitpick what counts as hate speech, and will inevitably include some stupid shit. (I'm not here to debate if it's okay to say ACAB, honkey or cracker, either. Pick a different example of fake hate speech if you prefer.)
  
3) The alien and sedition acts. When the government is given an inch, it takes a mile. The alien and sedition acts, both times, are the perfect example of what the government would almost certainly do if ""hate speech"", broadly defined, were made illegal. Like ""ACAB,"" other anti-government, anti-police, and anti-politician speech would become so-called hate speech, and thus be made illegal through semantic games. (And if you think ""we've learned since then,"" just remember that the same logic lead to the 2007 American banking crisis, since it was used to repeal Glass-Steagal. Things don't change as much as people think they do.)  
  
All in all, the people in power dictate what speech would could as hate speech, and this fact would not create a situation with less hate speech, but with either no change or primarily in absurd restrictions on non-hate speech.",1
CMV: Reddit has become extremely infected by US politics and Propaganda,7083,756,2020-04-19 15:25:47,"Most subs have turned into a “Trump bad, Bernie good” circlejerk, even when completely unrelated to US politics.

CMV: It should be legal for homeless people to sleep in their cars or in public places as long as they aren't bothering anyone.,7056,360,2018-11-24 16:50:41,"It's illegal in most places in my state at least for people to sleep in their cars or in public parks etc. A homeless person I know very well told me many stories about basically being shuffled around by cops for parking his car in a neighborhood and sleeping in it. No interaction with any of the people there or anything, just sleeping in the car. Some homeless people are disruptive or doing illegal shit which of course should get them moved, but really what's the plan if they have no money, just tell them to buy a house? I think 'being unsightly' isn't enough of a reason to kick someone out of a public place, and a minimum of human dignity should at least allow them to sleep in someplace safer than the woods. Being poor shouldn't be illegal, and sure maybe getting thrown in jail gives 'vagrants' a place to sleep but that should be their decision and not the state's.

Edit: A couple of people have mentioned congregations or mini-cities arising which I think is a fair point especially due to health concerns, at least for restricting sleeping in certain heavily populated areas. Not sure who to give a delta to, new to the sub, do I just give them to everybody who made the point?

Edit 2: Also, I'm getting a vibe that incorrect sedantry is the perceived problem, not people who live nomadic lifestyles. I'd like to clarify that I'm including nomadic people, really just anyone who gets fined for sleeping, especially those who park their car at 10pm in some quiet neighborhood and intend to leave at 6am. I'm also wondering more about the moral aspects of the problem.  

Edit 3: Do somewhat agree with the comments about sleeping in a park implies they won't have a place to throw trash, shit, etc., and causes an implied health hazard. I'm not entirely convinced the implied hazard is a justification for sleeping to be illegal, but I'm willing to listen. I'd also like to point out I'm talking about **sleeping**, not setting up businesses/tents and blocking the sidewalk during the day. Also I'm on board with the congregationalism problem, as those are specific circumstances the local government needs to specifically address.  

Also, for the people telling me to invite a ton of homeless people to sleep on my driveway, rude. There have probably been homeless people who have parked legally on your street and slept overnight that you didn't even notice. If homeless people turned your street parking into a car apartment that would be a problem but there are already laws in most places to prevent permanent parking. I don't want homeless people to live in your house, or for your neighborhood park to become a tent city.    

I live in a somewhat poor neighborhood and the people living in homes around cause much more trouble than the occasional homeless I see sleep on the street. I get that you don't like homeless people existing. A large portion of the chronic homeless population do have drug/hygiene problems, I don't want 'those' people near me either, but that's a different problem. I just think it shouldn't be illegal to park your car somewhere and sleep overnight, or sleep under a bench if you're too poor to afford a car. Please keep responses limited to the legality of sleeping in public spaces without inebriation or public disturbance.",1

They consistently deny it happening, blame Korea, blame Chinese looters, blame Chinese ladies of the night.

Rapes of thousands of females every night, including children.

Babies being skewered onto the ends of their bayonets.

Over 200,000 murders

Competitions to see who could behead the most Chinese and those competitors being treated like hero’s in Japanese published news papers

I’ll leave a link here because a lot of the things the Japanese did were sickening and not everyone wants to read about it all. ([https://allthatsinteresting.com/rape-of-nanking-massacre](https://allthatsinteresting.com/rape-of-nanking-massacre))

We label the Nazi regime and cohorts as the big bad for WW2 in our world politics/video games/movies and fiction but japan has largely escaped negative representation and even worse, persecution for what they did and the current government is built upon that denial and lack of ramifications.

Japanese nationals, the lack of punishment for the high ranking perpetrators and revisionist history have made it clear that a slap in the wrist was fine and they even go as far to claim that it never happen akin to saying the holocaust never happened, even at the Japanese ww2 memorial there stands a plaque which claims Nanking never happened.

To this day they have never publicly apologised for it and are currently reaping the benefits as the current political aspect of Japan is still the same descendants from WW2, with even one of their ex prime ministers being a class a war criminal.

Germany have changed and has completely separated itself from the early 20th century Germany while also acknowledging that they had a fucked history via apologising and righting any wrongs that could possibly right, Japan hasn’t and are still the same Japanese government since before WW2.

For some reason we tend to victimise Japan due to the nukes or we mislabel Japanese aggression in WW2 in a more favoured light instead of land grabs and disgusting acts of war.

So yeah first time poster here but I have a strong belief that Japan needs to be held accountable and stand side by side in history with the German army of WW2.",1
CMV: Nothing short of war will stop China doing whatever they want in Hong Kong,6964,505,2020-05-30 22:54:01,"Basically, I don’t believe sanctions would work in the near or medium term. They might work long term (over 20/30 years) but by then Hong Kong will have been fully assimilated. 

My reasoning is based mainly on how China perceive Hong Kong. To China, it is 100% theirs. It’s on the Chinese mainland and it was returned to them after lease from Britain. 

Because of that, there is no way to back down without losing an immense amount of face. You cannot be a superpower and allow the world to dictate how a territory of your country is governed. 

Therefore, there would have to be a war that is either victorious or has a negotiated outcome that ensures certain freedoms in HK. That war could easily become a major war (and even a world war) as again HK is on the Chinese mainland and a war over HK would be an existential threat to Chinese sovereignty. 

But that is what it would take.",1
Cmv: all religions are just old/big cults,6948,804,2020-05-12 15:10:36,"I thought about it recently, both sides are literally brainwashed by their leaders and sacred text.
I was born in a religious house and ever since I remember myself there was always a push to be religious and not ask questions (some are welcome but the questions I asked was always left unanswered, ignored or just completely telling me that I can't ask it) 
When I understood that I stopped asking questions and figured out I don't have to be my parents dream cause I'm my own person.
Lately I've seen some videos about cults and I can't see a big difference between religion and cult, both are following blindly whatever the higher being they believe in, and will die/kill for it.

Not trying to be offensive or anything but it does really feel like it.



EDIT: thanks for all the answers, I got my conclusion.


My conclusion is that first of all my question wasn't phrased right, I shouldn't have said all religions, I was only talking about Judaism, Islam and Christianity.
Second of all, I got to the conclusion that only certain parts of religions are like cults and share plenty of similar traits (in extremists parts of religions)

"CMV: People who wish to carry guns in public should have to attend a mandatory training session to learn/practice how to handle real-life situations (active shooter, being held up, etc).",6822,839,2020-03-26 11:13:26,"In the US, people are just going to have guns. No matter what kind of bills get passed, it's just a culture that is very attached to guns. People who would use them for ill purposes will usually be able to find a way to get them. And people who wish to protect themselves from those people will arm themselves no matter what they're told.

But a gun in the hands of an ill-informed, poorly educated, jittery, person who has never in their life been in a high-pressure, life-threatening situation where they had to act fast and decisively can make a bad situation more chaotic and dangerous. So I'm putting forth the idea that anyone who wants to get a concealed carry license (or even anyone who wants to own a gun) should have to attend a training course to learn how to do just that (as well as gun safety). And if they don't pass it, they aren't able to get that gun/concealed carry license. Just like a driving test.

&#x200B;

**Edit: Woah thanks for all the very informative comments! I think we've pretty much covered the basic major reasons why this would not be effective and even make the problem worse in reality, even if it seems like a good idea on paper.**

Additionally I'd like to add that it turns out most states DO require a bit of training to get a CW permit but I happen to live in a state which does not.

**1)** It would de facto violate/hinder the 2nd amendment right. Beyond the argument some people have that ANY hurdles to owning a gun is actually a violation of this, requiring people to pay  for the class, get to the class, buy the material to practice/take the class, would all create barriers to obtaining an CW permit that would effectively be socioeconomically driven. IE, you could only get one if you had the means to take the test.

Also, if the legislation wasn't done right, some states could make taking and passing the test so prohibitive that it would essentially enact a gun ban. At least to all except a certain class of people, which would be even worse than no on having guns in my opinion.

**2)** Having training doesn't mean that a person with a gun would improve ANY situation. In fact, having only SOME training might make a person without real-world experience think they were capable of handling a situation which in reality they were not. And if they hadn't had that little-bit-of-training-confidence-boost, they probably would have just had the sense to stay out of it, even if they were carrying a gun.

A very good example of this is all the police out there who have drawn their weapon out of sheer fear and killed an innocent person. Honestly, when someone made that point it alone was enough to make me realize that this training wouldn't change ANY statistics.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There were a lot of other good points and I learned a lot, but I think those are basically the two major reasons that pretty much made this argument a moot point. At this point it seems like there's a lot of restating of these same points.

But I thank you again for all your opinions and information you gave. I really do not believe that the US should or can be a gun-free place. I actually started thinking more about responsible gun ownership after my boyfriend got into them and made me start training some with them. I realized through this discussion that I am actually carrying around some bias towards the stereotypical Bible Belt gun fanatic, but that in actuality the majority of gun owners are responsible people who know their limits.

So if you thought I was just trying to get on a preachy liberal soapbox then I hate to disappoint you. Know that your smart-allecky comments did not add much to the conversation.

Thanks and keep having a great discussion!

Background: When I was 18 in college, I registered to vote through my friend, he was one of those ppl that ask you to register to vote. He asked if I could register to vote as a republican, so my friend would get commission. I said sure, I figured I could change parties later if I needed to. It struck me as odd that a political party incentivized this.

Over the years I’ve come to dislike both political parties. I agree with views of some of the parties, but hate a lot of cool kids/nonsense drama/gate keeping that comes with “being part of any party.” This extra cool kids/nonsense and gatekeeping distracts from the real issues and in my opinion blurs the real motive of why parties do what they do. 
I think we should do away with ALL political parties and vote for people only.

"CMV: Copyright in the US and around the world should be 20 years, and not 75+ years",6773,1064,2020-04-13 22:40:26,"The intended purpose of copyright is to give an incentive to create content. But if you can't turn a profit in the first 2 decades then tough, your content wasn't very good. But the larger purpose of having a lengthy copyright is not to incentivize content, but amass a huge library that in aggregate can still be profited from long after the original artists have likely moved on to other projects.

The obvious downside is that there would be that financing of content would be disrupted; there wouldn't be the willingness to sink costs upfront if there wasn't a chance for a lifetime of income from the copyright. But I believe that this discourages content since content creating companies become overly dependent on their catalog of content rather than create new material. I understand that making Friends and Seinfeld, along with the Beatles and Notorious B.I.G.'s  entire discography public domain would be the upside, but what major downside would there be if the copyright would be limited to 20 years. I'm not attached to the set years of copyright, so that's going to be pedantic if you try to argue with me about it being 20 years but 30 years instead. I want see why if any reason that we should continue to have Steam Boat Willie not in the public domain, and congress extending the copyright length every couple of decades since we are going to be due for another extension soon.

CMV: The American flag plays the same role as the image of Chairman Mao in China or Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam - it is a symbol of the state which is designed to develop strong nationalism to retain control,6763,589,2020-06-13 17:12:02,"I come from England where you rarely see the Union Jack or the English flag anywhere outside of government buildings, during the World Cup, or a few unusual people who have flagpoles. Actually having a flag on display is someone's home has negative connotations - associated with ethno-nationalism and by extension some far-right views. Not saying I agree with this, but it seems to be the prevailing view.

In China the visage of Chariman Mao is everywhere and the same for Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam. They have huge images of them in all government buildings and there is an image of them above the board in every classroom. They are described as the ""Father of the Nation"" and Ho Chi Minh is referred to as ""Uncle Ho"". My own belief for this is as a form of control - they both represent their own political parties and cultivate the feeling of trust towards the party in order to retain control. This is done in schools in order to develop that belief from a young age. I believe the US flag plays the same role within America.

I have extensively travelled America and I have always found it rather jarring seeing the number of houses which have flag poles and flying Old Glory. I also find it unusual that American school children have an American flag in their classroom or school which they pledge allegiance to. To me, it feels like attempting to brainwash children from a young age to be hyper-nationalistic and associate the American flag with themselves personally. This is the government cultivating nationalism to retain control. An attack on the US flag is an attack on American citizens. This is apparent in situations such as when Colin Kaepernick took a knee against institutional racism in the US and cannot get a job because so many people are incensed that he disrespected the flag and therefore them personally.",1
"CMV: All elected officials should have to swear on the Constitution, not a religious book.",6770,342,2020-08-11 13:13:42,"When it comes to publicly elected officials, they all seem to swear on the Bible, Quran, etc. The way I see it, is that these people are making a promise to themselves to uphold core beliefs within their faith such as hard work, perseverance, honesty, and a servants heart among other things. While it will not entirely solve the problem, I think that swearing on the Constitution is a way that we can hold these people more accountable. Every single day politicians and other elected officials lie, steal, and cheat the people of this nation. Of course there are a few good eggs, however I firmly believe a majority of these individuals are bought and paid for.  A lot go in with a clear mind, however when an organization like the NRA (no political bias here at all) comes in and says “hey if you vote yes for this and no on this, we will make a big donation to your reelection campaign” it corrupts the system. The same thing could go for a liberal organization. Their votes can change dramatically when someone is putting money in their back pocket behind closed doors. I think it is totally phony that these people swear on their selected book knowing that they are not going to uphold those standards. I really respected Kyrsten Sinema of AZ when she swore on the Constitution because that’s what these people are elected for, to uphold the law of the land. It shouldn’t be such a taboo thought to do this. Religion and politics are meant to be separate so why would swearing on these holy books be the first thing these people do? You can hold religious standards for yourself without swearing on a book. Practicing those values is something you should do everyday if you follow a specific religion, you shouldn’t have to swear on them to remind yourself to do so. Representation of everyone under the Constitution is important and when officials are upholding Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, etc beliefs to the extent of everyone, that’s wrong because we all believe differently besides the big things that most people agree on like not murdering, stealing, and so on. Swearing on the Constitution ensures that everyone is included not just those who follow or agree with a specific belief system.  I also understand that people are still going to have differences, however if religion was kept out of politics those differences would be strictly political and not involving religious views. I know religion does shape how people think, but I try to look at it like law. You have to keep your personal feelings/beliefs out of the way and uphold the law because the law doesn’t care how you feel, it’s about doing the right thing so that justice can be served.",1
CMV: Cancel Culture is counterproductive to meaningful change,6741,1179,2020-09-19 18:30:53,"Cancel Culture is counterproductive to having open discussions, whereby people feel safe enough to learn, change opinions and grow. The immediate action taken towards people for clumsiness, misinformation and mistakes should not be so penalising, and it actively prevents people from changing, it is a sub-genre of fear culture which is inherently silencing.

It also results in people having outwardly performative 'correct' opinions, when their reality may be very different- because they don't feel comfortable enough to genuinely debate tsuch topics without fear of being hung, drawn and quartered.

CMV: Judging Christians on the actions of pedophile priests is no different than judging Muslims on the actions of Islamic Terrorists - both are wrong,6725,490,2020-09-02 18:55:45,"Just in case anyone gets the twisted idea that I’m supporting these wicked people, I’m not, at all. Every single pedophile, regardless of race or creed, should face the full arm of the law. Simple.

Recently, a few articles got pretty popular on r/news about pedophile priests being arrested. That’s great, it spreads the important message that even those who we are taught to trust aren’t all truthful and can be truly evil. What’s not so great, in my opinion, is the slew of comments denouncing not the pedophile priests, but the faith itself. Calling all contemporary Christians evil, hatred people. Now of course there are evil Christians. Of course there is. Do they represent everyone? No, the faith is so diverse that no two Christians are alike.

I truly don’t see a difference between this and calling all Muslims terrorist. Both pedophile priests and Islamic terrorists maintain a sick sense of twisted morality where they wrongly use their religion to justify their actions.

When someone calls all Muslims terrorists, or uses the actions of a terrorist to label the Islamic faith, they are condemned- rightfully so. Yet, when people judge Christianity on the actions of pedophile priests, there is no sort of backlash, only an echo chamber of people filled with hatred

Now don’t get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with joking about these topics in the right atmosphere. However, the comments that I’ve recently seen go beyond a joke and are purely spiteful and disgusting against the wrong people

"CMV: Netflix is becoming less of a way to ""cut the cable"", and more like just another premium cable service like HBO.",6640,265,2017-08-27 22:12:48,"Here are my views:

1) By focusing on original content, Netflix is becoming less of an alternative to a cable subscription, and more of just another (albeit amazing and unparalleled) HBO type service.

2) Due to this and the glut of other subscription streaming services, the dream of drastically lower costs for the average consumer by ""cutting the cable"" while retaining most of the benefits of a traditional television are slipping away to the realities of a fragmented subscription market.

___

When Netflix came out and started gaining steam, the was a lot of talk about how it would possibly replace traditional, expensive cable bills.  But as the market has developed, it seems to me that Netflix has changed.  If I look at how I've used Netflix over the past couple years, it is almost entirely driven by their original programming.  And indeed, this is what Netflix wants, and I do love their original shows.  But it isn't replacing cable for me.  I don't really watch their movie/TV show selection much anymore because I've already seen most of what I'm interested in.  Narcos and Stranger Things and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt are great, but they are just fleshing out the lineup of shows I like in conjunction with all the other shows that I can only get with my $100 a month cable subscription.  I also like to watch the Walking Dead and Game of Thrones and the news.  If I want to watch the new Star Trek, now I have to shell out even more money for another subscription service.  If I want to watch sports I need either an expensive subscription ($40+ just for sports) or my normal cable subscription.  Now Disney is starting their own subscription service as well.  If I want Hulu's offerings, that is another subscription.  My point is that yes, if Netflix had been allowed to grow without competition it would be great to have one company dominate streaming and have all the content in one place for one cost.  But obviously other companies want to get in on it too.

I expect the main counterargument to this is that you don't NEED every scrap of content out there, so you can cut the cable and just get by with less entertainment.  Fair enough.  But that isn't really fulfilling *my* dream of cable cutting.  I didn't envision that these services would morph into a low budget option for people who can live with less content than they used to get.  In fact, I suspect that in this age of streaming options, most people will spend roughly the same amount for TV entertainment as before.  Because most people I know are still going to keep their cable subscription, and supplement it with a couple streaming options of their choice.  Realistically, I don't think we are in for an age of drastically lower prices.  It is a great option for a low budget or a college kid who can now get a LOT of value for $10 a month, but I bet the average person doesn't save any money in this new age of streaming.

EDIT:  So after reading all of your really well thought out comments, I still think I retain my view.  However, I do have a greater understanding of what cable cutting is for most people.  I appreciate more that Netflix's trajectory is just fine for a lot of people.  And that if you don't care about certain specific aspects of live TV (news, sports, etc), then it really is possible to pay less and get rid of your cable bill.  But I still believe that we aren't really in a new paradigm of cable cutting like some predicted. Until subscription services are the default instead of cable, most people I know (for what it's worth...) are going to keep both.  And due to realities of the business that many of you pointed out, it isn't Netflix's goal to fill every niche.  So hopefully we can all agree that the view I expressed isn't really wrong, but it misses the point.

"CMV: The majority of government economic disaster relief funds should go directly to the consumer, not to corporations.",6605,363,2020-03-23 22:05:31,"Whenever there is a major *economic* disaster (as opposed to the natural kinds), financial fear can spread quickly and cause consumers to scale back spending. Cash flow dries up and the economy grinds to a halt. Governments can jumpstart the economy by appropriating funds and injecting liquidity, which acts like financial grease.

Most of relief funding should go directly to individuals and families, not corporations (exceptions follow below). Here's why:  It is far more efficient to rescue an economy by helping the consumer than it is by giving the same amount to corporations. The consumer will spend the money where they need it most, which will incentivize companies to supply those needs and do so efficiently.

Example: Imagine that there are two farms:  One farm raises chickens and produces eggs, and another that only makes artisanal cheese from the rare milk of wild Siberian grass-fed goats. If you give 10 families each $20, they will likely reward the chicken farm with most of that $200, buying their chickens and eggs. But if instead you give each farm $100, the chicken farm producing the product in highest demand at this time will not get the funds they could use to expand their operations, hire additional workers, and better serve the community.

Exceptions: There may be a need to target specific industries, but it should be evaluated for health and safety reasons, not for mere convenience. Hospitals are one example where one can make a reasonable argument that their financial viability serves the public good.

Give the relief funds to the consumer and allow them to direct it to the products and services that are the most  valuable for them. The money gets spent and will still go to businesses  and corporations, but this way maintains market efficiencies while still  achieving in the desired outcomes.",1

Having to pay double to cross platform is unethical and as I result I should not feel bad for pirating said game.

CMV: Trump will retain the vast majority of his supporters (>80%) no matter what he says or does.,6473,1386,2020-04-17 09:04:03,"Given how his base has remained largely intact despite the jaw-dropping things he says and does, I don't think Donald Trump will lose more than 20% of his current supporters for any reason. A few things to make my view clearer:

* I define ""supporter"" as anyone who would self-identify that way and/or is currently planning to vote for Trump. So someone who doesn't like him as a politician or leader but is planning on voting Republican at the federal level would count. Such a person might fall under the 20% who would possibly change their mind
* I realise 80% is an arbitrary number, but I thought it best to put a figure beside ""vast majority"". I think that 20% can account for swing voters and those who aren't really committed to being his ""base""

In order to change my view, you have to convince me that there is something Trump could feasibly say or do that would cause him to lost more than that amount of support. Note that this doesn't have to be something that will happen or even is likely to happen, just that it is *feasible.* According to Five Thirty Eight, [Trump's current approval rating is 44.1%](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/).

If he were running in my country he would likely be a conservative but that's sort of besides the point. There have been a lot of assumptions made about me and a lot of people have sought to reflexively defend Trump without really addressing the point of this post in an effort to change my view. If anything, this reinforces my point.
2. Related to the first point, some people have said that the devotion shown to Trump is equally mirrored on the Democrat side. As an outsider looking in on America, I do not believe this is true, nor do I believe it is true in my country, nor even of the Republicans to this degree a few years ago.  I would not be making this post if, say, Mitt Romney was president right now. I do not believe there was this level of fervent and undying devotion to Clinton, Bush Jr. and Obama. They had their diehards, don't get me wrong - every president does - but the cult of personality around Trump is in my opinion unprecedented. This is of course exacerbated and modelled by Trump himself, who will not tolerate any disagreement or even open questioning of his words or actions in the media or in his own administration. Again, at a level I have never seen (outside of dictatorships). There is a false equivalency about how Dems and Republicans fall in line behind their leaders that this post goes over nicely: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/agsklj/ive\_made\_a\_huge\_mistake/ee93mwy?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/agsklj/ive_made_a_huge_mistake/ee93mwy?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). It is objectively untrue that Democrats rally around their leaders and change their opinions on topics to suit that purpose the same way Republicans do.
3. A lot of people have made the argument that a very large amount of his supporters only support him because they believe they had no alternative as people deeply opposed to Democratic policies. While that might describe a few people, I just don't buy that it makes up a big enough voting bloc to meet the threshold of this post. They had the choice of many other GOP candidates who would have basically towed the line on Republican issues. But they chose Trump. Please understand that one of the main reasons that I have this belief is because I don't believe Trump is a conservative at all. This post sums up nicely why it's so bizarre why conservatives support him: [https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/d50158/trump\_calls\_reports\_that\_hed\_meet\_with\_iran\_fake/f0ivux4?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/d50158/trump_calls_reports_that_hed_meet_with_iran_fake/f0ivux4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). He's not an anything. He is a vacuum, a populist and demagogue.
4. Some people have convinced me somewhat. The number one thing I think would get it done is if he actually took people's guns without due process. I don't think just saying he would do it would get it done, because he's already said it and while it hurt his support, it didn't cause a big enough drop. I think he would have to actually take the guns. Abortion also came up, but I think he would have to support pro-choice very vocally for that to happen.",1
CMV: Our current presidential debate formats are pointless and need to be overhauled,6451,327,2020-10-09 00:42:48,"Straight and to the point, as I’m sure anyone who has watched both debates would know why this is being posted. 

1) Microphones should be cut off after the candidates time runs out. If you have 2 minutes, you have 2 minutes. Once your time runs out, the microphone cuts off and it moves to the next person/moderator 

2) While another candidate is speaking, the opponents microphone should be muted, so there will be no interruptions

3) Refusal to answer a question leads to a warning, and if the candidate continues, the microphone is cut off and the remaining time is taken away. 

4) Non answers are called out by the moderators. No more allowing a candidate to speak for 2 minutes about something unrelated and not giving an answer. Moderators should pause a candidates time and microphone, ask that they answer the question at hand, and then allow them to continue. 

5) Misinformation should be fact checked in real time. If a candidate says something false, the moderator should be able to go back and inform the viewers that said statement is incorrect, and provide them with the facts.

6) There should be a round that allows candidates to challenge each other. They can both ask each candidate a few questions, which are pre screened by the committee so there are no personal attacks on family and such. This would be the round where they can call out the others policies, voting habits, bad faith statements, etc. 

I think this would dramatically enhance our debates and make it so the American people actually gain value from these debates. Obviously these are weird times, but that doesn’t mean we need to just have hour and a half long pointless arguments. The first Presidential debate was one of the worst things I have ever seen. 

We need moderators who are not afraid to cut off candidates, and call them out. No more “thank you for this question, but let me talk about something else for two minutes”. These are serious issues people want to know about. We don’t want to hear you give us the same 4 answers for an hour and a half. 

Candidates should be forced to give answers relate to the questions. Otherwise what is the point of these debates?

EDIT: This blew up way more than I thought it would. I did my best to answer as many responses as I could. I appreciate the good conversations. At the end of the day all that really matters is everyone doing your research beyond these debates, get to know the topics that matter to you, and make sure to vote!",1
"CMV: Americans have been brainwashed into thinking working hard, long hours is admirable",6429,638,2018-05-16 09:31:11,"My opinion relates largely to the corporate sector, as opposed to blue collar jobs. In my experience in white collar America, I have come across many, MANY average corporate drones (HR Specialists, Bookkeepers, Administrators, Marketing Professionals, etc) who will brag about:

1) Being the first person into the office each morning
2) Being the last one to leave the office at night
3) Working through breaks and lunch hours
4) Using little to none of their vacation each year
5) Missing family dinners, kids practice, etc
6) My personal favorite: Whenever a natural disaster happens, such as flooding, hurricanes, tornados, etc, they will brag about how they braved the conditions and made it to the office. Yup, they defied police recommendations to stay at home, risked their vehicle being damaged and risked potential injury or death to make it to their cubicle for 8hrs.

I read an article on LI today about the top reasons why people are late for work (Overslept, traffic, etc) and one gentleman, a Sales Development Rep from Philadephia, posted the following in the comment section:

""There are no excuses for being late. Worked over two years at my last job and never a second late. Been in my current role for close to six months and never late. To me, on time to work is 30 minutes early. Check the weather the night before, plot a course, and leave an hour earlier if necessary. During the snowstorm in 2015-16 I left for work at 3 in the morning and slept in my car in the parking lot to make sure I didn't miss any time.""

Does anyone else think that this mindset of completely unnecessary sacrifice and willing corporate enslavement is just stupid? Here's the thing. I do have what I consider to be a good work ethic. I put in anywhere from 50-60 hours per week and I've been successful in my career and I'm paid well because of it. 

That being said, work has NEVER willingly come at the expense of important events such as kids birthdays, after school classes, family dinners, etc. I would never in a million years feel obligated to risk driving through flooded highways and submerged roads just to get to the office to file my TPS reports. I'd never come in the weekends just to ""look good"".

Whenever a guy like me challenges this type of behavior of these types of coworkers, I'll typically be met with hostile responses or a dismayed feeling that I'm not a team player, not ambitious, etc. When I point out the generous amounts of vacation time, maternity and paternity leave, company holidays, mandated lunch hours, shorter work days, etc, that our European counterparts enjoy - while still being greatly productive and profitable - they make ignorant comments about those countries being lazy.

Like I said, I make a great living and I'm happy where I am. But when I'm leaving the office at 5pm on a Friday night to get home to my wife and kids and start my weekend off right, and I see guys waving me off like ""I'll be here till 10 or 11, I got a lot of stuff to catch up"", I don't admire their work ethic, I question their time management and their priorities.

Go home to your family, people. If you hit a car and die on your way to work on Monday morning, the HR department will be typing up your job description to post online on Tuesday. Nobody from the office will stand up during your funeral service and talk about how great your spreadsheets were and if you hit quota last quarter. You're disposable, replaceable, and there's more to life than making the Board of Directors even more rich while you give them even more of the prime years of your life essentially for free.

""Arbeit macht frei"", my fellow Americans? Or am I just a bone idle schlub from Office Space? Change my view.

"CMV: No one on Reddit actually believes the upvote button is red and anyone who says they do are either colourblind or baiting for an ""argument""",6411,252,2019-03-08 06:06:04,"Now before you downvote me to oblivion let me make my point - 

I know talking about the colour of the upvote button is the virtual equivalent of beating a dead horse, but I just thought I'd say it because it popped into my mind a few hours ago, but:

It's been settled. We've been over this before and the colour of the arrow has been proven - it's orangered. People have checked it, multiple times. 
Here's the thing though - even if it hadn't been proved yet, there is absolutely no way that anyone who can see colours properly would legitimately think the upvote button is red. It's unfathomable to me how you can look at it and say it is even though it's more clearly an orange-ish colour. So either Reddit is severely exaggerating the number of people who actually believe this or there is a big number of people who want to perpetuate the argument for the joke of it, even though it has already lost any comedic value it ever had.

CMV: Sex work is as much of real work as being a professional entertainer or athlete.,6394,1467,2020-03-13 13:02:24,"I am currently on the brink of accepting that sex work is real work because of one simple argument: If actors, singers, and athletes have real jobs because they entertain people, then sex workers have real jobs because their job is also to entertain people. While some people may argue that anyone can provide sex, but that it takes training to act, sing, or play sports, a rebuttal to such an argument would be that a lot of sex workers also train to be as arousing as possible.

Change my view that sex work is real work.

"CMV: The ""a character should be voiced by a voice actor of the same race"" issue going around doesn't make sense and is hypocritical.",6367,757,2020-07-02 16:56:40,"VIEW HAS BEEN CHANGED!


 BIG EDIT: Thank you for all the upvotes! Also, I have been rightfully corrected by many commenters and I want to set the record straight. 
This isn't really about accurate casting, but about giving non-white voice actors more opportunity to test their skills and represent. Minorities in general have been severely underrepresented in media, not just in cartoons. As an Asian who loves film, I would love to see more Asian actors and actresses on the screen. 

If the character's race is a vital part of his/her story, then the race of the VA should take high priority 

Original post:

With actors such as Jenny Slate and Allison Brie stepping down from their roles on cartoon shows Big Mouth and Bojack Horseman respectively, I feel like I have to speak out against this current trend. The argument that a voice actor can only play a character of his/her same race is fundamentally flawed in the current and historical state of voice acted media. What I've noticed is that the only voice actors getting called out for this are white. But if this was truly a ""all race"" issue, then why haven't these other voice actors been called out? Samurai Jack is played by Phil LaMarr, a black voice actor. Most of the main cast of Avatar the Last Airbender are played by white voice actors. If this discussion was truly about, ""all races must be played by their respective race"", then why haven't these shows been called out? In my opinion, this is a ""whitewashing"" issue, but it's not even really whitewashing. All I'm asking is for the people pushing this forward should be consistent in their judgement. But I feel like if there was an animated show with an all Asian cast played by Mexican voice actors, no one would bat an eye, because the voice actors arent white.

Edit: I see now that most of my argument complains about things that have already happened and can't change. Let's switch the conversation to look towards the future.

Edit 2: Its been brought to my attention that actors who are involved in this debate such as Slate and Brie voluntarily spoke out. That's my mistake, I was under the assumption that they had been called out by the Internet, which led them to act.

Edit 3: This topic is less about who plays who, but about more non-white voice actor representation. There are so many talented non-white voice actors that lose a chance at a role because a white actor gets chosen instead.

Edit 5: This issue is complex and should be judged on a case-by-case basis.",1
"CMV: Immigrants who have been naturalized and have received U.S. citizenship, should be able to become president.",6352,918,2020-07-15 08:42:39,"I will preface by saying that this is by no means a very critical issue in America, but I do think it might be important in America's future. 

 If an American born person, with no political experience or qualifications, can become president. Why can't an immigrant who has citizenship and a good political experience not become president? America is great, the main part because of its diversity. But, where is the logic behind not letting an American become president just because of their birth in a different nation? 

The whole point of democracy as I understand it is to give the people the voice on who will lead them. And it seems that Americans don't care too much for the place of birth. For example, Ted Cruz was runner up for the Republican nomination even though was born in Canada. Same for John McCain as he was born in Panama.

My point is that it would do no harm for this country to let non naturally born people become president and it would let a good amount of new, smart people have the chance to lead the United States.",1
CMV: If 18 year olds aren't trusted to buy alchohol they shouldn't be trusted to vote.,6336,906,2020-03-15 22:00:39,"I was born after the drinking age was raised to 21 and I always thought that was fairly reasonable as if 18 year olds could purchase liqour then kids in high school had access. Personally while the concept of access does not apply to voting I'm not sure if I am okay with allowing high school seniors the right to vote. Seeing as the brain is widely considered to be developing until the age of 25, in addition to the age to purchase alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis all being 21 in Massachusetts. So the question becomes when are citizens considered adults? Is it at 18 or 21? If its 18 why dont they have all their rights? If its 21 why are they allowed to vote before they're an adult. Mind you this whole thing made more sense in 1971 when they lowered the voting age to 18 because at 18 you had almost all of your rights. Now it seems like at 18 people become junior adults.",1
CMV: Child beauty pageants should banned as they promote a toxic environment and normalize pedophilia,6327,397,2019-09-18 22:08:41,"So as my post goes I think beauty pageants should be banned everywhere and I still don't know why they go on. I remember a while back watching that TLC show about child beauty pageants and seeing kids who literally had zero clue what was going on with pancake makeup on prancing around on a stage to appease 20+ men and women which I think is gross and terrible. Here's a list of reasons why I think pageants are terrible for anyone 17 and under.

1) Kids have zero concept of looks or beauty and are forced by parents who are projecting their desires on their kids to be good looking.

2) the amount of cut throat and terrible behaviour from parents to other parents or even parents to kids is extremely weird. (As someone who's had friends play hockey I could understand the competition part but at least in sports theirs some team building)

3) 30+ aged men and women judging children on how good they look and ask them to twirl around is just gross. I mean anywhere else if you would ask a kid to do what some of these judges say you would immediately be arrested.

4) Beauty pageant kids grow up with a toxic mindset that beauty is the only thing that should matter in life and if they don't get enough Instagram followers, Facebook likes or tweets they get upset and have this mindset their worth less.

In all I think child beauty pageants are destructive to a young child's mind a bear no actual positives even pageants 18+ still create a toxic environment but at least then men and women (not judging) know the difference of right and wrong, losing and winning, and aren't as competitive and cut-throat.",1
CMV: Job postings should be legally required to include the minimum pay rate offered.,6321,321,2020-02-24 18:58:23,"Job vacancy advertisements should have to include a minimum pay rate that the employer is willing to offer, so that job seekers immediately know what to expect for a wage range prior to applying.

The requirement should be in a common-sense format like ""Minimum $8.50/hr"", ""$45,000+ annually"", or ""Commissions Only, but minimum wage guaranteed.""  Probably would have to forbid benefits from being mixed in to make the direct gross pay rate look bigger.

America already has a similar law regarding advertisements for lending offers.

Saying BS things like ""your earning potential is limited only by your drive to succeed"" as a maximum is a separate issue from my proposition.

My first guess is that some kind of obfuscating phrase like ""$7.25/hr for completely inexperienced candidates, much more for any experience"" might become commonplace at first, because so many shyster HR departments would want to circumvent the spirit of the law.  But I would guess that eventually, the work force would come to associate that phrase with ""that's gonna be a low-paying job"", much like we now associate the lie ""We work hard and we play hard"" with the reality that they'll just work the dog shit out of you.  And then the better-paying employers will eventually realize it helps them to actually advertise their higher pay, and wage competition within industries will increase.

It seems to me that this would help put upwards pressure on wages (pleasing the left) through free-market competition (pleasing the right) just by mandating that the truth be disclosed up front (which SHOULD please everyone).  It would also (very) slightly reduce structural unemployment because job seekers would waste less time wading through, applying for, interviewing for, and sometimes even accepting jobs that they later discover pay relatively too little.

What am I not taking into consideration in my fantasy?

4) One thing that's tripping a lot of new folks up: it's currently common for companies to advertise for one job posting, then come across a candidate who is absolutely unqualified but they want to hire him for a different position.  This law wouldn't prohibit that; in fact, a Delta went to a commenter who pointed out that this law would have the additional benefit of encouraging companies to write more accurate job postings and think more deliberately about who they want to attract, which benefits everyone.",1
"CMV: This is a racial, cultural, socioeconomic, and police brutality issue. Not just a single one of them.",6257,344,2020-06-04 05:22:39,"Recently, I have been seeing many posts suggesting that it's only one of these issues. There can be multiple issues (and multiple solutions) to this problem. 


I want to start by explaining why I think it's a racial issue, followed by socioeconomic status, then culture, and lastly police brutality.


**RACIAL**

I think that this is an issue that goes back to the beginning of America. For centuries, Black people have been oppressed. Slavery was immensely damaging to the Black family. This is **not** comparable to how the Chinese were treated and how the [Irish were *indentured servants*](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/us/irish-slaves-myth.html) . Also, the Confederate Constitution *specifically* singles out African Negroes as slaves, not Irish people. Also, neither country was ravaged as heavily as African countries by European people.  In any case, after literal *lifetimes* of slavery, Black folks were hit very harshly with Jim Crow Laws which didn't end until the 1950s. [The origins of gangs with African Americans actually started because they had to defend themselves from racists while also trying to make a dollar.](https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/poverty_prejudice/gangcolor/madness.htm). 

""A final factor encouraging gang formation was the Chicago race riot of 1919, in which gangs of white youth terrorized the black community, and in response black youth formed groups for self-protection.[60]""

Another quote 

""Racial anti-black violence on the part of white youths directly contributed to black youths forming self-protection societies that transformed into black gangs by the late 1960s.[61]""

[The Wikipedia page](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangs_in_the_United_States)

Then there's *redlining*, which still hurts some minorities [today.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/03/28/redlining-was-banned-50-years-ago-its-still-hurting-minorities-today/). [The War on Drugs was specifically targeted to harm Black people.](https://qz.com/645990/nixon-advisor-we-created-the-war-on-drugs-to-criminalize-black-people-and-the-anti-war-left/).  So many racist laws and practices were put into effect and still affect so many black families *today.* Black folks were oppressed for so long and then pretty much expected to ""catch up"" and build on a foundation that (racist) society effectively shattered and did not take adequate measures to repair.

- Also, according to Yale's *Empirical Analysis of Racial Differences in Police*, while the police shoot and murder Black and White folks at roughly the same rate controlled for different factors, they also found that Black and Hispanic folks are 50% more likely to be subject to some force when being arrested. The study suggests that when controlled for contextual and behavioral factors, the number is reduced but still doesn't explain racial disparities. [This has the same Abstract section.](https://www.nber.org/papers/w22399) Furthermore, Yale concluded that while being compliant (and no arrest has been made), black people are 21.3% more likely to be subject to force. 

- [This article points out some disparities in drug use.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5614457/) ""...Blacks in our study were more likely to be incarcerated on charges explicitly labeled as drug-related, Blacks would also be more likely to suffer the collateral consequences specifically associated with drug charges, such as exclusion from certain forms of financial aid, housing benefits, and job screening scrutiny."" 

""The response to the current opioid epidemic, a public health crisis with a “white face,” has been contrasted to the crack epidemic that hit Black communities hard in the 90s and was met with war tactics in affected communities rather than compassion for offenders.""

[While Black and White people use and sell drugs at the same rate, Black people are punished more for it.](https://www.vox.com/2015/3/17/8227569/war-on-drugs-racism) [source 2](https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/4/20/17262276/marijuana-arrests-420-day-african-americans-arrests-disparity) Ironically, in the study linked above, it showed that in that particular city, Black people were more interested in marijuana as opposed to White people who were more interested in heroin. [Black drug offenders also get sentenced more harshly.](https://www.vox.com/2014/7/1/5850830/war-on-drugs-racist-minorities) 

- Black people are more likely to have their cars searched (and less likely to be explained a reason why). A Rhode Island study also showed they were likely to be stopped *and* somehow less likely to receive a citation. To me, this suggests that they were effectively stopped for no reason. A study in New York City showed that blacks were more likely than whites or nonblack minorities to be in jail while they await trial, even after controlling for the seriousness of charges and prior record. Black people are also 13% more likely to receive a plea deal that included longer jail time, again controlling for factors such as prior record. Researchers found that North Carolina prosecutors were excluding black people from juries in capital cases at twice the rate of other jurors, even when controlling for legitimate justifications for striking jurors, such as employment status or reservations about the death penalty. Black convicts have their probation revoked more often than whites and other minorities, according to a study of probation outcomes in Iowa, New York, Oregon, and Texas. These racial disparities held even when the study controlled for other characteristics of the probationers, such as their age, crime severity, and criminal history. [source](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2015/08/racial-disparities-in-the-criminal-justice-system-eight-charts-illustrating-how-its-stacked-against-blacks.html)

Stop and frisk is also widely considered to be a racist policy.

Redlining directly attributed to blacks being unable to move from poorer areas to nicer neighborhoods and gain wealth through owning property in nicer neighborhoods. It also prevented their children and future generations from accessing better schools.



Also implicit racial bias plays a big role in black kids underperforming

**SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS**

Various studies have shown Black people are directly harmed because of their socioeconomic status, even in Health care. Redlining and poor schools did not help with this. While a lot of people enjoying citing that Black people commit substantially more crimes than White people, they forget to acknowledge the context surrounding black people. Besides just the racial element, we see that crime is heavily linked to poverty, and the rate of poverty among Black people is [quite high.](http://federalsafetynet.com/us-poverty-statistics.html) While it is true that poor White people still commit less crimes, they also seem to live in less densely populated areas as well. For example, Centreville, Illinois, has a population of about 5000 (according to the Census), and [a population density of 1,170 and 95% of the people who live there are black.](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/centreville-il-population/) [The crime rates are 72% higher than the national average.](https://www.areavibes.com/centreville-il/crime/) Similar results were found for Selma, Alabama. It may also be attributed to a culture. 

[Another study](http://law.ku.edu/sites/law.drupal.ku.edu/files/docs/law_review/v57/7.0-Peterson_Final.pdf) finds that the ""gross rates of violence are two and a half to five times greater in the three types of non-white neighborhoods than in white areas (5), but these differences drop to a maximum of one and three quarters after critical community conditions are taken into account (Table 2).""  These ccommunity conditions seem to be differences in access to external resources (such as home loans) and socioeconomic disadvantages.


[Socioeconomic status has been proven to be one of the best predictorS for success. Study showing it’s just as important as Cognitive ability and personality traits.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00047.x)



**CULTURE**

Cultures are directly influenced by their environment. They don't just appear out of thin air. And they certainly aren't genetic. There are no inherent genetic differences, such as being more prone to violence, either. This notion has been denounced by anthropologists and biologists alike. And no, [humans are not like dog breeds](https://evolution-outreach.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12052-019-0109-y) and that is a historically racist analogy. The number of loci analyzed is the most critical variable: with 100 polymorphisms, accurate classification is possible, but ω remains sizable, even when using populations as distinct as sub-Saharan Africans and Europeans. Phenotypes controlled by a dozen or fewer loci can therefore be expected to show substantial overlap between human populations. This provides empirical justification for caution when using population labels in biomedical settings, with broad implications for personalized medicine, pharmacogenetics, and the meaning of race. [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1893020/) From the same report, ""...in a reanalysis of data from 377 microsatellite loci typed in 1056 individuals, Europeans proved to be more similar to Asians than to other Europeans 38% of the time."" Another quote, "" It is also compatible with our finding that, even when the most distinct populations are considered and hundreds of loci are used, individuals are frequently more similar to members of other populations than to members of their own population. Thus, caution should be used when using geographic or genetic ancestry to make inferences about individual phenotypes.""


And no, Black folks don't just disregard education because they aren't genetically capable.[Here is an article I find interesting:](http://www.theroot.com/articles/politics/2013/01/acting_white_theory_black_academic_achievement_based_on_other_factors.html) The various studies cited in the article found is that black students value education as much or even slightly more than their white counterparts. In any case, I believe that this culture is a direct result of racism. A society that was once *extremely* racist held black people down and it effectively molded the culture that others now deem ghetto. For example, the gangs I mentioned above. [And also, more unfair practices even into the 90s.](https://www.salon.com/2013/08/10/busting_the_crack_propaganda_myths_partner/). Lots of people don't realize that only until half a century or so ago, blacks were effectively *not allowed to buy houses* in many cities. Redlining is not an ancient practice. Realtors and city lawmakers got together in the early to mid 20th century and literally drew lines where black people and other non-whites were allowed to live. Outside the line, and nobody would sell you a house, banks wouldn't give you a mortgage, regardless of your ability to pay. Typically the minority districts didn't have much real estate for sale as it was mostly rental property. So you have multiple generations of people barred from building up any kind of equity or wealth. Parents unable to help save their children from financial ruin. People having to rely on welfare to survive. Welfare is tricky because it's a system designed to keep you reliant on it.
I'd argue the current ""hood"" culture is a direct result of racist policies like redlining as well as misguided, well-intentioned social engineering (creation of housing projects, welfare system) in the 1960s.

Since the end of slavery, black people have been--and continue to be either in law or in practice--subject to [housing discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_discrimination), [mortgage discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_discrimination), [job discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_discrimination#Ethnicity_3), [exclusion from political representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_suppression#United_States), [police brutality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality_in_the_United_States), the [school-to-prison pipeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School-to-prison_pipeline), the [prison-industrial complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison%E2%80%93industrial_complex), and so on and so forth. Prejudice and disenfranchisement in turn contribute to [worse health outcomes](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0138511), the [cycle of poverty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_of_poverty), and [limited social mobility](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-008-9354-z).

The idea of a ""black culture"" as the single cause of systemic poverty of black Americans is fairly incoherent. It assumes that there *is* some uniform black culture with stable features, and asserts that the characteristics of that culture account for some unique variance--over and above other factors--in the present socioeconomic conditions of black people. (This portion was an answer from a redditor a while back) **Note that I am only referring to the negative aspects of ""the culture"" that people like to refer to.** RnB, Rock and Roll, Soul, Disco, House, and Jazz originated with Black people/culture, for example. Also, one of the biggest disadvantages that is specific to black Americans is the removal of their culture and heritage. African immigrants are more likely to have a college degree than the average American

**EDIT**: As a user mentioned earlier, I failed to acknowledge Black fathers. Not purposely, though. I was just caught up with other issues. 

According to [this](https://www.fatherhood.gov/library-resource/myth-missing-black-father), ""statistics show that close to 70 percent of all births to black mothers are nonmarital, giving rise to the stereotype that black fathers are largely absent. However, while black fathers are less likely than white and Hispanic fathers to marry their child's mother, many black fathers continue to parent through cohabitation and visitation, providing caretaking, financial, and in-kind support."" 




**POLICE BRUTALITY (and by extension inappropriate actions)**

I have addressed a lot of this above so I have less to say about it. It is undeniable that police brutality can occur to anyone, and it has. I think a problem equally as large is how easy they get off, though. The same Yale study I mentioned above actually suggests that it is quite rare for police officers to be held accountable. Even Jimmy Atchison's, Philandro Castile's, Tamir Rice's, Breonna Taylor's (though her situation is recent), and Eric Garner's murderers have been fired *at worst.* [I mean, even this man.](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CAQhrFdJISa/?igshid=8b8ptplpoz05) Also, even at the protests there are several instances of unprovoked/unwarranted violence from the police.

**EDIT I am a Black teenager/college student. And I do support BLM. I have donated about $100, have signed petitions, emailed, and made phone calls.

CMV: Male sexuality is poorly understood and stereotypes and this has harmful consequences.,6234,621,2020-08-19 21:24:23,"Male sexuality is often: 
- Mocked : cumming fast , small dick, men are expected to be silent during sex
- Denigrated: perverts, sex addicts, rapists , players 
- Trivialized - you come and you’re good - what do you expect a back massage ? 

At risk of generalizing, the sexual psychological experience of many male sexuality is neither animalistic nor game-like nor silly. It’s a strong part of who men are and it can be complex or painful or transcendent just like the sexuality of women. 

For example, take the perverted/ addiction aspect of male sexuality. Men are very visually and physically guided as a couple studies have shown (e.g. Chung et al 2013, book by Paul Martin). Men can be very susceptible to porn addiction. This isn’t necessarily fun and isn’t always a choice - it can be a powerful unconscious impulse. Men may feel stigmatized in getting help or talking about this. Our society either ignores the unconscious, objectifying aspects of male sexuality, or completely extremifies it - comparing all men to Weinstein or Charlie Sheen. 

Another example is sexual pleasure. Men with circumcisions may feel much less sexual pleasure than females and have far weaker orgasms - yet this completely unacknowledged by media outlets ( I would argue contemporary psychologists as well but that’s debatable). The thought of trying to help men have better orgasms feels crazy in our current societal climate - yet helping women ? Absolutely! 

Lastly men may value the intimacy and shared pleasure of sex just as much as women. All the media tropes of men sleeping around, hating cuddling, etc may keep our partners from adequately valuing and supporting those needs. 

To summarize, male sexuality can be objectifying and unconscious but it is either completely disregarded or treated to extremes (perverts , Charlie Sheen...). Male sexual pleasure is sometimes trivialized or outright considered taboo (see circumcisions)  and should be treated as important and talked about in the same light as sex positivity movements for women. 

You could change my mind by explaining why I’m being overly reductive about male sexuality , or show me strong examples of male sex positivity , or explain why our society should be prioritizing discussions of female sexuality over men’s. 

I realize that I have a slant (slants) here that people may take issue with. I may come off as blaming women. I’m making no arguments about who’s fault it is - in fact it’s probably men’s fault because we need to be the ones brave enough to talk about it. I may come off as completely unrepresentative of male homosexual or transexual experiences. Please enlighten me in both cases- I wish to learn more and help correct my gaps and ignorances.

THE DELTAS: I’m taking a break for a little while. Some takeaways from my discussions below. I should host these discussions from a place of “yes,and” instead of pitting male vs female sexuality against each other . Also, in many places, cultures, and contexts in our world the treatment of female sexuality is so backward and repressive that it makes perfect sense to prioritize female-centered movements. Lastly, for understanding my own male heterosexuality I should look into communities here on reddit like r/menslib and talk openly to people I trust! 
Thank you all! 

PS: I waded into a ongoing heated debate over circumcision which often shows up on reddit and perhaps wont be resolved until there is more scientific research or broader societal consideration.",1
CMV: All hidden costs (including tax) should be included in consumer prices,6211,731,2020-02-19 15:05:41,"US has weird habit of not including sales taxes in products they sell in stores. This is confusing and makes almost impossible to estimate your expenditure. I know that they do this mainly for two reasons. One is that taxes varies between regions and other is that they don't have to tell you how much the product actually costs and can advertise a lower price.

When I go buy anything I want to know how much it will cost me.

I don't have issue with taxes only but other hidden costs as well. I get upset when I have to pay mandatory handing fees, cloakroom tickets, package fees etc. Just last week I bought two concert tickets and had to pay a delivery fee for an e-ticket. I had to pay them for each ticket I printed myself. This is nonsensical.

Now I understand if the hidden cost is something that is dependent on the whole purchase like for example postage cost. This is ""fixed cost"" that gets lower more you buy and cannot be directly added to the products cost. But if you have to pay the cost independently from your other purchases that price should be added to the items cost.

Last argument I can think for this kind of system is corporate customers. They will pay taxes  separately and pay the lower price of the items. But that is why the title said that consumer prices should be clear.

And please don't make a bandwagon argument ""This is system we have. Deal with it."" That is not a productive comment. I know that changes has to made to laws but better consumer protection is always worth it.

To change my view show me a benefit for a consumer of showing a lower price that they actually mandatory has to pay.

[Edit] Many of you are pointing out that it is hard to make nation wide advertisement that includes the local tax. First of all most adds can be localized with ease. Those that cannot should include the highest possible price and something like ""this or lower"". And nothing like this doesn't mean that the actual store couldn't include the actual price in their stickers. That cost is non existent for the store.

[Edit] u/Tuxed0-mask pointed out interesting fact. T-shirt at German H&M and in France H&M will cost the same amount to end consumer. They have same sticker price, can use same advertisement material etc. All this despite the German having different tax code (VAT) than France. So this shouldn't be a issue.",1
CMV: The pledge of Allegiance is scary and stupid,6198,1373,2018-10-19 22:31:08,"I've lived in the US for 8 years now but the pledge has never really become normal for me. I know it by heart and stand to say it every day, but there's always a thought in the back of my head. I always think that the pledge is half brain washing and half just tradition.

I see no reason for having kids say those words unless you're trying to just get them to become a swarm of little Patriots who see nothing wrong with their country. This is a toxic and harmful way to think because they won't be able to fix problems cuz they won't see any.

Tradition is a big part of many American families, but what's the point of hanging on to such a little thing? Most people I know don't care for the pledge, they never even gave a second thought to it. So I don't see the point of keeping on saying it every day. Maybe if you do it on special occasions it would be more meaningful, but then it gets back to the problem I have with it mentioned earlier.

All in all I think it's scary as its brainwashing to a degree, and it's also stupid.",1
"CMV: It is acceptable to decide the current state of the world is not ok, but choose to ""stay out of"" it and try to just live a happy life.",6193,489,2020-05-30 03:35:52,"Clarification is crucial for my specific situation:

I'm a left-of-center intellectual person in my 30s. Like most people fortunate enough to have a stable home life growing up, I grew up thinking things were just fine, almost like learning about ""bad things"" that happened in history were now over and that modern times issues are resolved. Of course as I got older (as most do) I learned more and more that the current state of the world is more of a ""work in progress"". My ideology then became ""as a good person, I should do whatever I can to help things get better!""

After a number of years of this, I have seen things get worse in my opinion (not trying to get too political, but it's not just politics: pollution, runaway capitalism, loss of regulations, sustainability, climate change, neo-facism, etc.)

I am *now* of the opinion that as an individual, I most likely can't fix things in a large-scale, meaningful way, so I prefer to ""micro"". I keep myself informed of world events, news, etc, but I no longer feel outraged or upset by it, instead I prefer to make my own tiny slice of reality as good as I can. I have a job where luckily my hard work does result in micro improvements to the big picture (I'm a teacher), so I do that as well as I can, I garden, compost, recycle, stay informed, and I vote. But most importantly, I *accept* that I won't make the world into a Utopian paradise though my actions, and I basically just mind my own business.

I'm posting this because some people I've come across identify this approach as ""cowardly"", ""giving up"" or something along those lines. But I think it makes more sense to kind of ""keep my head down"" and go about my existence in as positive a way as I can. I *know* things are messed up, but I have no interest in helping to make things better in the big picture. I mostly try to just ""stay out of it"" and in fact I don't even want to argue about it with anybody anymore.

EDIT (30/5/2020 12:25UTC): First I want to thank those of you commenting who actively contributed and helped me to broaden my perspective. Since it's become nearly impossible for me to respond to every comment, I feel the comments are mostly covered by one of the following categories:

1. **People who essentially are saying I do more than most, or as much as I reasonably can, and that I have the freedom to choose how much that is, more power to me.**  \- These are in the clear majority and confirm that my position is morally defensible. Thank you.
2. **People who point out that injustice and evil in the world thrives when individuals espouse my (selfish) perspective** \- I have considered this carefully. However many of those comments are either asking me to do things I already do (stuff that I consider to be under my ""micro"" heading), or are not clearly offering me any alternative actions to take. I find some of those responses to be full of campy rhetoric, insubstantial and unconvincing. For example, lets use 1930s Germany as an instance to explore this perspective. Suppose I were a well-to-do citizen of some means and I saw Nazis taking over. My reaction would most likely have been to sell all my assets, take a pile of cash, and bail out with my family. This was *not* an uncommon practice, many people simply ran away from the Nazis. One could argue that had more ""stayed and fought"" things would have been different, but I dunno....a large angry mob with guns vs. some civilians standing up for what's right? Which side ends up with more casualties? Instead, the runners were able to live and have children and grandchildren. Scientists left and worked on the atom bomb for the U.S. Isn't it better to live through the situation than die meaninglessly? *One* death (the hypothetical me in this case) is inconsequential, but the life of someone ""keeping their head down"" (and in the extreme case, running away) can have far more utility.
3. **People who are working on the phrase ""It is acceptable to...""** \- It can be pointed out that this is mostly just semantics, but I asked this question not because I had doubts about my perspective, more like I wanted to take the temperature of a larger community to see where I stand. It sounds like most of you would agree that it *is* acceptable, and thus my view is unchanged.",1
CMV: Class and wealth distribution are more important then issues of race and would be more effective to focus on in order to get positive change. Corporate america will always focus us on race rather then class.,6158,481,2020-06-15 01:11:19,"Obviously racism exists and it is a problem, I am not arguing about that.  I just think it is the lesser of two evils.  I think we are sort of missing the point with these protests.  I think Democrats will back them 100% because they know they get easy votes from it.  Obviously as you read on, I voted for Bernie and I don't know for sure what would have happened if he got elected, it is hard to trust any politician, especially national ones because all you see is them on TV.  But I am curious if I am missing something here.  I like to say 'Corporate Democrats' basically the democratic party will use identity politics and social issues as sort of their crutch to get elected.  But when push comes to shove they will not do much for working class, lower income people.  They will be mostly bought and paid for by large corporations and special interests and won't rock the boat too much.  Now I think they are the lesser of two evils when it comes to Democrat vs Republican, sure and they do at least pass some policies, probably just the bare minimum to keep their base happy and to get enough votes.

I will admit I don't have a ton of specialist knowledge in politics but I do listen and consume what I would like to think is a vast array of content that contains perspectives from right to left, up and down.  And have for years.  I do my best to avoid echo chambers and to really try and listen to all opinions regardless of source.  I understand some people think of Obama as a hero, and someone with true class.  I will admit he speaks well and by all public facing evidence is a gentleman.  But is he much better than a corporate shill?  What besides Obamacare(which he %100 had to do or else why would anyone vote for a democrat again?) has he done for the poor and disenfranchised?

Are we really being bamboozled by corporations into buying into lesser narratives like a race war in order to avoid talking about the larger and more impactful issues of class discrimination and massive wealth distribution inequality.  I think corporations and corporate democrats will always talk about race because it is a social issue and so long as they make their solidarity posts and maybe hire a minority leader they will quell the mob and the mob won't talk about how they refuse to allow unions or provide decent healthcare or a decent wage, regardless of race.  Race keeps the lower class divided and it keeps corporations out of the public eye.   I think liberal media(CNN CBS, etc) aka corporate media will continually push the race war narrative because it is in their best interest.

CMV: Research surrounding vaccines should never be in a situation where it can be 'stolen' and should be readily accessible to scientists around the world.,6129,367,2020-07-22 23:13:34,"While the title is self-explanatory, I woke up this morning to the news that the [United States was accusing China of attempting to steal their COVID vaccine data](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/us-china-covid-19-vaccine-research/2020/07/21/8b6ca0c0-cb58-11ea-91f1-28aca4d833a0_story.html).

Now, I recognize that there are situations where states may not want their information taken by other state actors (see, [defense information from the US and China](https://www.cfr.org/blog/chinese-hackers-are-stealing-us-defense-secrets-here-how-stop-them)). However, *especially* amidst a global pandemic where  over 15 million people have been diagnosed and over 600,000 people have died from the virus ([Google: COVID Statistics](https://www.google.com/search?q=total+world+covid+deaths&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS845US845&oq=total+world+cov&aqs=chrome.1.0l3j69i57j0l4.3062j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)), it is unethical, in my mind, to withhold research information that could bring the world to a successful vaccine.

I believe there is a sort of historical precedence both for and against this, but the best comparison I am able to make is how Jonas Salk, the creator of the polio vaccine, refused to patent his discovery due to the morality of such a choice with a quote akin to ""would you patent the sun?"" [Here is a source that sums it up](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20200326/10100644177/67-years-ago-today-jonas-salk-announced-polio-vaccine-did-not-patent-it.shtml), though if you can find a better one please let me know. While this isn't vaccine research, the point stands that if there is access to life-altering technology, it should be shared not sold or kept a secret.

I get we live in a capitalist society, but morally I cannot fathom this lack of sharing knowledge. Even if initial costs are high, wouldn't costs overall *decrease* as more people have access to it?

Edit2: I would like to clarify that my concerns, while stemming from news that came out today, are more holistic in not sharing medical research that can have significant impacts on global communities. Cancer research, malaria vaccines, HIV ARVs are all great examples.

Edit3: A generous amount of deltas and explanations will be coming out shortly, there is a lot of good information in here and I strongly recommend you take a read through it!

Edit4: A lot of people are getting hung up on the morality of healthcare *costs* - which I am sure in some facet we can agree on that. This conversation is focused on the sharing of knowledge to create vaccines and treatments, **not** their subsequent costs.

CMV: The 13 Reasons Why is nothing but glorification of suicide and martyrdom and should never have been made.,6072,387,2019-08-30 05:16:04,"I get it, it’s just a TV show for entertainment purposes only. But the running concept of the show is “Girl gets bullied. Girl doesn’t get help. Girl kills herself and makes 13 different tapes that explain why each of these 13 people are responsible for her death. Each of the 13 people then has to take responsibility for the fact that they are the reason she’s dead.” It’s not a direct summation of the show and I’m sure I missed some of the fine details here but that’s the general premise of the show. 

It’s insane to me how much positive feedback this show got. It’s basically a glorification of not taking care of yourself, not asking for help when you need help, not really trying to find an answer to your problems and then killing yourself. It doesn’t stop there though. It then takes it to the next level by essentially promoting the message that “if you kill yourself and blame somebody else, you’ll change the way they are.” It’s a horribly offensive attention grab of a show that shamelessly promotes martyrdom as an answer to your problems. 

And the show itself is contributing to the problem. [this study](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/news/science-news/2019/release-of-13-reasons-why-associated-with-increase-in-youth-suicide-rates.shtml) shows that in the month after the release of the show, rates of suicide and suicide attempts jumped by 12 percent in boys and 21 percent in girls. I understand the concept of body is responsible for your suicide but you. Ultimately if you kill yourself it’s on you. But come on, when a show that’s aimed at high school age children advertises martyrdom the way that “13 Reasons Why” does, and then a huge jump in suicide attempts comes around the corner somebody needs to see that the show is bad and should be pulled.",1
CMV: Free awards and the large amount of cheap reaction awards has devalued the meaning of Reddit awards,6051,205,2020-09-11 15:25:55,"With the new system of people able to claim free awards, and the large array of cheaper reaction awards, I now often see posts with dozens and hundreds of awards, which has desensitised me to the specialness of awards.

They used to be a rare or special thing to acknowledge something special or show gratitude, but now these awards are just thrown around every where and no longer have the same meaning to me as in the past.

It is impractical to not have a way to check your work when studying and as such is pointless without having a section dedicated to problems in each chapter. Many textbooks have a solution manual that accompanies the text so they should put the problems in that instead of the normal text book. Companies only do this gauge every penny they can and I doubt they would include everything in one book when they can sell two. Therefore, practice problems should be in the solution manual. ",1
"CMV: It should be Everyone vs Racists, not White vs Black",5995,622,2020-07-30 23:01:10,"For context: I'm fully Asian, however I'm mixed in the sense that I'm half South East Asian, and half East Asian. Countries of East Asia (China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan) are generally regarded as the 1st world countries/superpowers of Asia, with the rest being mostly 3rd world countries, with the exception of Singapore, which is in South East Asia. In Asia, racism definitely exists, but with a heavier emphasis on racial discrimination between social class. Like many other mixed people, I've grown up not being accepted by either country; not being accepted by my East Asian country for not being ""pure"", and South East Asian country by not fitting in culturally.


Now, to my main point. I've lived in the US in the past for around 5 years, and I'd say I watch a lot of world news, following social, economic, and scientific views and problems. The recent BLM movement in the US makes sense, and I do support it. However, what doesn't make sense to me is the ACAB movement and the BLM movement as of today. They say they should defund the police among other things such as how EVERY SINGLE cop is bad, rather than spending more on their education and making stricter passing conditions, like other 1st world countries(Most countries have academy training that spans years, with yearly retests). Additionally, I've seen news on how people of the movement are looting and destroying the businesses of their own community, which doesn't make sense to me at all. I've also seen many people on the BLM side complaining about ""whites"", and insulting them; isn't this exactly what they were protesting in the first place?

In conclusion, US politics for me seems like a mess that is highly hypocritical. Yes, in the US the most major form of racism is arguably racism against POC, but everything seems FAR left or FAR right, with no middle ground. Not every cop is bad, like how not every teacher or politician is bad. Yes, there is a much higher percentage of bad cops in the US, but using the word ""All"" makes little sense to me. Additionally, not all ""white"" people are racist, and POCs can definitely be racist too. But the solutions each group seem to be making are absolute ideals, with no consideration of a middle, grey-area argument. Politically, this would be called as centrism, which has it's own faults but I believe is still better than what is going on at the moment.

It's not white vs black. It's Everyone vs Racism. If it were to be white vs black, what would you say about the (White) people who died fighting against the Confederates? I also see people saying, ""But you're an exception, we don't include you in ___"". Isn't that the same as unconsciously admitting the flaws in your statement? There are people saying reverse-racism doesn't exist, whilst going full circle and being racist and judging people who don't believe their ideas. This however, does not mean I support All Lives Matter. I believe this because I know that ALM was born as a (very flawed) counter argument against BLM.

A similar situation I believe that exists within the US is the feminists vs men, when it should actually be everyone vs sexists.

Edit: Everyone vs Racism, since Everyone vs Racists doesn't make sense grammatically.
 
Edit 2: Centrism, not Centralism, and other typos.

Edit 3: After reading many of the comments, I have improved my opinion on ACAB, and a better understanding of BLM. However, I still inherently believe that these acronyms are a very dangerous way of addressing problems, as they can be easily misunderstood, and there should be a better solution.

Although the BLM is a movement as a whole, I still think that because it operates under different viewpoints/interpretations by different people, it has it's weaknesses. I still fully support it under it's core cause, but I think it has veered off course in multiple ways.

Edit 4: Makes sense, not complete sense. I've also seen people mention my Asian background, and saying that it's part of the problem. I'm not trying to use it for anything or to change anyone's opinion on how they should read my post. I'm just mentioning to say that I am NOT Asian-American; I am culturally attached to Asia, but I do have better understanding of the Western world compared to the rest of my people. This is purely an outsider's point of view, one that can have no direct influence as again, since I'm not American, I can't vote for American Politics. I can only state my opinion.",1
CMV: r/pizzadare is a subreddit showcasing and glorifying sexual assault of (mainly) working-class men. It should be banned.,5985,1632,2019-12-24 22:52:45,"Here is the sub I’m referencing: r/pizzadare.

(NSFW, obviously)

The tl;dr is that nude women get off on opening the door for delivery people or room service, sometimes forcing them to interact, touch them, or watch them perform sexual acts.

In my opinion this is significantly worse than, say, a dick pic (which many would agree to be quite offensive, if not actual assault) - a) because it is done in person, b) because they are in middle of **doing their jobs** which means the victims either cannot disengage or face repercussions if they choose to do so. Now, obviously there are some instances where the men appear to enjoy the encounter or even get sexually involved with the women (although a good number of those seem staged), but I do not believe that excuses the vast majority of these situations in which the victim feels awkward and doesn’t know what to do with themselves. Not to mention the invasion of privacy of being listed in a sexual video on the internet.

I know the super woke on twitter might object to this line of reasoning, but if the genders were reversed I 100% believe the cops would be called and the guy would be labeled a pervert and sex offender. His life would be ruined.

How a subreddit glorifying and specializing assault on innocent people trying to do their jobs in peace is just beyond me. It is clear that some of the women are being encouraged to perform these acts by others in the subreddit, and therefore I believe banning the sub will directly decrease the amount of men getting assaulted in this manner.

CMV: Social Media is a problem because it gives stupid people power,5987,246,2020-09-18 21:31:15,"Disclaimer: I do not wish to offend anybody. Nor am I saying that I am particularly smart.

My theory:

the average person is pretty stupid. And a very large number of people is even more stupid than that and let's further say that 8/10 of those very dumb people think that they're actually not dumb but in fact they think themselves rather clever. This in turns make them extremely vocal about their views and opinions .... because heck why not, they are smart right? They have all the answers and want to share them with the world.

Now, before social media those people were a contained problem. They were the weird guy in the pub or the kid on the playground who wouldn't shut up about conspiracy theories. You could simply ignore them or tell them you weren't interested.

But since social media it has become as easy as never before in human history to inflict your opinion on the world. You just twitter away ... you blow your 2 cents into the aether. And guess what ... you're very quickly and easily going find someone that thinks alike.

And that is the problem. Stupid people are becoming a force to be reckoned with. Not because they are right about something... but because they are collectively stupid. And that gives them power.

Instead of the one weirdo you could just ignore you have hundreds or in some cases even thousands of people who are organizing themselves and are spreading their message ... the best example I can think of here are flat earthers.

CMV: Divorce is not a Tragedy; a tragedy is staying in an unhappy marriage.,5945,451,2018-11-11 21:40:01,"Here are my reasons why staying in an unhappy marriage is worse than getting a divorce, especially with children involved. And I am not going to address marriages that contain abuse, drug use, or financial irresponsibility. I'm just referring to marriages that have become roommate situations at best, daily fights at worst.

1) You will not grow.

Marriage is an opportunity to encourage one another, to become a better person than you were yesterday. It should be a place of mutual respect and support. But if you are in a marriage with a disconnected, unsupportive, nagging, etc., spouse, any growth you make will be survival skills.

2) You will likely become depressed.

People often assume that someone is lonely if they are alone, but I'd argue that sometimes the feeling of being alone when you are with someone is much worse. That feeling of knowing things shouldn't be this way, that you've tried and tried and you are still stuck and have no means of making the marriage work and just pass each day as co-managers of shared life logistics is depressing as h-ll. The inability to fix a marriage will make this worse, and while there are thousands upon thousands of counselors and books and classes and talks about fixing your marriage, in truth they rarely work. 

3) You will have a negative impact on your kids

There's so much to tackle here, so I'll just cover the most salient points. Kids will learn what marriage looks like from you. If you are modeling a bad/unhappy/unhealthy marriage for your kids, the best they can do in their own future marriage (if they even want to be married after witnessing yours) is to use your marriage as an example of what not to do. Some say that they don't fight in front of the kids, so it's not hurting them. Well, kids pick up on the negative emotions in the room. You don't have to raise your voice or slam a door to know mommy and daddy can't stand one another. And if you grow up in a family where the parental foundation is really a shaky facade, the kids will be raised feeling insecure about their family and their relationships. 

4) One of you is likely to cheat on the other

It's happened so much around me in the past few years it's sad, and that is one or even both spouses cheating. Whether it gets discovered or not, it's happening a lot. Now, I'm not saying that having a happy, supportive marriage will mean one of you will never cheat. Nor am I saying that you can blame an unhappy marriage for your affair. If you cheat, you made that decision with free will. In short, I think it's much more likely that being in an unhappy marriage creates an environment where one or both of you may cheat. 

5) Very few people have what it takes to fix a marriage

If you and your spouse have spent years being unable to communicate and resolve your issues, if you have reached the point where you nitpick each other in front of your friends, etc., I think the marriage is dead and can't be saved. This last item is probably THE biggest one that someone may be able to change my view on. What seems to happen, though, is that one or maybe even both parties in the marriage is unwilling and/or incapable of doing what is necessary to fix a bad marriage. One person can't fix a bad marriage; it takes two. And from what I've seen, most people are unable to do what it takes to fix their marriage.",1
CMV: Reddit awards was a bad idea,5940,256,2020-08-01 06:35:19,"Money being a way to distinguish posts/comments goes against the idea of the constitution.  A website of the people, by the people, and for the people.  Not anymore.  Now one guy with money can make a post stand out way more than a hundred upvotes would.  It takes power away from your average, well-to-do redditor.  

Also, I’m pretty sure there are hidden meanings in awards that lets trolls use them sarcastically and in bad faith.  

I don’t care if it makes Reddit more money, unless they were going bankrupt without them.

But I still have a lot of Reddit to explore, so maybe there are good uses for awards I haven’t seen?  Change my view.

Edit: Well now I see that nice message you get when you’re post is gilded.  That is pretty nice.  I guess I was successfully bribed.

CMV: A huge number of problems in the United States would be solved if politicians were limited to a single term.,5933,286,2020-07-27 07:24:48,"I hate politicians. Primarily at the federal level, but at the local level I'm still not a big fan. Our world needs order and someone needs to make the rules. I hate, however, that being a politician has become a class all of its own.

So much of the fervor and hate that exists in the country is fed and fueled by people pointing fingers at others and calling them evil. ""Republicans are racist, vote for me!"" ""Democrats are communists, vote for me!"" It all comes to the same point, getting as many people behind you so you stay in power instead of the other guy.

Some congressmen have held their office for longer than I've been alive. I'm a mom of two with a bachelor's degree. In that time, they've enriched themselves and their families/friends in the millions of dollars.

I've talked to people about this before, and they've always said that two or three term limits would be ok. I think one would be even better.

Once someone is elected, they spend so much money trying to convince people to vote for them, either by campaigning, or posturing in the political arena, saying they're doing so much, when in reality, nothing happens. No more re-election would erase all of that immediately. 

Yeah, government is complicated, it takes a little while to figure it out, giving an extra term or two helps them figure it out. I don't agree. There's been many a time where important laws get passed quickly. If you feel the pressure to get things done before you're replaced, you'll figure out a way to get things done faster. 

Having single term limits would stop the ""career politician"" from being a thing. You get one term at the local level, any position, and one term at the federal level, any position. After that, go back to being a dentist, or a truck driver, or a school teacher. Manipulation and lying wouldn't be something people get paid for anymore. Plus, people in office would be more in touch with the normal American.

Think of your least favorite politician.(Trump doesn't count, he is a lot of things, but he is not a politician) How much better would it have been if they'd been released back into normal life years ago? Or if they had a definite end to their awfulness in a few months? It'd be a bummer for the very few good ones there are, but with more turnover, more actual good people would have the chance to make a change. Good honest people who would be willing to take a break from their lives for a couple of years to make good changes in their communities.

I would really love to be taught some different aspects of this. I'm not an expert of government or politics, so I really want to be taught the flaws in my thought process.

I'm not saying it would be the ultimate best answer, but it would fix a lot.

Edit: Thanks so much for the people who responded with info instead of just saying ""people like you are why the world sucks."" I've given out a few ∆s. My view is changed.

A big problem in politics is the corruption. If the ""career field"" wasn't so insanely lucrative, it would resolve the problems more than putting a single term limits. The prospect of being reelected would be a bit more incentive to actually do good, but keeping lobbying out of the picture would help a lot.",1
"CMV: There wouldn’t be such a stigma against fatty foods, if “fat” (the caloric source) did not share the same word as the adjective of a person being “fat”.",5843,398,2020-05-21 20:27:35,"So fats, are just another source of calories, just like protein and carbohydrates (sugars). Yet fats get a really bad rap because they are associated with being fat. Yet, a person can consume almost no fat in their diet, yet still become fat if they consume too many calories from other sources. Think cows. Their diet consisted almost exclusively of grass, yet they can get quite fat.

Yes, your body processes different types of calories differently (protein, carbs, and fats are all processed by your body a little bit differently), but at the end of the day, a person becomes fat of they are taking in more calories than they are burning.

A few months back, I started the low-carb keto diet, and have actually lost weight while having a diet that consists of far more fatty foods than I used to. Because again, fats are just another form of calories, and as long as you are burning more calories than you take in, you will lose weight.

In my experience, lots of carbohydrates are far more indicative of gaining weight, yet there isn’t widespread stigma against carbs.

So my view is that fatty foods have such a stigma because of the association of the noun “fat” with the adjective “fat”. People are often far more concerned about a piece of food being high in fat than they are about apiece or food being high in carbs, even if the piece of food high in carbs has far more overall calories.

If for example, we started calling fats something else, like “lipids”, there wouldn’t be such a stigma against eating foods containing lipids.

Likewise, if the condition of being overweight was called something like being “carby” and having lots of “stored carbs” around your gut, there would be a much greater stigma around eating carbs, instead of fats.

CMV: Privacy is a fundamental human right and we should stop using the products of corporations that violate it.,5822,370,2018-11-22 23:51:32,"We should start questioning wether the business models of these huge data-gathering corporations are ethical and benefit society.

a) Just because you have nothing to hide doesn't mean that other people don't either.

b) Having something to hide isn't in accordance with doing something wrong. Many people, especially minorities, that live in oppressive countries need to hide their identities from these corporations and subsequently from their government to be able to live.

c) You're empowering these billion dollar companies to control and manipulate you in any way they like based on their knowledge of you.

Firstly let me say that I posted here to actually have my mind changed because I wasn't fully convinced about the issue and wanted to hear from what others had to say.

Secondly, a lot of you raised some good points and flaws with my argument which I appreciate and while I haven't fully given up my opinion, you did reshape my thinking.

I guess in the end my argument would be, whether it's a violation of privacy or not, to stop actually consenting to companies and ultimately governments owning and controlling our data in the first place because of the multiple dangers this brings to our civil liberties, which privacy is an important one of them in my opinion.",1
CMV: People should stop assuming that someone in a political party believes EVERYTHING that party believes in.,5784,1134,2018-10-18 02:43:18,"I’m a Republican.  But I believe that anyone can be married to anyone.  As long as it doesn’t hinder my rights you can marry whoever you want.  You can spend the rest of your life with the any person you desire.  The Republican party believes in traditional marriage and voted against gay marriage in 2015.   I can’t believe it was not legal in the first place.  Things like that make me question the party continuously.  

My major beliefs belong to the Republican party.  Therefore, I call myself Republican.  Due to the political “stereotypes” running around, I sometimes call myself a centrist.

I get slandered all the time by Republicans calling me “traitor” or flat out ignoring me.  I get assigned to the long belief list on the Republican website.  I actually hate many things Republicans in power do.   I don’t like Trump.  I’ve seen enough.  

This doesn’t just apply to Republicans though.  It applies to all parties.  I only know about the Republican side because of my experience. 

We should stop assuming that people saying that they belong to a party automatically believes in EVERYTHING it stands for.

CMV: Resisting arrest should not be allowed as the solo criminal charge,5784,636,2020-06-16 11:43:51,"In March of this year, police officers in Sacramento arrested a man they misidentified as having a warrant out for his arrest. The arrest turned physical with an officer kicking the suspect while he was being compliant. Even though he was later confirmed to not have a warrant, the police charged him with a single count of resisting arrest. 

Just earlier today, a disturbing video was made public that showed an officer from the Anderson Police using a recently banned ""chokehold restraint"" to arrest a man that was only eventually charged with resisting arrest. 

Using this as a sole charge is often the byproduct of a police mistake or even an unjustified arrest. I believe that the charge is meant to deflect from police misconduct and place the blame on the defendant. It does not serve the interest of justice to use ""resisting arrest"" as a sole charge, especially if the arrest was a case of mistaken identity.",1
CMV: The delay of Merrick Garland's SCOTUS nomination for 293 days - while a Kavanaugh vote is being pushed for this week - is reason enough to vote against his nomination,5770,1368,2018-10-03 22:55:58,"I know this post will seem extremely partisan, but I honestly need a credible defense of the GOP's actions. 

Of all the things the two parties have done, it's the hypocrisy on the part of Mitch McConnell and the senate Republicans that has made me lose respect for the party. I would say the same thing if the roles were reversed, and it was the Democrats delaying one nomination, while shoving their own through the process.

I want to understand how McConnell and others Republicans can justify delaying Merrick Garland's nomination for almost a year, while urging the need for an immediate vote on Brett Kavanaugh. After all, Garland was a consensus choice, a moderate candidate with an impeccable record. Republicans such as Orrin Hatch (who later refused Garland a hearing) personally vouched for his character and record. It seems the only reason behind denying the nominee a hearing was to oppose Obama, while holding out for the opportunity to nominate a far-right candidate after the 2016 election.

I simply do not understand how McConnell and his colleagues can justify their actions. How can Lindsey Graham launch into an angry defense of Kavanaugh, when his party delayed a qualified nominee and left a SCOTUS seat open for months?

I feel like there must be something I'm missing here. After all, these are senators - career politicians and statesmen - they must have some credible defense against charges of hypocrisy. Still, it seems to me, on the basis of what I've seen, that the GOP is arguing in bad faith.

CMV: You aren't a strong person if you can't understand or at least acknowledge the importance of vulnerability and being emotional,5735,287,2020-06-22 17:04:09,"I have always seen people down play the importance of letting someone know more personal things about yourself. I understand being vulnerable takes trust but there's a point when people just have to accept that they can get hurt too. I know people in my life who don't say anything about their emotions or feelings and that includes my own Dad.

It feels like people want to avoid getting hurt so bad that they can't accept that it's ok to reach out to others. That getting hurt from others is normal and that you shouldn't avoid being vulnerable entirely but learn to know which people to trust.

What irks me the most is people downplaying the importance of emotions as if those emotions aren't part of who they are. Some may see those types of people as strong to be able to repress their emotions but not me. To me you are stronger if you can face those emotions and be able to ask for help when needed.",1
"CMV: Just like anorexics are forcibly hospitalized and made to gain weight, overweight people should be hospitalized and forced to lose weight.",5636,421,2019-01-14 21:12:10,"Society seems to agree that you can take away an anorexic’s rights if they are too thin and medically unstable. 

I was hospitalized four times for being seriously underweight, and I didn’t have a say in the matter. I was forced to gain approximately half a pound a day, with the consequence of having certain things withheld, (showers, visits, phone calls), if I didn’t meet that goal, and ultimately the threat of a nano-gastric tube being shoved up my nose if I consistently failed to gain weight. 

Binge eating disorder is recognized as an eating disorder yet in each of my hospitalizations, there was maybe one or two severely overweight person on the unit, and they obviously escaped the consequences related to weight gain. 

I believe that those who are severely overweight due to binge eating disorder are just as at risk for health problems (both short and long term) as any anorexic and should face the same swift action that I did. There should be a medical component that forces them to lose weight at a determined rate with co-occurring therapy to address the underlying issues. 

If they refuse treatment, they should be forced into it with signatures from psychiatrists, same as an anorexic would be, for reasons that they are a danger to themselves. 

Now clearly this isn’t happening...so I’d like to believe that there’s a good reason for it. So, change my view?

EDIT: I know the title says “overweight” but I’m specifically talking about overweight folks with a diagnosed underlying mental illness of binge eating disorder, some level of physical health problems, and an inability or unwillingness to treat their issues on an outpatient basis. I’m not advocating for rounding up every overweight person on the planet and sticking them into treatment centers. 

EDIT 2: This has been fascinating and so enlightening. Thank you to everyone who broke things down for me and helped me see the difference between the health risks associated with malnutrition vs. obesity. I knew I was biased in this situation but I don’t think I realized how much so. To anyone suffering from an eating disorder, at any size, weight, or variation of behaviors, I wish you healing and true recovery. I didn’t think my life could be this good but it’s amazing. ",1
"CMV: People that use the terms ""soy boy"" or ""cuck"" are highly insecure about their own masculinity.",5640,1123,2018-10-17 00:31:44,"Whenever I hear those terms I can't stop myself from imagining that person as a highly insecure person that tries to prove to themselves how masculine they are by making fun of people that remind themselves of their own self-perceived flaws.

"CMV: If you are still talking about Hillary Clinton in 2019, then you don't actually care about the United States.",5636,648,2019-10-02 21:51:06,"Hillary Clinton has had zero relevance in terms of any actual policy in this country since she lost her bid for President in 2016, and really not even since she ended her gig as Secretary of State in 2013. She hasn't done anything in that span other than write a book, tweet a few times, and spend time with her family, all of which are pretty normal things to do for any American citizen.

And yet, I STILL see people creating fresh slams against Hillary, new memes about her, more rhetoric about how good it is that she didn't win. This is YEARS after she stopped being important.

There is only one reason I can think of that explains why anyone still feels like Hillary Clinton is still relevant: that politics is a game where people win and lose, and the only thing that matters is that your side wins. This mentality IS NOT focused on the country as a whole, and I can't possibly imagine why fostering a deep division is really helping anything. It highlights that people view politics like they view sports, where all they really care about is winning, and what you do with that victory is not to use your gained power for good but rather to just gloat about the fact that you won.

Remember how Democrats kept on railing about Mitt Romney in 2015, two to three years after he lost? What, you don't? Well why not?! I mean, he ran for President, and lost, and I think the majority of Americans seem to be glad about that, so why is that any different from Hillary in 2019?? My response is that Democrats actually DO care about the direction of the country and want to win so that they CAN change the country for the better, and the fact that they left Mitt alone after he lost is proof of that. The fact that people still care about Hillary in 2019 is proof that these people don't actually care about the direction of the country, they only care that their side wins elections so they can feel better about themselves. Why else would Hillary still be relevant in 2019?

Edit: Lots of good dialogue here. Let me respond to some of the common points brought up.... First, the delta I awarded was on this point that she is ""not relevant"". I admit now that she IS relevant, but I still maintain that she is not any more relevant to current politics than any other retired Democratic politician. I don't take seriously this idea that she may run for office since she said so herself, and second-hand conjecture is not going to sway my opinion on that. 

More than anything else, it is that she is DISPROPORTIONATELY targeted by trolls in comparison to her relevance. It doesn't mean anything to me that people might discuss something she said recently. It's the fact that, in the general media sphere, I'll see more memes / complaints / discussions about Hillary than I will about really any other retired politician, and in some cases even more than someone who actually holds office right now. 

By the way, if people discuss things she said, that's fine. But when it becomes about her as a person, that's when I really scratch my head and wonder what the real goal is there. If she says something foolish, then one can easily disprove it. If you attack her instead, then what's that going to accomplish? 

And if she is actually guilty of anything, then why haven't any Republicans, with all their current wealth and power, managed to get any charges pressed against her? I haven't seen anyone address this point. I did see a super long hearing about Benghazi, a considerable and protracted effort, that tried to achieve this and failed. 

There ought to be more discussion about how I link obsession with Hillary to not caring about America. And I think the biggest point I want to make there is that Hillary Clinton IS. NOT. A. PRIORITY. for this country. And yet I see SO MUCH SHIT about her all the time, so much discussion, so many memes, so many insults, so many concerns about unfounded conspiracy theories and criminal charges that even the most powerful Republicans can't make. Look I don't even care if you're Republican, Democrat, green party supporter, libertarian, etc. I guarantee you that you probably have plenty of actual political priorities in this country, like our economy, immigration, health care, the climate, research and development, foreign relations, infrastructure. ALL of these things are so much more important and so vital to our country that I cannot help but think that anyone who actually thinks that Hillary is worth talking about in this political climate must clearly not care about ANY of those things, as I cannot otherwise explain how a person can rant and rave about a retired politician but then not have much to say about infrastructure in a country where some bridges just collapse out of the blue (I lived 2 blocks from the 35W bridge when it fell and drove on it daily). Or any other number of major problems, take your pick. I dare anyone to present an actual concern about Hillary Clinton that really is a bigger deal than anything I just mentioned.

"CMV: There needs to be 8 ""Chuggas"" before a ""Choo Choo""",5610,454,2019-09-19 22:55:46,"I got into a friendship-ruining debate the other day with my ex-best-friend.

*And that was the story of how me and my best friend parted ways to live our own lives.*

No I'm not really sweating about the whole ordeal, not everyone can be right like me, but it's been bugging me ever since 5 years ago, and I was just reminded about it when I saw this [Xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/851/) (by the way it's fucking 16 ""na's"" before ""Batman"" and not 8 Jesus christ I might have to argue about this next now).

I feel like maybe I've been brought up wrong and I'm conditioned to think differently to others. But what do you guys think?

&#x200B;

EDIT: This debate blew up far more than I thought it would (thanks for the golds) and now an argument that originally divided a friendship has now increasingly divided our already-divided country (what will we do?!)

That being said, I want to address some of the conclusions I've had for those of you who are interested.

Those who use:

**•** **1 or 3 'chuggas' before a 'choo-choo'** are clearly psychopaths that should have the privilege of counting taken away from them.

• **2 'chuggas'** This is also way too short and belongs to the first category but it sounds good to utter the phrase when you're doing your ultimate train punch move in an anime

**•** **Any odd number of 'chuggas'** belong in a post of r/foundsatan

**• 4** **'chuggas'** I kind of understand the rhythmic quality of it but I find it way too short to be satisfying

**• 6 'chuggas'** was a surprisingly popular one, many incorporated music theory to justify putting the 'choo-choo' in the last two beats of the second bar. It sounds just about right and I'm willing to concede that 6 is also an appropriate amount.

**• 8 'chuggas'** while 6 chuggas do find appealing I fell like the two bars filled up by the 4 chuggas each makes the ""choo-choo"" more satisfying as a kind of a reverse-pickup note. It gives it a more jazzy texture and rewards the listener for sticking to the end. For reference, try 16 chuggas and put the 'choo-choo' at the end. The four bars of build-up leading up to the conclusion makes the conclusion all the more satisfying.

**• Any integer over 8** ^(read more in #3 category)",1
CMV: Fans changing the last word (brave) of the National Anthem to the name of your sports team should be just as big of a deal as players kneeling during the anthem.,5557,543,2020-09-12 23:25:01,"There are a handful of professional sports teams that, during the National Anthem, their fans shout the name of the team over the word ""brave."" The Kansas City Chiefs is the first team that comes to mind for me. 

My point is: if you think it's okay to change a word in the anthem you should also think it's okay for players to kneel during the anthem. The first amendment could be cited as a reason to support both situations. 

Subsequently, if it infuriates you that players kneel during the anthem, it should also infuriate you that fans alter the words of the anthem. Respect for the country and respect for the people who have fought to defend the country could be cited as reasons to disagree with both situations.

Also, patriotically agreeing with kneeling but not agreeing with changing words of the anthem is another logical possibility. Your constitutional right to peaceful protest could be cited in this situation.",1
CMV: The USA is a dystopia,5502,1138,2020-03-15 00:08:11,"US citizens are indoctrinated from birth that the US is the best country in the world, the leader of the free world, the land of opportunity, the freest nation on earth, a place where anyone can achieve anything with hardwork, a morally righteous christian nation, an ideal democracy, etc. 


All of those are empirically lies. 


Dystopia - bad uptopia  or the opposite of a perfect society. 

This is the US.  We are indoctrinated to believe the US is a utopia, yet there is ample evidence we aren’t.  That seems to fit a bad or evil utopia. 


I don’t really want to discuss how we got here or if it was on purpose. I don’t want to entertain illuminati conspiracy bullshit. I honestly want someone to help me change my view. I’d love to discover this isn’t true, but atm I believe it is.

"CMV: there should be real-time, third-party fact-checking broadcast on-screen for major statements made during nationally broadcast debates.",5454,311,2020-10-08 10:15:09,"I'm using the US elections as my context but this doesn't just have to apply in the US. In the 2016 election cycle and again now in the 2020 debates, a lot of debate time is spent disagreeing over objective statements of fact. For example, in the October 7 VP debate, there were several times where VP Pence stated that VP Biden plans to raise taxes on all Americans and Sen. Harris stated that this is not true.

Change my view that the debates will better serve their purpose if the precious time that the candidates have does not have to devolve into ""that's not true""s and ""no they don't""s.

I understand that the debates will likely move on before fact checkers can assess individual statements, so here is my idea for one possible implementation: a quote held on-screen for no more than 30 seconds, verified as true, false, or inconclusive. There would also be a tracker by each candidate showing how many claims have been tested and how many have been factual. 

I understand that a lot of debate comes in the interpretations of fact; that is not what I mean by fact-checking. My focus is on binary statements like ""climate change is influenced by humans"" and ""President Trump pays millions of dollars in taxes.""",1
CMV: Political Debate has been destroyed by Strawmanning and Echo Chambers,5452,601,2020-06-10 08:09:41,"I am incredibly disillusioned with the state of political discourse online and irl. It seems to me there is very little space for meaningful debate across the left/right divide and it has only gotten worse. 

Problem 1: Straw-manning 

Two people cannot have a meaningful debate when they do not understand the other person's position. I'll choose a nice, non-controversial topic to demonstrate this: abortion. 

The pro-life opposes abortion because they think it is morally wrong to end a life and that fetuses constitute a life. They don't all agree about all the circumstances and they have a variety of arguments for this, but at the core that is their position. 

The pro-choice side has two distinct stances: 1. abortion is not wrong because a fetus is not a life/does not trump a woman's bodily autonomy or 2. Legalized abortion is a lesser evil when compared to the ramifications of making it illegal. 

Of course people don't actually argue about these positions. 

The pro-life side calls pro-choice ""baby killers"" accuse them of genocide and eugenics and become susceptible to outrageous claims like abortion being a for-profit industry and fetal tissue ending up in Pepsi cola. 

The pro-choice side claims that pro-lifers want to control women, want them never to have sex and prefer them dying from back alley abortions to having a safe and legal one. 

Both are strawmen, which are much easier to argue against than the actual positions. 

Problem 2: Social media amplifies extreme views

Nobody generated enormous traffic for measured and nuances views. These views are then found by the other side and used to paint the entire opposition with. This seems self explanatory

Problem 3: Echo chambers

Conservative and liberal/left thinkers barely interact except to fling insults, slogans and misinformation with each other. The only places for real discussion are ""safe spaces"" typified by subreddits. R/politics for liberals, r/conservative for cons. This is a great way for people to share content and views that confirm their own biases without challenge. People on these subs don't see their opponents explain their positions, they see them misrepresented by people they already agree with. So on the occasions they do interact with people outside the echo chambers, they are primed not to listen to a word they say. When you bring in discussions of biased media and fake news, it gets even worse. 

""You're a looney leftist who hates cops, I don't have to listen to you""

""You're a racist homophobe, I don't have to listen to you""

Conclusion:

I don't make this post because I'm a moderate or centrist or because both sides are equally bad. If I did think that, it'd be a lot easier not to care about this. But I'm concerned if we lose the ability to debate we lose the ability to progress as a society. I hope it's not too late but I increasingly feel that it is.",1
CMV: Removing or changing Apu in The Simpsons isn't constructive to South Asian stereotypes,5445,880,2018-10-31 21:29:39,"This post stems mainly from the developments around Hari Kondabolu and his view of Apu (in essence, for those unaware, he made a documentary called ""The Problem With Apu"", where he and a bunch of guests talk about their experiences of Apu and how it affected them). He talks about the fact that Apu should be made less of a stereotype and given more character development e.g. via getting ownership of the Kwik-E-Mart, as well as not having racist undertones e.g. Hank Azaria voicing him, being replaced by a South Asian actor instead. Also worth pointing out here and now (not that it should change anything) that I'm also of South Asian ethnicity, living in the UK.

&#x200B;

So my view is this: focusing on the ""Apu problem"" entirely misses the wider point on racism and stereotypes. Almost every character on The Simpsons is satirical, being an exaggerated version of a real-life archetype. But we aren't having the discussion about the ""Fat Tony/Luigi problem"" or the ""Groundskeeper Willie problem"", or the ""Bumblebee man problem"". The list goes on basically forever. So why is that? Maybe it's because those are coming next. But I'm thinking it's because (to use the Fat Tony/Luigi example) other archetypes have representation in a non-caricatured way in popular media (or at the least, in a more varied way - think ""The Sopranos""/""The Godfather"" for more gritty representations, through to ""Happy Days"" for benign comedy). South Asians, on the other hand, have very few. When Apu first appeared on screens, there was virtually no other representation; nowadays, there are more actors representing (e.g. Kal Penn/Aziz Ansari/Mindy Kaling). Even so, the characters tend to be either outright plays to the established tropes, or in comedy roles. It's also relatively unusual to see South Asian actors/actresses on screen in roles that don't showcase their ethnicity.

&#x200B;

So, in essence, my view is this: Apu is a caricature on a show full of caricatures. The reason we get racist slurs as a minority (the standard ""thank you, come again"" etc.) is because there is little to no representation outside of comedy, as with other ethnicities/populations. Removing Apu/editing him serves no purpose here, and misses the point of The Simpsons; the way to improve things is to make characters that aren't just ethnic props. CMV.

"CMV: Being gay is nothing to be proud of, because it isn't an achievement. Pride in being gay is as meaningful as pride in your place of birth. Gay pride tribalizes the gay community and creates stereotypes against them, harming LGBT individuals who do not participate in the pride culture.",5356,652,2019-01-04 03:51:50,"Pretty stoned, just thinking about humans, when the topic of pride came across my mind. I encounter prideful people all the time, both in real life and of course the internet. Pride seems to be considered a virtue and a vice at the same time. Pride goes beyond self-acceptance. It is the assertion of your own identity onto others. Telling others that you're proud of your child is basking in the glory of what you believe to be good parenting. Telling others that you're proud of them is being happy that you can associate yourself with an individual that you deem worthy.

Pride by nature is self-centered, which isn't a bad thing for humans. Pride is a good incentive for competition and allows us to continue innovating the way we do.

But then I thought, ""What about gay pride?"" Why would a gay man be proud to be gay? It's simply how they were born and raised. They had no choice in being gay; they just are. Of course, when a person used to say ""I'm proud to be gay"", what they really meant was ""I'm proud to be brave"", because there used to be a huge stigma against gay people. Fortunately in 2019, gay pride is not as dangerous to those who are openly gay. People in San Francisco do not need to worry about scrutiny for their annual pride parades, which means that at this point they're merely celebrating their sexuality. It doesn't seem to be an issue of pride anymore, but an issue of bragging rights (essentially saying ""I am gay and I love to celebrate the fact that I can be gay"").

It's a new type of pride; pride in one's tribe. With that in mind, I think that it is a meaningless type of pride, since being gay isn't an achievement. It is as meaningless as being proud to be born as an American, or being proud to be born White. With each pride parade, the ""pride community"" also develops stereotypes on the basis that they are the loud minority of gay people. Not all gay people are proud of being gay; they simply are gay and go on with their lives without needing a pride parade. As a result, gay people have been stereotyped as flamboyant, overly promiscuous party animals that do not actually fit the characteristic of every gay person.

So, Reddit. Please change my view. Should gay pride still be a thing in areas where the bravery component is a non-issue? If so, why should gay pride still be a thing?

Edited : Updated 2018--> 2019. Also semantics/grammar.

Edit 2: While I have been convinced that the term ""pride"" is not used to describe actual pride, but a colloquial sense of belonging and expressing happiness, it still seems to me that some people in the comments are trying to convince me why one *should* be proud. I have not yet found a convincing reason for one to be *proud* of being gay, but do agree with the colloquial definition of pride in ""Gay Pride"" to mean ""Happy to be able to be gay"".

Edit3: /u/MrTouchnGo explained this very well. Bravo. Being proud of being gay is a self realization, overcoming implicit heteronormative values, and has less to do with direct interactions with other people. People are mean to each other *regardless of being gay or straight*. What I truly admire at this point, is the ability to transition from self loathing to self acceptance. And I see that this is what gay pride is all about. Be proud!",1

CMV: The fact that minors pay taxes on earned wages and yet cannot vote is unjust and does not follow the spirit of America’s founding.,5318,609,2020-10-15 09:19:47,"My view is that minors being taxed on earned wages and not given a vote at any level of government is inherently unjust, and does not follow the spirit of America’s founding, of which “no taxation without representation” was a major factor. 

I do not wish for my view to be misunderstood as that I support minors voting, of any age really. As a general rule I do not support minors having a vote of any age. However, I do not believe that you can tax a class of people that have not committed a felony at the same rates as any legal adult and not afford the right of voting to them.

While the post is not about a solution to this, it is for my mind to be changed about why the current dynamic is not inherently unjust, I would like to clarify what options I believe would be available, as it gives a better understanding of my mindset. 

I believe you could afford minors that pay taxes on earned wages or other income types the right to vote. I would not be overly enthusiastic about this option but I would suspect the judgement of working teens will on average be at least a bit better. 

I believe you could lower the tax rate for minors or abolish it completely. Personally I would advocate for the abolishment of taxing working teenagers if they will not be able to vote, but I don’t believe there’d ever be an untaxed group of working Americans ever. So a reduced tax rate for minors seems like a good middle ground.

I don't really give a shit that people think the earth is flat, I might ask them about why they believe that but in the end their mind is set and it's just wasted energy trying to argue about it.

CMV: The pro and anti-pineapple pizza debate is meaningless so long as the real enemy of the people continues to exist: Big Anchovy,5228,367,2020-08-02 03:57:31,"Back in the 80s and early 90s, if you wanted to gross someone out with pizza, you'd put anchovies on it. In theory, fish shouldn't be terrible on pizza. Maybe a nice salmon bake, maybe some crab. It could work.

But it didn't.

But did Big Anchovy remove the product from market? No. The contracts were already in place. Pizza suppliers already owned the fish so they did their best to use it.

Once the contracts ran out, though, Big Anchovy wasn't doing so well since pizza places weren't ordering any more. But what's worse, anchovy pizza's been totally demonized and no one... NO ONE is buying it anymore.

The last thing Big Anchovy needs is their respective brands being hated on. So they come up with an ingredient that could never work and start marketing it: pineapple.

The idea is, if Big Anchovy can get people to hate on pineapple pizza more than anchovy pizza, they can distract from all the hate they get and keep out of the negative attention and bide their time for when Big Anchovy can do a relaunch, maybe in a few years.

The problem is, for some reason, people ended up loving pineapple on pizza. Now, I'm not here to argue for or against pineapple on pizza. I get the idea behind the flavor combinations. I get why some may like it and others not and for the purposes of this post, I'm taking a completely neutral stance on it.

Big Anchovy, though, is still up to their old games. They constantly make posts and memes taking both sides of the argument in the pro/anti pineapple debate, increasing rhetoric and polarization simply for the purpose of misdirecting the hate of the people away from anchovy pizza.

"CMV: The anti-science that is rampant today is largely due to people using appeal to authority as an argument and not actually citing studies, data, and research.",5166,312,2020-05-10 22:14:31,"In the early to mid 2000s I saw the early stages of the rampant anti-science movement we have today emerging from the likes of Alex Jones. 

One friend of mine had begun muttering some nonsense about global warming being a hoax and citing studies he took directly off one of Alex Jones' pages so I invited my meteorologist friend to his house for a discussion.  During the discussion the meteorologist went through all of the data cited and gave his counterpoints with data.  Surprisingly he didn't necessarily dismiss all of the ""denial"" data but gave his scientific perspective on it. At the end he managed to change the ""deniers"" perspective and they now not only act consciously in the world but also share the information at their disposal.

Fast forward to 2014 and my son was about to be born amidst all of the anti-vaxx hype.  My sister in law was very anti-vaxx and would give my wife and I countless studies to read.

"CMV: The Fact That Innocent People Have Been Convicted in the US Proves Juries Need Better Instruction on What ""Beyond a Reasonable Doubt"" Means",5171,287,2020-04-07 22:21:53,"[To date there have been at least 367 wrongfully convicted defendants exonerated as the result of DNA evidence](https://www.innocenceproject.org/dna-exonerations-in-the-united-states/). And though they spent an average of fifteen years behind bars, those are the lucky ones. We don't know how many more wrongfully convicted people sit in jail today because there is no funding to pursue their case or there simply is no DNA evidence available. The fact that ANY defendants are wrongfully convicted in a system that is supposed to presume innocence and where guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt is my main concern here. I take the fact that so many are wrongfully convicted as evidence that juries just do not understand the basic underpinnings of our legal system and need better instructions.

First, it should literally be impossible to prove something happened beyond a reasonable doubt if it, in fact, did not happen. You might feel pretty sure that something that didn't happen happened, you might believe something that didn't happen probably happened, but you should never be in a situation where you believe ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" that something that didn't happen happened.

That hundreds of juries apparently came to these conclusions suggests that there are serious problems with how jurors are instructed. I think that there are two places where these poor instructions need to be addressed.

First, jurors and our legal system in general do not seem willing to take into account how unreliable eye witness accounts are. Nearly 70% of the wrongful convictions mentioned above involved misleading or misidentified eye witness testimony. [Psychologists have known for a long time that we have bad memories.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-the-eyes-have-it/) Even people who are CERTAIN they are telling the truth, and in fact ARE telling the truth as they remember it, are in fact incorrect. Juries need to be made aware of this when they evaluate testimony. You shouldn't need to call an expert psychologist in every case. This should just be standard jury instruction, maybe part of a juror introduction packet if you will. Also, the reliability or unreliability of other kinds of evidence (forensic tests, etc) should be included in instruction to the jury.

Second, it is insane that many states outright refuse to define what ""beyond a reasonable doubt means."" I argue that better instructions should be given to jurors about this phrase. In every case where someone is innocent, reasonable doubt should exist because the crime literally didn't happen. That means the prosecution is relying on circumstantial or eye witness testimony to make their case. In every one of these instances, it is reasonable to doubt that the person committed the crime.

Third, it may also be necessary to improve the representation of defendants. One could argue that reasonable doubt didn't exist based on the cases presented even with the best instructions. If that is the case we need to expand our public defender offices so every defendant gets the kind of defense that can explain just why the prosecution's evidence is doubtful.

I expect that some will come back with ""well if you took that definition seriously"" then we would let a lot of guilty people go free. I agree. I think it is a greater harm to imprison and potentially kill an innocent person than it is to let a guilty person go free. **Presumption of innocence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt is our standard. If we take this seriously, an innocent person should never, ever be convicted. The fact that innocent people HAVE been convicted means we need to make one or all of the changes above. Change my view.**

&#x200B;

Edit: Never expected so many responses!  A lot of them are really good but I want to respond to a few of the KINDS of responses all at once as I can't get to all of these.

1) ""If we actually adopt this standard we'll never convict anyone!""

The practical implications of juries really understanding when it is reasonable to doubt something are not what I'm arguing here. It may be that if juries really understood this we would never convict anyone. If that's the case you could argue we shouldn't use the ""innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt"" standard, but it's not an argument against my original post which is IF juries got better instructions we would have no convictions of innocent people. Having no convictions of ANY people is actually consistent with this view even if you find such a world objectionable.

2) ""What would YOU consider beyond a reasonable doubt?""

The honest answer is I'm not sure. Given what I know about the fallibility of the human memory, the legal system and forensic evidence, it is actually hard to think of a scenario where there is NOT a reasonable doubt as to someone's guilt. That is why I conclude that juries either must not KNOW about these things or they just don't care. Or they know and care but care more about making sure bad guys go to jail. ",1

CMV: A middle class person is better off living in a small EU country than in US,5075,749,2020-10-09 16:13:04,"This is not really US bashing, it is actually related to a personal choice, and by explaining my thought process I think I am able to represent an average person here (don't get me wrong, my ego is big and I don't think of my self as average in most cases, but in terms of lifestyle and class I certainly think I am.) I also don't want to discuss Trump at all. I recently had a debate with someone who still thinks US provides the most to people who live in it, so I want to see what can US give me that would make me want to live there instead of my (very unimpressive) Country.

I am Croatian, our country had a war, is now in EU, our politicians are generally incompetent, we are no economic force, our salaries are not impressive. I find it beautiful, but I also find US beautiful and I won't be discussing emotional reasons to live in either place here. Just saying, I'm not from Scandinavia or Germany to rightfully brag about doing things ""better"" than the US, but most European countries (even those not in EU) share certain privileges. 

I am university educated with a Masters at the moment, it didn't cost me anything, and I have work experience in one unrelated but very solid field. However while this maybe puts me a bit above average, I am not an entrepreneur (like most people aren't) and have no interest or ability to run my own business. I also don't need to make tons of money. I of course appreciate a good salary and want to be able to live a sustainable, self reliant, comfortable and safe lifestyle  but for me that means - owning an apartment/place to live, not having debt, having retirement savings, being protected in cases of sickness or medical emergencies, being able to pay bills, go out, take courses in something that interests me, travel affordably, have IKEA furniture and wear H&M. Nothing extravagant, because I realistically don't need it and it doesn't motivate me. 

I also care about work life balance A LOT. I want to have free time for myself, for my interests, for people. I don't want my job dominating my life. Most people don't. We need time off, we need vacations. I fear that if I go to US, I will lose generous vacation time and work will be much more intense. I would probably not have a month off or more every year and limitless sick days. I will make more money, but everything will be more expensive and I will desperately depend on my job for medical insurance (so if I quit or lose my job for a short while, I can't get sick?).  I'd rather be unemployed somewhere where it doesn't threaten my livelihood than working somewhere where I can't afford to quit. 

&#x200B;

This brings me to medical insurance. I do understand that while US doesn't have a free health care, you are often insured through work? But many are not. I saw tons of people on reddit explain how much they got into debt because of an accident that involved emergency (so not like they had a choice not to go).  It also seems that your insurance plan might not cover many things if you're not rich which leads to so many movie and show plots where characters have to do something crazy to afford healthcare for themselves or loved one. I hear the argument about being able to choose your doctors but none of it makes sense to me, what do I need to choose for? If I am sick, the ONLY thing I want is that I am helped and cured and that I don't have to worry about money during that. People still have private providers if they want to pay for some additional comforts - but even those private providers aren't that expensive in comparison because they still have to make sense to people who are getting it for free. 

Now, I don't want kids which saves me a lot of problems. But the majority of people do, so let's also explore what that would mean. If I wanted to have a kid in my shitty country, I would not need to be rich. My medical expenses would be covered. Kindergardens are cheap or even free (I will mention, but not focus on the cultural element too where most of us get tremendous help from our families allowing people more free time, but to an extent that is not a guarantee for all). I head that childcare in US is so expensive that often one parent has to stop working because they simply can't manage it. So in the country where without money you're nothing, one person has to lose their job and the other has to better not end up losing it no matter how bad it gets. 

Then we'd have t think about school. Public schools in my country and a lot of Europe are better than private schools, and poor kids and rich kids attend them together (usually when rich kids go to a private school its because they weren't good students in a public school). So the equal opportunity is literally there. I wouldn't have to save ridiculous sums I'd much rather have in my own savings for college because a kid will go into college by merit. And if I do need to put my kid in a private college because they were bad academically and I don't want them to do a trade school (which btw lead to very good employment opportunities and should not be dismissed), it won't be expensive because again, it's competing with free stuff. 

Americans will now say that at least their higher education is the best in world. Ok. I think our free universities are very good too but objectively yes, expensive private universities can afford state of the art facilities and renowned professionals who come and teach. But the class plays such a huge role in where someone will end up. There are some scholarships to keep up the appearance but from what I understand many of the US public schools are very poor quality (or the quality ones require you to live in a certain limited location), while rich kids get prepared from early on. A good public school student who maybe won't get a special scholarship because they aren't extraordinary in sport (what does that have to do with anything?) or in any other way that will get huge attention will be worse off than a bad private school student, because in the end while merit might help a small minority, money will help everyone to get their place even if they're not academically gifted at all. It seems to me that these amazing colleges just serve to give credibility to the already rich who will go on being rich anyway (so that they can pretend that they're actually smart cause they went to Harvard), and maintain the illusion that even the poor/middle class can do it if they work hard enough. 

My final point I know the least about is property. In my country most of us own property - poor, middle class, upper middle class, all have some property they inherited or are able to buy apartments for their kids. During the socialist time many people were given property - my grandpa used his completely average middle class Yugoslavia salary to buy each of his kids an apartment, a big house on the seaside etc. I understand that maybe this was an extraordinary situation and market isn't like that, but I also don't understand why Americans need huge houses and cars and debt either. Maybe this is more lifestyle issue than something that belongs here. But the debt part - I understand you are forced to use a credit card in america or else you don't get access to housing loans. So a person who doesn't buy into the whole consumerism and wants to save money is actually penalized the one time they need to loan to buy property and stop renting. 

You will point out that none of these things are free and we all pay more taxes. Sure, but again, for an average person's average salary with the taxes deducted from it, we get healthcare, education, retirement, care in cases of emergencies and good social programmes as a support through hard times. If your goal is to be an entrepreneur, get filthy rich and don't want too many limitations or taxes because you don't have to give a shit, maybe US is the place for you. 

But most people, including smart and educated people, want a good life. They want balance, they want to be safe, they want their family to be taken care of, they want the freedom to quit a bad job or get sick without going bankrupt, they want time to themselves and people in their lives. i just don't see how the US provides that.

Tl;dr I don't think US is a good place for most people to live in because it forces you to have to be rich to have a decent life. I don't really see what I'd get as an average/middle class person in the US and think life for that group is better in almost any European country (including small, economically weaker ones). I don't think pursuit of money is really a choice in that context and i don't think it's a great way to live a life",1
"CMV: I don't care what other people say; WALL·E is a cinema classic, and is much smarter than many of the supposed ""adult"" movies. It must be considered part of high cinema.",5031,267,2020-03-24 09:17:28,"Yes, WALL·E is a great masterpiece in my opinion. People who claim that mediocre adult movies like The Titanic are better because they're popular, traumatic, sexy, violent etc are extremely shallow. Don't get me wrong: Movies with blood and sex like Pulp Fiction also deserve their place, but that's not the primary reason they're there. WALL·E perhaps gives one of the most daring messages that a kids' movie can give about capitalism, consumerism, and globalization. It also touches on topics like separation of human and nature (and drawing the line with words such as ""foreign contaminant""), willful surrender of human autonomy, and laziness. Stupidity of pop culture and its blind observance by the masses, indoctrination from young ages, and a disregard and indifference to knowledge about the past, or even the present moment are also explored in the movie. But, from the very basics, designs and visuals of the robots are top-notch to start with. It's perhaps reasonable to think that this is not a CGI movie and that WALL·E is an actual robot in the first part of the movie. WALL·E's design is so basic, so retro, so crude, yet its ability to move in a million different ways without sacrificing any of these qualities, its ability express many different human-like qualitied with such a simple engineering is the real killer. It's as if the robot's actually there, and you think why nobody has ever done something like that before, because it's just too smart. Again, our deuteragonist EVE's design is also pretty cool. It represents beauty in such a unique way. All in all, the design elements and the storytelling make this movie top notch, but there's probably much more things about it that I haven't mentioned yet that make this movie so damn great.",1
cmv: the best way to fix the injustice in US court systems is to make the victim and the accused person anonymous to the judge and jury.,5001,458,2020-04-08 16:10:37,"CMV: People say justice is blind, but for some people, that doesn’t seem to be the case. Discrimination based on appearance and gender can often distort justice and harm the nation as a whole.
As such, the best way to combat this discrimination is to not let the judge know anything about these people other than the crimes they may or may not have committed and the evidence for and against it. The judge should not know the appearance, gender, or any other physical trait except for injuries relevant to the crime. Of course they would still have access to criminal records, but those should also have names and photos redacted for the purpose of judging them in a new trial. 
As such, a new anonymous form of justice would be the best way of determining how our society gets justice for its victims and it’s falsely accused.",1
CMV: Selectively breeding animals with genetic defects should be illegal,4996,516,2018-11-16 21:39:39,"This post is prompted by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/9xgtbm/albino_turtle_born_with_a_window_to_its_heart/?st=JOK22NV3&sh=10412001) one, which shows a baby albino turtle born with an open heart cavity. Turns out it is the product of extensive selective albino inbreeding by [these assholes](https://instagram.com/thealbinocollection?utm_source=ig_profile_share&igshid=1t7me6eyw66v5). 

Albinism is heavily correlated with birth defects, health issues, and drastically shorter lifespans. I see no reason why this should be legal, and I think this should extend to the breeding of dogs that have respiratory and other issues because we think they’re cute. Creating new breeds and varieties of animals that are born to suffer (**edit per u/itsaworkalt: purely for profit/vanity and not for medical research, etc.**) is pure animal abuse.

CMV: News coverage is now so poor that following the news will actually make you less informed about reality than ignoring it.,4952,297,2019-07-04 00:16:17,"In the last year, I've found myself very reluctantly coming to the conclusion that there is no longer any point whatsoever in attempting to stay informed by watching, reading or listening to any mainstream news sources no matter its position on the political spectrum.  

While occasional examples of good journalism or rare investigative articles can be found from nearly any source, I believe that any relevant information you can learn from these rare cases is massively outweighed by the sheer quantity of misinformation and propaganda that you are exposed to in discovering them.  My core points are the following:

* The introduction of social media and click-driven internet traffic have created a perverse environment where good journalism is punished and bad journalism heavily rewarded.  
* The increased competition and pressure on the media from the above has resulted in the downsizing of traditional news rooms.  Unfortunately, the first positions to be lost were specialist technical and expert positions, meaning most journalists are no longer knowledgeable on the fields they are assigned to report on.
* Governments and politicians have learned increasingly effective methods of propaganda in the last decade which news sources either have no interest in counteracting or no ability to counteract.  The truth is now indistinguishable from lies.
* Even if, somehow, you manage to spend enough time and energy extracting the truth from the lies, you will be shouted over by the many more people who believe the lie and believe it firmly.  Politics has become so polarized that the truth is irrelevant.

That's the brief summary.  To clarify in more depth the reasons why I believe the above:

&#x200B;

**The Internet is a perverse environment**

Clickbait is the best example of the perverse incentives created by the way news media is now funded.  It appears abundantly clear to me that the media will report stories and articles they know to be misleading or downright false simply because they know they generate outrage and traffic.  This has always been true to some extent or another, throughout history newspapers have been making money from peddling outrage.  However, until recent years there was a genuine effort by ""respectable"" news sources not to lower themselves to this kind of coverage.  I can no longer find any news sources which still seem to make this effort.  The economics of the internet mean that news sources can no longer survive at all without publishing false stories and clickbait in an effort to drive traffic to their website.

**Expertise is dead**

As part and parcel of the contraction of the media, all news companies have been forced to downsize and the first places to suffer staffing and budget cuts have been the least profitable and more niche departments.  Media companies are no longer willing to pay high salaries to journalists with strong expertise in specific areas.  This is a longer term trend which has been happening for decades even before the internet completely eclipsed paper journalism; the cumulative effect of it over time is that nearly every news article is produced by someone with no specialist knowledge or experience whatsoever.  Errors and complete ignorance of an article's topic are commonplace and chances are any article you read on a technical topic is either lifted wholesale from a press release or published by someone with no further knowledge or understanding than any random member of the public.

**Propaganda**

This is such a broad topic and with so much written on it that I don't feel that I have the space to go into it here.  For the sake of simplicity, I'll stick to one propaganda strategy by way of an example:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firehose\_of\_falsehood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firehose_of_falsehood)

I believe that the firehose of falsehood has become an incredibly widespread tool within politics, both national and international.  I also believe that there has been a complete and utter failure by the media to counteract it and it may be completely impossible for any media source to counteract this strategy.  

The proliferation of this propaganda strategy is one of the key reasons I believe that it is not worth trying to stay informed any more - the more you expose yourself to journalism as it currently stands, the more vulnerable you are to manipulation using this strategy.

**Polarization**

Humans are poor at separating a convenient lie from an inconvenient truth at the best of times.  We are exceptionally good at choosing to believe what we would prefer to believe rather than what the evidence shows to be true.  This has been true since the dawn of time, but the increased polarization arising from the internet driving us into bubbles has destroyed the only countermeasure to this - regular exposure to people we disagree with.  The effect of this is that even if I somehow manage to discover the truth behind the falsehoods, it's a useless truth.  It can't be spread to anyone other than the people who are already inclined to believe it because the majority of people now openly reject even objective facts which contradict their political position.

I'll also add that on this point I won't be convinced by the ""What if everyone thought that way?"" argument as I have no control what other people think.  To quote Catch 22:

 ""But, Yossarian, suppose everyone felt that way.""  
""Then,"" said Yossarian, ""I'd certainly be a damned fool to feel any other way, wouldn't I?”     

&#x200B;

I can elaborate on these views further if need be.  On a personal level, I myself was always someone who tried very hard to recognize the truth behind media sources, despite the problems with journalism and reporting that have always existed.  My previous belief was that even if falsehoods were widespread, it was possible to slowly change peoples minds as long as you have a good understanding of the facts and could give people information without being judgmental or overly zealous.  

It's only fairly recently that I've come to the depressing conclusion that it's now futile to try this and it's better to completely give up on trying to cut through the wall of bullshit produced by the media.  The only hope I currently hold for this is that as older generations who are unfamiliar with the internet die off, newer generations will be much more prepared for and capable of adjusting their thinking to avoid being mislead by false information.  However this is only a hope and I can see no evidence that younger generations are less prone to being mislead than older generations.",1
CMV: The NBA should not support the black lives matter movement while censoring other important social justice issues like the Hong Kong democracy protests.,4917,375,2020-07-14 18:53:52,"First off, I want to say that I do support the black community and I do think that athletes should use their platform to promote social justice in their community. However, when Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, tweeted out an image that voiced support for protests in Hong Kong, the NBA publicly apologised to China, calling the image 'regrettable'. The NBA has censored player's support for the pro democracy protests, concerned that the loss of chinese viewers, sponsors and leagues would impact revenue. Recently, the NBA released a list of pre-approved political messages, including ‘I Can’t Breathe’ ‘Black Lives Matter’ etc. These are important social justice statements, however, it is wrong that they will not allow players to support any other social justice issue, issues like the Hong Kong democracy protests. Where is the line drawn? The NBA needs to either allow their players to make social justice statements without being censored, or, they should not allow social justice statements at all.

&#x200B;

Edit: 

Alright, thanks for everyone's responses, I'd encourage you to keep on discussing this, there is some really great dialogue in the comments section that's worth a read.

I am still frustrated that the NBA is capitalising on social justice and the idea of 'standing for something, even if it costs everything'. However, as a few have pointed out, the NBA is a organisation that wants to make money, and they are within their rights to prioritise issues that will benefit them financially.

I will go through and award Delta's to the posts that made me reconsider my original statement.

I have changed my view on the following points:

1. I agree that it is better that the NBA support one social issue than none at all.
2. I agree that since the NBA is not an entity that has moral obligations, they do not have a duty to prioritise social justice. They have the right to support social justice issues that will make them money.

I really value a lot of your contributions, it made my day to see so many aware of the financial motivations of 'woke' institutions that want to portray themselves as champions of human rights. It's not just the NBA that are doing this, just look at the Apple's 'Morning Show'. As Ricky Gervais said at the Golden Globes it's  ""a superb drama about the importance of dignity and doing the right thing, made by a company that runs sweatshops in China."" Reading from other Redditors that see through the portrayed image of these corporations has restored a little bit of my faith in the general public. But maybe it's just the people in this community that have their thinking hats on. Thankyou everyone!",1
"CMV: Dr. Phil and similar TV shows are the modern, socially acceptable equivalent of circus freak shows",4902,189,2019-02-12 03:57:19,"Old circus freak shows took people with unusual disabilities or physical conditions and put them on display for people to gawk at. Today (at least in first world countries) that kind of thing would be unacceptable because of how degrading it is to the ""performers"".

Shows like Dr. Phil are not much different from a freak show. Many people appearing on the show are clearly in need of therapy and Dr. Phil is a psychologist but I feel like this is just a facade used to make viewers feel like this is an acceptable way of presenting people with mental disorders on television. I don't feel like any therapist would recommend for a therapy session to be conducted in front of millions of people. On top of that recently it appears that people are being rewarded with social media stardom for their unusual behavior which is probably the opposite of what is needed for their health.

And just to be clear I think it is important to show people with mental and physical disabilities in media and there are respectful ways of doing it. Dr. Phil and similar shows are just not it.",1
"CMV: r/changemyview is the only large subreddit (over 100k subscribers) where opposing ideas are discussed, not immediately condemned.",4901,403,2019-08-23 00:36:51,"I've been going through some political subreddits (bad idea I know) looking for one where people discuss politics as opposed to posting clickbait/memes, then bashing anyone who comments something other than ""this post is 100% correct"".

I tried googling ""centrist reddit"" to see if there were any subs that have moderate views, which led me to r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM, which turned out to be a sub to bash people who say there is value in being politically moderate.

Now I'm wondering if, just by the nature of reddit, no other subreddit has discussions like CMV, because it's like minded people looking for like minded groups. Even if the sub started with reasonable people, certain views are reinforced continuously and others are demonized, until the sub will only tolerate stances the group has agreed upon.

CMV: Men and women who make false rape claims should be forced to register as sex offenders.,4891,497,2018-03-28 07:47:28,"Before I begin my argument I'd like to establish this first. When I say false rape claims I do not mean cases like [Rapist Brock Turner's Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_v._Turner) where it's a safe assumption based on the evidence that they committed the crime yet somehow get away with it. I am not trying to dissuade actual victims. If you are a victim seek legal action if you haven't already.

I mean cases where evidence of the claim is either completely unfounded and/or falsified or it is later found out that the claims made against the accused where false. Cases such as:


[Jemma Belle](http://www.thejournal.ie/woman-makes-false-rape-sexual-assault-claims-innocent-men-3482764-Jul2017/) who...

> Within the space of four years, Beale claimed she had been seriously sexually assaulted by six men and raped by nine, all strangers, in four different attacks.

[Response from one of the men she accused](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-surrey-11676804)

[Karen Farmer](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-33391739)

[The *A Rape on Campus* Rolling Stone article by Sabrina Erdely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Rape_on_Campus) where a gang rape claim against the local chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity. (I'm a member at another chapter so I personal stake with this one)

[The claim against Aziz Ansari](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/01/the-humiliation-of-aziz-ansari/550541/) (No presses charged but you can see the effect it had on his life)


I could go on but I'll stop there. In most of these cases the false accuser was punished to some capacity, however it's not enough. Making false claims of rape is just as destructive as committing the act. Where a victim of actual sexual violence might experience both physical and psychological trauma that effects their daily life and/or may face backlash in their socialite in one way or another; the victim of a false accusation faces something similar nature. They are blackballed from society and socially ostracized for actions they did not commit. Even if justice comes their way the damage is already done and you can never truly get rid of that brand. It also makes finding justice for actual victims much harder. Much like how the abuse of a medicine (like Adderall, opioids, etc.) makes it harder by placing more scrutiny on people that would actually benefit from it; the same can be said about false rape claims.

Now, why make them register as sex offenders? Well thats fairly simple; if an individual is willing enough to construct a falsified claim as a way to deface and/or imprison an innocent man or woman' then they clearly not meant to be trusted by society, their workplace (current or future), and anywhere else they could easily inflict damage on more innocent people.

So what do you think? Do you disagree? Am I being too harsh or not harsh enough? I'm interested in hearing what you have to say.

Change my mind. (As they say)


Edit: Formatting

Edit: I'll get to as many of your responses as possible. Fact checking the counter arguments (both yours and mine)

**Important Edit:** A lot of you are asking how would you go about finding if the claim was false. I did some digging and here is a Journal of psychology that proposes a way to discern fact from truth. They state: ""We propose a new theory based on the literature, the theory of fabricated rape. The theory of fabricated rape predicts that differences between the story of a false complainant and a true victim will arise because a false complainant has to fabricate an event that was not experienced and a true victim can rely on recollections of the event. On the one hand, the false complainant is lying and will behave as liars do. On the other hand, she is constructing a story based on her own experiences and her beliefs concerning rape. If the experiences do not resemble rape and the beliefs concerning rape are not valid, detectable differences between a true story of rape and a false story of rape, a fabricated rape, will arise. The current study will test the validity of a list of differing characteristics between false and true allegations constructed based on the suggested theory of fabricated rape""

CMV: Children need to be taught to beware of family as much as they're of strangers,4885,213,2020-07-29 16:36:19,"I'm not advocating to scare children in to being afraid of their family. I'm proposing ways where we could train them in to handling such situations effectively and I'm completely against the fact that there is no such plan as mainstream as ""Stranger Danger"" to handle familial sexual abuse.

It's not major news that a significant portion of child sexual abuse arises from family members and other known individuals. 

>Estimates vary, but not widely – somewhere between 8% and 12% of children in the US have experienced sexual abuse  
[Source: The Guardian (1)](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/datablog/2019/aug/03/us-children-sexual-abuse-data-stats-estimate)  
Edit: Revised statistic at the end of post


>Contrary to other types of abuse, research suggests that a far greater number of child sexual abuse offences are perpetrated by adults who are not in a caregiver role (ABS, 2005; US DHHS, 2005). Findings from the ABS Personal Safety Survey (2005) indicated that for participants who had experienced sexual abuse before the age of 15, only 13.5% identified that the abuse came from their father/stepfather, 30.2% was perpetrated by other male relative, 16.9% by family friend, 15.6% by acquaintance/neighbour, and 15.3% by other known person (ABS, 2005)
[Source: Child family community Australia - factsheet](https://aifs.gov.au/cfca/publications/who-abuses-children)


While we have taken adequate measures and might have prevented such abuse from strangers by teaching children common practises such as ""stranger danger"", I've not been able to find evidence of children being educated on how the close circle of family and friends may be more likely to house such nefarious individuals.

Perhaps parents feel that it might cause their children to distrust every family member they meet or they don't want to create an atmosphere of fear at every Christmas party but that doesn't alter the fact that creating a fanciful environment for a child makes him more vulnerable to the machinations of a proximate predator.

I wonder if teaching stories from the Grimm fairy tales might have actually not been a bad idea in the middle ages when children were highly prone to being exploited. Granted, they've an excessive level of violence and gore, likely since adults aren't sure how to ensure that children grasp the seriousness of certain situations. Certainly, a partially diluted version or an interactive version of the same could be used to teach children the possible dangers of sexual abuse from trusted individuals.

Parents have forgotten their childhood memories and need to relearn how it is to be a child and grow up everyday. A better understanding of their child may allow parents to better communicate such dangers without scarring or depressing them.

PLEASE READ:

I'm not advocating to scare children in to distrusting everyone. However, sitting idly by is definitely just as bad. My view is that we need a method that is as mainstream like ""stranger danger"", where we can progressively teach them some form of elementary critical thinking as they age.

Children don't need to be taught to be scared of everyone, rather, as they grow up, they need to be taught how to identify such problematic situations, what they may experience and the options available to them. 

TL;DR:

- Child sexual abuse comes from close quarters such as family and friends.
- Children need to be taught the mainstream equivalent of ""Stranger Danger"" with respect to family and other known individuals
- A version of Grimm fairy tales with stories illustrating such predators, the tactics they might use and how to escape them would be helpful.
- Parents need to empathise with their kids and teach them to handle such events with examples and details iteratively provided as they grow up.

MAJOR EDIT:

The above statistic is actually 7.5% - 11.7% for contact-based sexual abuse for children of age 0 to 17. 

Caveat: It is mainly weighted by the 14-17 year age group and it includes abuse from peers. 

However since this post is primarily focused on addressing concerns in re infants and from family members, I'll revise the statistics based on a major study used in the meta-analysis (1) to directly reflect abuse experienced by infants. I'll also include any biases that may be inherent in them for it's not my intention to spread hysteria. I sincerely apologise for not expounding upon the aforementioned statistic.

The following statistics are gathered from one of the main studies used in the aforementioned meta-analysis (1).

Sexual abuse experienced by children:
Sorted by Age and type of abuser:

- 2-5 years old:   
By known adult: 0.6%  
By Peer: 0.3%
- 6-9 years old:  
By known adult: 0.7%  
By Peer: 2.6%
- 10-13 years old:  
By known adult: 0.9%  
By Peer:1.4%
- 14-17 years old:  
By known adult: 3.2%  
By Peer:7.7%

Caveat: These do not include sexual abuse from flashed exposure and sexual harassment.

Limitations of the study:

1. > **For children who're too young (<10 years old), their caregiver was the primary respondent**  
I believe the obvious bias inherent in this is self-explanatory.
2. >24.8% of the participants were over-sampled from places with >70% population of Black, Hispanic or low-income households.  
As many commenters pointed out, a good community significantly reduces the chance of such abuse being perpetrated.
3. >Any survey that requires finding respondents at home and obtaining cooperation
runs the risk of missing those members of the population who may be
most vulnerable to victimization
4. The study was conducted in the last decade. As some commenters pointed out, and the study agrees with them, there has been a signifcant drop in the level of sexual abuse from pre-1990 levels
5. Although the sample size of roughly 4.5K respondents is large enough, it's only a representation of the population as in any other study.

TL;DR for Major edit: 
We've made significant progress in reducing the number of such sexual abuse cases from pre-1990 levels, especially for young children albeit there are some limitations to such studies.",1
"CMV: Writing ""thanks for the gold kind stranger"" is annoying, cringy, and unnecessary.",4872,390,2019-06-01 07:45:52,"When someone gives you gold you can send them a private message to thank them personally. Editing your comment ruins the joke and I think shows that someone takes imaginary internet points too seriously. It's similar to a comedian laughing at his own jokes or thanking the audience after the joke. I'm also well aware of r/AwardSpeechEdits and r/everyfuckingthread call attention to this issue as well, so I know I'm not alone. 

Edit: similar phrases such as ""RIP Inbox"" and ""great my most upvoted comment is now about x"" are also very annoying

"CMV: If NFL players were kneeling for veterans, it would be a non-issue. It's not the kneeling that has so many upset, it's the cause.",4840,1191,2018-05-25 02:42:06,"The act of kneeling is typically viewed as a humble show of respect. People kneel in prayer, athletes kneel when a player is injured on the field, service members kneel before graves of fallen soldiers, etc. In fact, it was the later that convinced Colin Kaepernick to kneel in protest after a conversation with a veteran who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. The veteran told him that kneeling would be considered more respectful than sitting down. So why do so many consider kneeling to be offensive now? If he was kneeling during the anthem to honor fallen soldiers, it likely wouldn't be an issue. That leads me to believe it's not the act of kneeling that isn't palatable for so many... It's the cause. Change my mind. ",1
CMV: Star Wars Episode I-III has better lightsaber fights than the other two trilogies.,4796,423,2020-04-05 02:26:17,"I can excuse the original Star Wars trilogy not having the most spectacular cinematic lightsaber battles, but the last three had fights that were just a bunch of fluff.

The fight with Darth Maul was undoubtedly the best choreographed. The fight General Grievous was was very imaginative & visually stunning.

The fights in the first 3 trilogies also helped move the plot along and shape the characters for the original story.

Yoda went into exile because of his loss to the Senator. Skywalker’s loss to Obi Wan was the cause of the Darth Vader suit. Anakin killing Count was a major step to the dark side and showed the Senators influence over him. Qui Gon losing to Maul was what bolstered Obi into a master and taking his promise to train Skywalker.

So not only were they the best to watch but they were much more meaningful.",1
CMV: The paparazzi/tabloid industry should be a federal crime,4785,339,2020-08-28 22:52:03,"Ya heard me right. There are already many laws to limit it. But it does not really stop anyone from rappelling down Danny DeVito's house and catch him petting a cat (horrible analogy but still). It is time we make paparazzi illegal. First of all, it is really disruptive to one's life. Yeah I get it celebrities should be used to cameras but they deserve quiet time. This ties in to my second point which is the mental cost of celebrities. They are unable to fully enjoy some quiet time with no cameras and unwind. This also means they have to look as neutral as possible and not do anything the tabloids will jump on. This ties into my third point which is fake news. You can be petting cat but from a certain angle it looks like you are hitting the cat. The most innocent stuff can look evil and dirty from certain angles. That is the angle all paparazzi try to get to stir up drama. It just instills fake news and lowers the rep for that certain celeb for no reason. And for the people saying 'free expression' or something, its not free expression, ur just tryna get some money and drama. Also last thing. Imagine yourself right now, then look at the corner of a window, now imagine there is a camera pointing at you. You suddenly feel uncomfortable, that is what celebs have to live with",1
"CMV: The way math education is currently structured is boring, ineffective, and stifles enjoyment of the subject. Math education should be reworked to be inquiry and problem based, not rote memorization",4776,353,2020-10-03 07:27:33,"I have two main premises here

1. Modern math education at the elementary and high school level stifles everything enjoyable about math, and it does so to no end
2. An inquiry-based approach is at least equally effective, and possibly more effective. For this purpose, I'm using inquiry-based to mean that a significant portion of the learning is driven by students solving problems and exploring concepts before being instructed in those concepts.

Math, as it is taught in schools right now, barely resembles math. Everything is rote memorization, with no focus on creativity, exploration, pattern recognition, or asking insightful questions. Students are shown how to do a problem, and then repeat that problem a hundred times. You haven't learned anything there - you're repeating what someone else showed you.

So many students find school math incredibly boring, and I think it's because of this problem. Kids are naturally curious and *love* puzzles, and if you present them with something engaging and fun, they'll jump into it. A lot of the hatred of math comes from having to memorize one specific way to solve a problem. It's such a common phenomenon that there are memes about math teachers getting angry when you solve a problem with a different method.

There's the argument that ""oh we need to teach fundamentals"", but fundamentals don't take a decade to teach, and they should be integrated with puzzles and problem solving. Kids need to learn basic number sense, in the same way they need to learn the alphabet, but once they have that, they should be allowed to explore. Kids in english class aren't asked to memorize increasingly complex stories, and kids in math class shouldn't be asked to memorize increasingly complex formulae.

I'm currently a math major in university, and one of the first courses I took was titled ""Intro to algebra"". The second half of the course was number theory, but a great deal of the learning was from assignments. Assignment questions were almost always framed as ""do this computation. Do you notice a pattern? Can you prove it? Can you generalize it? Do you have any conjectures?""

There's no single right answer there, and that makes it interesting! You get to be creative, you get to explore, you get to have fun!! The questions were about a whole lot of number theory questions, and I know more number theory now than if someone had just sat at a blackboard and presented theorems and proofs. Everyone in that class learned by doing and exploring and conjecturing.

96% of people who reviewed the class enjoyed it ([https://uwflow.com/course/math145](https://uwflow.com/course/math145)).

Most students don't use the facts they learn in high school. They do, however, use the soft skills. There are millions of adults who can recite the quadratic formula, to absolutely no avail.  If these people instead learned general logical thinking and creative problem solving, it would be far better for them.

Progress in an inquiry based system is slower, but it helps you develop stronger mathematical maturity so you can pick up new concepts for other subjects - say calculus for engineering or physics - more quickly. Students develop more valuable soft skills, have way more fun, and get a better picture of what math is actually like. As such, I believe that inquiry based learning is superior. CMV!

"CMV: Manspreading is a biological necessity, not toxic masculinity.",4768,1249,2019-11-07 02:58:11,"Just listened to some female behaviour expert on the radio berating men for not keeping their knees together and now I am pissed enough to make this post. 

First, an intro to balls. Why do they exist in their current shape? Commonly known as men's greatest weakness they are much more exposed to blunt force trauma than any other organ. The female primary reproductive organs are far better protected.

So, why are balls so exposed? Because sperm are heat sensitive. Human body temperature is around 37°C, balls try to maintain a temperature of 35°C. That's why they are saggy in warm environments and firm in cold.

The body's reaction to excess heat is sweating, to cool via vaporisation. But society demands that men wear pants, so the convection is strongly limited and sweating is not efficient at all, especially with legs forced together.

The lack of exposed surface to dispose of heat and moisture leads to sweaty balls and probably a reduced sperm count. Burying your balls in hot sand used to be an ancient technique of birth control.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat-based_contraception

The sperm count in Western society is low enough as it is.

Furthermore, sweaty balls are iky. 

https://mobile.twitter.com/menshumor/status/553612199055216642

So, for the sake of the continuation of the human species Manspreading should be accepted in the same way that pregnancy related hormonal craziness is accepted. I do acknowledge that a wide stance can be interpreted as an intimidation tactic, but all I care about is to avoid a swamp in my pants.",1
CMV: other cultures eating dog meat shouldn’t bother us so much since we eat the meat of animals that are significant in other cultures.,4767,717,2019-06-10 00:37:20,"Recently read that Simon Crowell donated over $30k to a charity which then bought about 200 dogs from a dog meat farm in Korea. The article was from People, so I’m sure all the facts are there /s. Regardless of the source, I’ve started to be bothered lately when people freak out about the barbarism of other cultures eating animals that western cultures consider pets and companions. I’m a lifelong dog lover and have owned one myself, and I used to also be abhorred by the idea that anyone would ever eat one. I’m coming to realize it’s a way more complicated issue than just “dogs are good, only savages would eat them!!” It’s a cultural difference in animal meat choice. In India, Hindus hold cows as respected motherly figures and even family members and would never consider eating them or any beef at all. Western cultures eat beef anyway. What’s the difference between our practice and the practice of cultures who don’t have a problem eating dog meat? I would never eat it, and I’m bothered when I hear about dog meat farms or see pictures of dogs in cages awaiting slaughter, but I don’t want to think about cow meat farms or any other animal awaiting slaughter either. I feel like I don’t know enough about this issue and want to see if I can change my view to understand why someone would donate so much money just to buy dogs from Korea to have them sent to other countries which almost definitely have dog overpopulation problems anyway. I feel like I will not have a good time if I tell more people about this opinion, so I’m kind of hoping to be able to change it, or at least be given enough information to be able to defend my view better to other people who disagree with it.",1
CMV: It should be the standard in offices to allow for a 20 minute nap around noon,4754,557,2020-04-20 21:41:11,"A 20 Minute nap, after a few days of getting into the habit of it, is found to be the perfect amount of time to get the most energizing light sleep without transitioning into heavy sleep, causing drowsiness upon wake. We all know that productivity, energy, and morale dwindle in the afternoon, which, sure, wouldn't happen if everyone got the full 8 Hours of sleep at night, but let's be honest, who does that? 

There's really not much of a downside that I can see, because the increase in productivity more than makes up for the lost 20 minutes.

In fact, a 20 minute nap at noon actually decreases the amount of sleep needed at night to be healthy from 8 Hours to 6 Hours, giving more time at home as well.",1

CMV: The minimum wage should be directly attached to housing costs with low consideration of other factors.,4663,1087,2018-10-21 22:35:13,"Minimum wage is intended to be the lowest wage one can exist on without going into debt trying to buy groceries and toilet paper at the same time. The United States is way too big and way too varied in economic structure for a flat national minimum to make sense, so $15 nationally will not work. However, we can't trust the local corporate and legal structures to come up with wage laws that make sense for their area without some national guidelines.

If you break down the cost of living, the biggest necessary expense for a single adult is going to be housing, usually by a VERY wide margin. Landlords have a financial incentive to make this cost go up as much and as often as possible (duh) and no incentive to make housing affordable and accessible, because it's a necessity that's extremely hard to go without. You \*need\* housing in order to not die of exposure. This makes it easy for landlords and property managers to behave in predatory ways toward their tenants, for example raising the cost of housing on lease renewal by exactly the margin that the company their tenant works for has increased their pay. The landlord, doing no additional labor, is now getting that worker's raise.

It's commonly agreed that 40 hours is a standard work week. Using that number as our base, but acknowledging that most companies paying minimum wage are not interested in giving their workers the opportunity to approach overtime, I think it's reasonable to say that the average part time worker can be expected to get around 20 hours.

I believe that the minimum wage should be equivalent to the after tax, take-home pay that is needed to pay rent for safe single-person suitable housing within reasonable transit distance from the job, and that this amount of money should be earned in under 60 hours per month (15/week). This ensures that:

1. Local business will pressure landlords to keep housing near their businesses affordable, so
2. The cost of housing will trend toward slightly above the cost of maintaining that housing, which deincentivizes profiting off of owning something you aren't using, making the cost of purchasing a home and settling in early adulthood well within the realm of possibility for your average family
3. The minimum wage is scaled according to the most expensive regional thing you HAVE to pay for, and
4. Anyone who holds any job will be able to afford safe shelter for at least long enough to find a better job or get some education, which will increase stability and reduce the homeless population using the market instead of using public services as band aids

I do acknowledge that there are some issues inherent in this, for example walmart purchasing a building and turning it into $12.50/month studio apartments in order to retain a low labor value in the area or the implications in how this impacts military pay, but the idea here is to specifically plan for regional nuance, so doing this would also involve preventing large corporate entities from buying apartment buildings.

I've believed this for a long while but I also do not feel that I know enough about politics or economics to have a reliable understanding of many facets of the situation, and I look forward to discussing it so I can adjust this view accordingly

edit:

if you start a conversation I've had 12 times already I'm just ignoring the message, sorry.

and someone asked for specific examples of what rent prices would result in what wages, so

if a standard, expected price for a two bedroom apartment is $1200, pay should be around $10 (net pay, so probably closer to $12 gross) because accommodation for one person costs $600 a month, which can be earned in 60 hours at that rate.

also, I'm going to bed soon, have work in the morning.

CMV: Society has Moved Away From “Doing Good” as a way to Convey Morality to “Condemning bad”.,4656,138,2018-12-06 22:24:03,"I apologize if the title is a bit confusing.  I think in our current society (in the US at least) we have fallen into a pattern of becoming hyper focused on the bad things that people do, and then use this outrage as a basis for which to feel good about ourselves. While condemning the bad things people do isn’t necessarily a negative on its own, it seems to have become an insidious force in our culture.  People are beginning to substitute doing actual good things like helping, bring kind, and generosity with a false sense of moral superiority because they can rationalize complacency with “well at least I’m not ____ (a nazi/racist/bigoted or whatever).

I want people to understand that what I’m talking about isn’t an attack on “virtue signaling” or any other political style rhetoric (although the current political situation has increased the frequency of people doing this). It’s more of a commentary on a wider societal problem that is extremely detrimental to people overall.  Perhaps one of the places this is most prevalent is actually on Reddit itself.  The front page is always filled with posts from subs like: r/maliciouscomploance, r/pettyrevenge, r/talesfrom___, r/idontworkherelady, all which tell stories of Redditors “getting back” at people who did bad things, and everyone kind of jerks themselves off to how self righteous they are.  

I first started noticing this problem around 2012 and it continues to get worse every year.  It seems like people have moved away from doing things that are cool, pure, and awesome in a way that brings people together, and instead seem to be content to bask in a holier than thou attitude because they aren’t a member of the KKK.

Can anyone change this view for me?  I need my faith in humanity to be restored.

"CMV: The Amazon rainforest is too integral to the health of the planet for one nation to be guardian. The Amazon should be entrusted to a global guardianship, a combo of high level forest management, and military protection to ensure its persistence and health.",4632,654,2020-01-24 20:10:28,"Edit to add: I 'misspoke' earlier when writing the subject line. Here is how it should read:

# CMV: The Amazon rainforest is too  integral to the health of the planet for individual nations to be guardian. The  Amazon should be entrusted to a global guardianship, a combo of high  level forest management, and military protection to ensure its  persistence and health.

I think it is well established that the Amazon rainforest is integral to the health of the planet, as a carbon graveyard and heat sink; home to stunning biodiversity and cultural heritage; its loss would have unimaginably harmful global impacts.

Its survival is our survival, and a multinational coalition should step up to protect it and take guardianship, hopefully with cooperation of government (the idea being the execution of economic sanctions and threat of military force from several powerful nations would sway even someone like Bolsinaro to cave). I think this works best spearheaded by the US, but would need purchase from several other major military and economic powers.

EDIT to add: I want to clarify that I am generally 100% anti-war and/or military intervention. in fact, part of the reason i am putting this up for discussion is that i am not fully sure about it, and i do not like that, as far as i can see, this might be a rare situation where military force might be required. i am also anti-colonial, anti-racists, and pro-democracy.

Response: Thanks to everyone who contributed, PatrickKelly2012 had the biggest impact on my thinking. seems that the Amazon is not as integral as I thought. I still think it is worth preserving at all costs, but see how military intervention would counter-productive. my hope is that an international movement coalesces to and uses all non-violent means to protect all of the earth's biosphere, especially the ocean and the oldest forests.

"CMV: Fines should be based on the percentage of the offenders total wealth, not a set amount of money.",4595,628,2019-07-28 09:14:07,"Several countries including Switzerland already do this. 

Fines are meant to be a punishment/deterrent that isn’t quite as harsh as prison time. That said, there are rich fucks here in North America that couldn’t care less about their drunken spoiled kid’s behaviour (or their own) because the fines are so insignificant. 

On top of that, many rich people from Europe and other parts of the world aren’t even aware of the stigma of paying a fine; they literally see it as “it costs $30 to litter”, “it costs $200 to go over the speed limit”, etc. (They’re technically right, but the fact that they view it that way should be a red flag that using a set amount of money as a deterrent doesn’t work on some people.)

Law-breaking is universal. Yet the effect of a trust-fund billionaire paying a $200 fine vs someone with only $500 of savings being charged with the same is vastly different. But it’s far more equal when the punishment for a small offence for both of these fellows is having to pay 5% of their total net worth. 

(5% is a number I pulled out of my ass. As long as it’s an equal percentage for everyone and not a draconian enough percentage to make jail time preferable, lawmakers could agree on a reasonable amount. **As long as it’s equal for everyone**.)

A side note I remembered when writing this: For corporations and politicians, the fines should be even more damaging. 

They get hit with fines that aren’t even based on how much they profited from the illegal activity. Like the degenerate, piece-of-shit family the Sacklers, who own the company (Purdue Pharma) that debatably started the American opioid crisis, and Canada’s by extension. 
These people conducted the NFL/Big tobacco-style propaganda campaign of “our product isn’t that bad”, paying off corrupt doctors and spokespeople to downplay how addictive opioids are, and years later when it was too late, Purdue Pharma was fined $600 million.

What a whopper, right? By this time, Purdue Pharma had raked in $31 Billion dollars. That fine was a drop in the bucket. Their bank accounts should have been *gutted* for what they did. This wasn’t a deterrent to other predatory corporate titans from trying something like this. If anything, it was a public demonstration that anything is allowed as long as your illegal activities make more profit than the expense of paying the fine. Have at it: the fine is nothing more than an expense you have to factor into your business plan. 

Back to what I said about the fines for individuals “not a draconian enough percentage to make jail time preferable”: I stand by this, but it should be the opposite for major political and corporate fines. If you’re going to abuse that amount of power, the fines should be based on:

100% of the money you made from the illegal activities + ~90% of your remaining net worth, after that fine. 

You can count the first and second section as separate: change my view!

Edit 1) a lot of people ask what would become of someone in debt or with no money. We would pay them (Just kidding). The solution to this is basing the fine on a percentage of net worth, but introducing a baseline amount that the fine cannot go any lower than. We could keep the cost  of the fines now as the level that the fines cannot go any lower than.

Edit 2) “net worth” in this context is the amount of cash the offender has, plus everything they own or own part of that can be converted into cash.

Edit 3) I’m going to stop arguing for and against a broke person paying a baseline amount of money, or not. It’s great to hear different points of view from people, but the comments are torn about 50/50 between “a single mom shouldn’t have to worry about paying the next bill due to a baseline fine; if you only have $200, losing 10 is a BIG hit!” (which, I should note, is the effect of the system we have now) and “if someone has no or almost no money, the system would allow them to do whatever they wanted and they would be free of consequences!” (Which is a good argument for a baseline amount of money the fine costs). I’ve heard both sides, I won’t be fully siding with either. 

Edit 4) No, this does not punish people for being frugal and smart with their money. If you and your neighbour both have to pay a ticket, you have $100,000 that you have in your car, your house and your kids college -and you have some cash leftover- and your irresponsible neighbour “blew $100,000 on a stupid boat”, and has no cash, you will still be fined equally. 
The boat would not be accounted for as a boat: it would be considered $100,000 in the form of a boat. 

Refer to edit 2): “net worth” in this context is the amount of cash the offender has, plus everything they own or own part of that can be converted into cash.

You guessed it: if your ‘financially irresponsible’ neighbour has to sell his boat to pay the fine, and have the extra cash left over, that’s his problem. Not yours.

Alright, I’ll edit edit 4 to include this; a lot of people are asking. 

I used the boat as an example precisely *because* it’s something that retains value. If your neighbour spent all his money on things that **don’t** retain value, like food, vacations and hookers —Things that are briefly consumed and are then gone— was the neighbour unwise with his money? Sure, let’s say he was. But since he spent all that money on things that didn’t retain value, that chunk of his net worth is simply gone. He is now at a lower networth than you are, and will still be fined accordingly. 

Edit 5) Jesus Christ. No, this punishment is not the same as “sentencing a 20-year old to twenty  years in jail vs 70-year old to only one year in jail for the same crime, because “they have more time left”. Nor do I think this is equivalent to raising all crimes to be punishable by death. You can’t buy more time, and I think the commenters suggesting everyone be sentenced to equal times of community service have a great point. 5h lost to a tech titan is 5h lost to a homeless person. (Whether or not they could have used this time to be productive to society is irrelevant. Just take it out of their free time, Einstein.)",1
"CMV: I Think “Toxic Femininity” Exists, and is Equally as Troublesome as Toxic Masculinity",4584,794,2018-10-31 01:46:20,"Before I start this I want to say this isn’t some Incel write up about how women are the cause of the worlds problems.  I just think it’s time that we as a species acknowledge that both sexes have flaws, and we can’t progress unless each are looked at accordingly.

To start with, a woman having a negative emotional reaction to a situation or act does not mean the act or situation is inherently flawed.  You know the old trope of “my wife is mad at me and I don’t know what I did wrong”.  Yeah, that’s because you probably didn’t do anything wrong.  This toxic behavior of perceptions over intention is just one aspect of this problem.

Also, women’s desire to be with a certain subset of men, that does not reflect qualities the majority of men can obtain.  Unchangeable attributes like height and Baldness come to mind (saying this as a 6ft 2” guy with a full head of hair).  While the desire to be with the best is not wrong, the act of discrimination based on certain qualities is.  Leaving out 50% of men hurts both men and women in their formation of long term relationships.

Now, please don’t yell at me for being sexist.  My view is that toxic femininity exists and is harmful to our society.  Tell me why I am wrong

CMV: Arrest records should not be made public; only conviction records should be,4586,289,2019-11-26 04:34:20,"I was reading my local newspaper last night and every week the police department puts out a record of arrests made in the county. We're not a large county, so it's not uncommon to know someone who is ""featured"" (or at least know someone in their family/same last name). Obviously, not *everyone* who is arrested is guilty. If they're found not guilty and the crime was minor (and most are), that won't make the paper -- but their arrest already has. And given that most newspapers are published online nowadays, their names will come up in search engines as having been arrested (but you'd have to search the state court record system to find out they weren't convicted, which is much harder to do). 

People should not be convicted in the court of public opinion before they are convicted in an actual court. It's not the public's business who gets arrested. It's the public's business who is found guilty of a crime.

CMV: 2020 will be known in history as the crucial turning point at which China became ‘the new boss’.,4568,683,2020-03-29 19:41:01,"ETA: View changed. 

Various people here have convinced me that 
1. Economically speaking, China might need the developed world more than the other way around. They are the number one manufacturer in the world, but their economy is likely not robust and/or diversified enough to adapt if/when their labor costs rise and their customers start to move manufacturing elsewhere. 
2. The CCP is probably lying about the number of infections in China even now, which, in the face of global disaster, would make them very much the opposite of the responsible world leader I thought they might be trying to position/portray themselves as. 
3. Any 'good guy' action on their part, or even the attempts at it (which frequently seem to go wrong) is likely more motivated by the need to produce propaganda for their own population, than by a genuine desire to help the rest of the world out. 

Point number 2 in particular has driven a nail through the heart of my premise. 

I apologize to the people whose long, thoughtful and detailed posts I wasn't able to respond to. Regardless of whether I responded or not, I've read everything, and I genuinely want to thank all of you for your contributions!

\*-\*-\*

What we are witnessing right now is the changing of the guard. 

Economically, China is already a power nobody else can live without. By manufacturing output, it is the world leader. Even American companies known for innovation (notably Silicon Valley giants like Apple) are lost without Chinese laborers assembling their products. But not just them. 

China has effectively colonized the most valuable parts of Africa, not with boots on the ground as Europeans once did, but with huge financial and infrastructure investments. He who pays the piper, calls the tune. 

Americans and Europeans are losing faith in the democratic model by the millions. Populist rhetoric is winning. Increasingly, strong if perhaps totalitarian leadership is seen not just as acceptable, but maybe even the only really effective option we have, even by the current US President. People, not just in the US but in various European nations as well, are refusing to even exercise their democratic right to vote because they think it’s pointless. Newer EU member states are deeply disappointed with a real or perceived failure of the EU to make any kind of positive difference in their citizens’ lives, and the more established ones are either considering going it on their own again in order to focus on their own (not necessary democratic) alternative narratives, or they are actively blocking further European integration, which would be necessary for the Union to tackle big current and future events, including but not limited to an unlikely but, in the event that it were to happen, surely devastating war with the Chinese. Russia, which at least pretended to strive for democracy for a couple of decades following the Cold War, recently passed a series of constitutional amendments aimed at enabling Putin (and whoever comes after him) to rule for life. 

And now, the final nail in the coffin: the Chinese are winning hearts and minds by sending face masks, ventilators and medical personnel all around the world. 

Xi has promised his military power will rival that of the Americans by 2035, but I don’t think it will even matter. America is not going to war with the Chinese. The economic price to pay would be too high. Not to mention, if the issue were forced, then given their superior numbers and unrivaled manufacturing capacity, the Chinese may well win that war if it started tomorrow.

I don’t particularly look forward to living in a totalitarian world order. So, change my view.",1
CMV: Children enrolled in K-12 schools should have free lunch regardless of ability to pay or qualify for free lunch program.,4569,494,2020-02-03 07:38:54,"According to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, basic needs such as shelter, and food must be obtained in order for an individual to progress higher through the pyramid. Children who are sated have a better ability to focus on their learning instead of on where their next meal is coming from. The meals provided at school might be the only meal the child knows they are getting that day. I think establishing a school as a “safe space” for children will give them a better chance for success.

Some opponents of this idea may suggest that the financial cost is simply too much of a burden for the government or the individual school district to bear, however, programs could be implemented to ensure the lowest cost. Even though the cost would never be able to be eliminated, any expense gained could be argued that the value to the student would be immeasurable in terms of the value of their life over time. Some other considerations to consider for this issue could be some of the logistics while handling children with allergies, or children who have picky tastes, you wouldn’t want to provide them with a food that they would not eat and then just throw away – however, I think this would be a small challenge to overcome and would ultimately improve children’s food security in America.",1
CMV: Colleges in the U.S. only care about profits and protecting profit generators in the middle of a pandemic,4560,134,2020-08-12 03:39:31,"Okay so, as I'm sure other sports fans have noticed, the NCAA has suspended all fall championships outside of division 1 and the Big Ten has officially opted out of the 2020 fall sports season.  Basically universities are recognizing that travel and the inevitable proximity to one another is unsafe and unpredictable.  So, to protect athletes that make them millions, they are preventing competition.  This is completely reasonable and is best practice for navigating the dangers to the health of student-athletes.  

However, they seem to take no issue with bringing in students from all across the country, and in some cases different countries, to live in highly close proximity on campus and go to massive lecture halls.  Why?  As some economists have noted, many universities without huge endowments may go bankrupt without tuition and room and board expenses being maintained by students.  So, they value their profit generators (student-athletes) and want to protect them, but health and safety is out the window if that means losing out on room and board (which would occur if the fall semester was declared online only) and tuition (many students refuse to pay the same price for an online tuition and are opting to take gap years if this is the case).   

It's certainly a financially tough situation for many schools, but should maintaining revenue truly be the driving force behind holding classes in person when big univeristies are signaling that they fully understand how unsafe travelling and being in close contact with people is at this point in the U.S.?  Further, by making this choice to have classes held in person, I believe the vast majority of universities have zero actual regard for the health and well-being of their students if it hurts their pockets.  Change my view?",1
CMV: The 40 hour work week is an outdated concept and needs to be lowered to 30.,4554,720,2019-04-10 21:48:22,"I am an hourly worker in the US, so this mainly applies to the laws here, but it can apply anywhere that has similar wage laws. The basic idea behind the 40 hour work week was great when it was adopted, and it has given us a solid foundation to build off of in regards to overtime pay. However, people seem to forget that it is an arbitrary number that is only moderately connected to how we live our lives.

The premise is that we should have 8 hours for work, 8 hours for home, and 8 hours for sleep. That, of course, doesn't take into account a lot of what goes into the wotk day. First, there's the unpaid half hour or more for lunch. Second, there's the commute that for me can average 45 minutes each way, but for some people it's even more than that. Already, that's 10 hours centered around work instead of 8, and that doesn't even take into account a lot of the unpaid work that people do off the clock like receiving calls or answering emails at home (this happens way too often and everyone is too afraid of negative consequences to refuse to be available after hours).

This is happening at the same time as people are worrying about automation and the future of the labor force. Concepts like a universal basic income are pretty radical and could be a necessity in the future, but I think they skip past a much simpler solution to keep people employed, that being shortening the work week. 

I know that France already has a 35 hour work week, but I think that it should be shortened to 30. This could mean five 6 hour days, or four 7.5 hour days, or even three 10 hour days (although I used to live in a state where anything over 8 hours was considered overtime regardless of how much you worked the rest of the week. I still like that concept but will give it up in favor of this change). Some businesses would still want workers to put in more hours than that and would pay the overtime, but others would have to hire more workers to make up the extra time. 

This would work best with a strong increase to the national minimum wage so that workers whose hours get cut wouldn't necessarily see a huge pay cut, as well as a universal health care system so that companies don't play the ""cut worker's hours to avoid paying benefits"" game. We also have to have a conversation about salaried employees and contract/self-employed work to make sure that companies don't circumvent hourly wage laws through those loopholes.

I'm sure this will be met with a ton of resistance from business owners, but we live in a society, and workers need to be able to live, and also have time to live. I'll change my mind on this if it's entirely economically unsound, or if there's a better way to go about it.

EDIT: For clarification, this would not automatically limit people to 30 hours, just that overtime would kick in at anything over 30 hours instead of 40. Also, thanks to the great discussion here I'm rethinking this a bit due to the vast differences there are in how, where, and when people work.",1
"CMV: Legislative bodies should be required to explain, in formal writing, why they voted a certain way when it comes to legislation.",4543,251,2018-11-30 07:06:52,"I think publicly elected officials responsible for driving policy and legislation should be required to explain why they vote certain ways in writing. Voting along party lines is reprehensible regardless of the side. Politics shouldn't be a game about which side wins, but rather which fact-based opinions win regardless of sides. If the legislative bodies have no reasonable explanation for why they voted a certain way besides voting along party lines, they should not be allowed to vote because we have no reason to believe that they're not voting out of self-interest. If, for example, someone in Congress voted against what seems to be reasonable gun law without explanation, but you can see in their financial disclosure that the NRA contributes a lot of money and support for them, how are we to know that their vote was not influenced by the NRA without them explicitly citing so and explaining what other reason compelled them not to vote for said reasonable legislation? I'm not even asking for a long written response from them. A short paragraph or page summary with sources they're using to base their vote on is good enough. ",1
CMV: Dragonflys are significantly doper than spiders,4539,273,2018-10-15 23:59:30,"I know reddit is fairly enamored with spiders (/r/spiderbro, etc.), but I think dragonflys are doper.

"CMV: Our Society is Replacing ""Doing Good' With ""Condemning Bad"" as to how we Gauge Morality",4516,448,2019-01-14 02:03:01,"It seems over the past 5-10 years or so that western society has replaced ""doing good"" as a way to convey moral righteousness with ""condemning bad"".  Rather than people engaging in acts of selflessness or kindness, individuals are condemning the misdeeds of others, and then using that as a basis for which to feel morally superior.  This shift is causing TONS of unintended consequences.

For example, instead of giving money to a school in a poor black neighborhood, or volunteering at a soup kitchen in an area filled with struggling minorities, people are jumping on Twitter to bash something racist a celebrity said, or signing a petition to have a someone who posted racist comments online fired from their job.  While we can all agree that racism is bad, the problem is that the vast majority of people aren't really racist.  Yet, tons of people are using ""Well least I'm not a Nazi"" as a way to feel good about how they live their lives.  Not only does this type of behavior foster a huge amount of complacency when it comes to actually taking action to do good to others, it creates a ""watchdog"" environment where everyone is hyper focused on the behavior of those around them so they can be the first to condemn wrongdoing.

While I don't really identify as some boomer neoconservative, I kind of understand what they mean when they talk about ""virtue signaling"".  It's this culture of outrage and constantly policing the behavior of others as opposed to silently helping those in need.  

To illustrate this point, one of my favorite pictures is a painting of Jesus and a Nazi guard walking together down a dirt road.  In the painting Jesus is carrying the man's pack and engaging in earnest conversation with him.  What makes this picture so powerful is it shows Jesus treating someone who we would consider the literal scum of the earth with kindness and love.  While an ordinary person might think that the most ""morally right"" action to take when meeting a Nazi is to treat them to a big old ""Fuck you"" at best, and violence at worst. True compassion and love do not discriminate based on whether or not the person deserves them, which is what makes them so powerful.   

I heard a story a few weeks ago about a gunman that had gone into an Amish community (church or school or something I can't remember) and killed and injured many people, including children.  Despite the loss of life, the Amish community issued a statement just days after the shooting saying that they had forgiven the gunman.  They weren't saying what the man had done was ""okay"", but that they had forgiven him of his horrible crime.  How starkly this story stands in contrast to the rabid calls for blood and thirst for the sort of ""justified revenge"" that our society (especially in the US) seems to crave.

This desire to constantly denounce bad behavior is the driving force for why society seems to becoming increasingly divided along lines of race, gender, political views, and religion as people (largely influenced by the sharp decline in news media and journalism) latch onto the misdeeds of specific demographics and then use it as a way to feel secure in their own mediocrity.  Because even if your moral righteousness only extends to you retweeting a snarky insult towards Trump, atleast your're not a racist/sexist/homophobe.

Even on Reddit, the front page is always covered with posts from r/maliciouscompliance, r/choosingbeggars, r/murderedbywords, r/prorevenge, and r/inceltears as people circlejerk themselves into a coma at the fact that they are better than these 1% of people who are stupid/mean/bigotted or whatever.

Can you change my view?  I feel like I'm the only one who thinks this way.

CMV - It's immoral that the wealthy can hire better lawyers.,4519,719,2019-12-02 07:21:20,"Justice should be impartial whether you are rich or poor. But wealthy companies and individuals can afford better lawyers. In practice, this means they are treated more leniently by the justice system. 

Wealthy individuals can get away with crimes more easily than others. The poor are more likely to be wrongly convicted. 

Wealthy companies can also use their better lawyers and deeper pockets to bully smaller competitors in lawsuits. 

I'm not sure what a more just solution would be. 

Maybe lawyers should be required to face off against lawyers with similar records, like seeding in sports tournaments. This would remove the comparative advantage of Mr Moneybags hiring a top lawyer against a third rate defence/ prosecutor and buying better justice.",1
"CMV: The military budget of the US is unnecessarily large, and the militaristic goals of the US can be achieved with less funding",4494,604,2017-09-20 23:14:19,"It is my view that the US can achieve their militaristic goals with a significantly reduced military budget. According to [these numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures), the amount spent by one country approaches half of the world's total military expenditures. When you consider the percentage of GDP spent on military, the US at 3.3% is fairly average in spending, but with the astronomical margin in GDP between the US and the rest of the world, US military spending is miles beyond any other country and the disparity seems unnecessary. 

Taken from their [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army) the purpose of the US Army is...

* Preserving the peace and security and providing for the defense of the United States, the Commonwealths and possessions and any areas occupied by the United States
* Supporting the national policies
* Implementing the national objectives
* Overcoming any nations responsible for aggressive acts that imperil the peace and security of the United States 

Those goals can be achieved with substantially less military funding. CMV. 

edit: My view was changed largely by the fact that the purpose of the US military is far more broad and essential to the current geopolitical landscape than I understood. Also several comments regarding past innovations of the military and a breakdown of why the US military costs more than that of other countries received deltas.

CMV: Gender Dysphoria is a mental disorder,4487,1291,2019-11-13 19:37:01,"This topic has already been discussed in this sub [once before](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/cm0jkt), but I was left severely dissatisfied with this thread. OP barely reviewed or discussed the counterclaims presented.

He/she blindly went along with whatever was being said. From analysing the thread it seems clear that OP got caught up in political correctness—""causing no offense"" and ""respecting everyone""—to the point where his/her capacity to critically analyse the refutations was diminished to the point where he/she just accepted them, no questions asked.

I respect everyone. I firmly believe that discrimination and stigma only cause harm. I don't intend to cause any offense on purpose. However, in the interest of an honest discussion, I may offend someone. That's the nature of discussing controversial topics such as gender identity and politics. You can't get around offense if you want to have a meaningful, rational discussion. With this in mind, if you're offended by my arguments—keep in mind that they don't come from a place of hatred or discrimination. I won't apologise if you're offended though. Instead of complaining or feeling put down, channel that energy into something positive and change my view! :)

With that preamble out of the way, I want to outline my view fully so as to leave no room for misinterpretation.

* 1) There are two biological sexes. ""Intersex"" is a term reserved for describing people with medical disorders such as chromosomal disorders, malformed genitalia, etc.

* 2) Gender is biologically dependent. >99% of people identify as the same gender as their biological sex. To deny that a causal relationship here is absurd. Cultural differences in masculine and feminine roles have a role to play. There's a significant overlap of interests between men and women, but it has been shown that as societies trend toward gender equality, differences in temperament and interests between genders *increase*. This suggests that gender differences between men and women are to an extent biologically dependent.

* 3) Gender is binary. An individual may exhibit traits of varying masculinity/femininity. Some men may exhibit overwhelmingly 'feminine' characteristics. There's nothing wrong with this. There's nothing wrong with identifying with these characteristics either, in the same way that there's nothing wrong with identifying as a ""banker"" if you work at a bank.

* 4) Gender Dysphoria (GD) is ""the distress a person feels due to a mismatch between their gender identity and their biological sex"".

* 5) Identity is not the same as sexual orientation (attraction). The stress homosexuals and bisexuals feel come as a result of not feeling accepted by peers and society, trans people don't feel this is enough—they desire to change their bodies to fit their 'identity'.

* 6) GD is a socially accepted delusion. A delusion is ""an idiosyncratic belief or impression maintained despite being contradicted by reality or rational argument, typically as a symptom of mental disorder."" Reality: You are a male body. Delusion: You are a female. You feel great stress and discomfort because you identify as a female ""trapped"" in a male body. This denies the reality that you are, in fact, a male body. I draw similarities here to anorexia—anorexics deny the reality that they are underweight. Their delusion is that they are overweight. Thus they feel compelled to lose weight in response to this delusion. People experiencing GD feel compelled to change their sex in response to their delusion that they are not the sex they are. Both anorexia and GD are stigmatised to some extent in society. One is socially accepted and encouraged, the other is not.

* 7) GD may or may not be able to be ""cured"". I draw no conclusions here; the evidence on both sides is scarce. On one hand, some data suggest that sex reassignment surgery alleviates symptoms of GD (the extent to which is debatable). However, some societies (countries, universities, etc.) have recently taking the position that even *considering* GD as a potential mental illness is ""hate speech"" and ""offensive"". This prevents genuine research into the nature of GD and possible treatment, in favour of 'giving in to the delusion' in the form of hormone treatment and surgery.

* 8) You can fight against discrimination and stigma while still recognising GD as a disorder, just like you can fight against discrimination and stigma while recognising bipolar, depression, schizophrenia, etc. as mental disorders/illnesses.

Nothing is wrong with exhibiting feminine traits if you’re a male, and vice versa. Nothing is wrong with dressing outside cultural norms, or identifying yourself with those behaviours and traits. But if you are discontent with the body you ARE, then you have a mental disorder.

I look forward to hearing your rebuttals!

Edit: I'm glad to see this thread is generating some real discussion, thanks everyone!

Edit 2: I've realised after some discussion that there are some points in this post which I could have defined better and clarified further. I've also had my view changed on certain points. For the sake of reference, though, I'm going to leave the post above exactly how I originally wrote it.",1
CMV: Pet ownership should be strictly regulated and licensed; a prospective owner should be required to demonstrate their ability to care for an animal before a pet license is granted and an animal is purchased or (ideally) adopted.,4473,435,2020-08-24 12:31:43,"Hi folks.

I think it's commonly acknowledged that many pet owners are not fit to properly care for their animal.

Quite aside from active abuse, there is significant passive abuse that has been normalised in western cultures, e.g.:

* Leaving co-dependent pets locked alone in small spaces for much of the day
* Providing poor quality, excessive or insufficiently varied diets
* Providing insufficient mental or physical exercise
* Raising animals in conditions that are antithetical to their natural environment (this is a little subjective, perhaps)
* Selling or giving away co-dependent pets when they no longer ""fit for purpose""

So my dangerous idea, that seems to be quite unpopular amongst everyone I've talked to, is that pet ownership should be regulated and licensed in much the same way as human adoption. It seems odd to me that we bring these animals into our lives to raise them, essentially, as our children, but we don't seem to confer on them the same living conditions as we would a child.

This view does not necessarily cover service or working animals, that's a whole different matter.

Why do I want my view changed? Two reasons:

1. I have locked horns with some of my pet-owning friends about this; their argument being that such regulations would restrict their freedom to own a thing that they want (which is precisely the point). I want to understand where they're coming from, and either they don't have the patience to articulate it in terms I can understand, or I don't have the patience to understand how they've articulated it. I'm not sure which.
2. I would really love to get a dog or cat as a companion animal, but as a city dwelling, working single person, I feel very far from being able to morally do so considering the above. If it were my job to set the terms on which a ""pet license"" is granted, my current lifestyle (and that of most city-dwelling single folks) would not pass muster. **That said, please keep in mind that my CMV appeal is about the wider issue of pet ownership, not my view that I shouldn't get a dog**.

Thanks for reading, I'll try to engage as best I can. :)",1
CMV: Religion should not be able to be used as an excuse not to vaccinate a child who is being sent to public school,4460,407,2019-01-08 05:32:05,"As a current high schooler, I have just come to the realization that many kids at my school were not fully vaccinated as children. Despite the fact that these families had no religious objection to vaccination, they were able to write it off as such, and were allowed to send their kids to public school without the required vaccinations. Essentially this loophole opens the door to any anti-vaxxer, regardless of their actual religious beliefs. Aside from this, I don’t think religion should function as a valid exemption in the first place. As far as I know, the first amendment freedom of speech is restricted when you put others in danger. For example, the first amendment does not protect shouting “fire” in a crowded, public place. Similarly, the first amendment should not protect religion when it puts others in danger. Children who can’t be vaccinated because of health complications are put at risk by unvaccinated children. Therefore, the same precedent should apply. If parents don’t want to vaccinate their children for religious reasons or not, then fine, but don’t complain when they either die or are refused from attending public school.

I think it's easy to miss because he's written to be one of the protagonists of the show, he makes us laugh, and he is, comparatively, one of the few sane/""normal"" people in the show. But lets review:

1. He nurses an obsessive crush on Pam for the first few seasons despite her being engaged to someone else. Sure, Roy is a bigger dick and ""not right"" for Pam, so we all root for him anyways, but this is textbook not cool behavior. You don't crush on someone elses SO. 
2. He pursues and invites Katy to the booze cruise and then dumps her on the cruise when she didn't really know anyone there. Like you don't have to be with her but jfc man work on your timing. Dumping someone in public while they're trapped on a boat with your coworkers is trashy. 
3. He reports Pam to HR because he's jealous she's with Roy. 
4. Jim and Pam's first (sober, at least) kiss happens after Jim tells Pam how he feels about her and Pam shoots him down, stating that they can't be together and that he misinterpreted signals. Jim has every right to be heartbroken about this, and should go his own way and leave her alone. What he actually does is follow her back into an empty office and kiss her without obtaining consent and directly disregarding that she told him she wasn't interested moments before. 
5. As a result of being shot down he literally moves branches to go mope. Think about that. ""I like a girl and she doesn't like me so I literally can't stand to be in an office with her."" That's not normal behavior. 
6. He then gets intimate with Karen despite still clearly being in love with Pam, strings her along down to Scranton then gets upset that she's living ""too close"" to him, and then dumps her in Manhattan despite being her ride and drives back to Scranton to try to get with Pam. 
7. He lies. A lot. These range from everything from little white lies about why he can't come to work to big lies like trying to cover up that Michael is dating Pam's mom. 
8. He didn't come to Pam's art show. Roy, Oscar, and Michael managed to, and Michael was the only one who was nice about it. Jim knows damn well art is a dream and a passion of Pam's and yet didn't make any time to come support a huge break in that dream. 
9. Pettily refused to get Dwight some beer and pizza after Dwight helped get Jim's kid to sleep. 
10. Bought a house ""for"" Pam without asking her. You can buy someone lunch or some jewelry without asking them. You don't make hundred-thousand+ dollar decisions without consulting your SO. 
11. Similarly, he takes the Athlead job without consulting Pam at all either even though it'll impact her majorly. Meanwhile when Pam does something big after properly consulting Jim (like going to art school) he makes a big mopey deal about it. 
12. ~~Invests $10,000 in Athlead without consulting Pam. Also Pam finds out Jim is planning to move to Philly from the frigging receiptionist at Athlead.~~ https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/fteofd/cmv_jim_halpert_from_the_office_is_an_asshole/fm9y9n0?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
13. Despite living with Pam for quite a while he only starts to act like an adult and actually clean up after himself when he's living with Darryl and because Darryl wants him to. And of course he bails on Pam and Cece during all of this, leaving her to raise their kid alone, stating that he kind of enjoys living the bachelor life again. 
14. Misses Cece's dance recital.  
15. He's generally just a snarky and sarcastic asshole. 
16. This one is a big one for me because it's one of the things people love the most about Jim: his pranks. Again, they make us laugh, so sure, they're harmless. But a good prank is supposed to make the pranked person laugh too. Jim doesn't do this. He pranks people in ways that upset them (often greatly) and does so for his amusement and the amusement of others. That's not pranking, that's bullying. And this is exacerbated by the fact that his three primary targets for pranks are Andy, Dwight, and Michael, all of whom are social oddballs and seemingly suffer from undiagnosed mental disorders. Again, this is the behavior of a bully, not a harmless prankster. 

This is a non-comprehensive list. I'm sure others could think of more.

"CMV philosophy should be a mandatory subject in public schools, taught from elementary to highschool and is equally if not more important than the other liberal arts disciplines (English, history, etc)",4446,446,2019-12-30 02:37:11,"Philosophy doesn't teach what to think, merely how to think better.  How to analyze arguments and see their merits and flaws.  It can also give everyone a baseline understanding of concepts so people with differing views can have meaningful conversations.  For example, in America, President Obama has been labeled some form of socialist/Marxist throughout his presidency by his political opponents.  I understand this is merely a scare tactic used to rile up the conservative base.  However this tactic would have been impossible if everyone had been required to have a rudimentary understanding of Karl Marx's theories.   Love him or hate him Obama was certainly no hero of the proletariat.  If a goal of public education is to produce citizens capable of critical thinking, there is no better discipline to master. 

Philosophy translates to other fields, more so than most of not all other academic disciplines.  This can allow students to find some aspect of philosophy to engage in that they will enjoy.  The notion that theories have to be falsifiable in order to be considered science is a philosophical idea (introduced by Karl Popper). Many of the ideals that America was founded on were based on the works of influential philosophers.  Freedom of religion (arguments) come from John Locke.  Freedom of speech (arguments) from John Stuart Mill.  

Most of the important questions that we as a society wrestle with are philosophical questions.  What role should government play in society, what is justice/fairness.  What laws ought we have, what values ought we hold.  Obviously having a background in philosophy won't automatically lead to agreement, but it will give us a better way to think about these issues and allow people to draw much more well reasoned conclusions.

Edit 1. I'm having a great time discussing this with everyone.  It got way more traction than I was expecting.  It's 5am for me and I gotta try to get to sleep.  I'll try to respond to everyone who leaves a comment but I won't be able to reply at all for a few hours.  Thanks everyone.

Edit 2.  I just want to clarify because I know it wasn't clear from my original post.  Elementary school is a pretty big timeline.  I think those who say 6 might be too early to try to talk about Philosophy may have a valid point.  I'm no early education expert.  That being said based on my experience as a child, I think anywhere from 10-12 would be a perfectly reasonable age to start.  Right around 4th - 5th grade. 

Edit 3. I am in no way advocating for any particular curriculum, or any particular works or philosophers be mandatory reading. Only that there should be something, people a lot smarter than me can create the actual curriculum.  And on a similar note, i am also not saying advanced concepts need to be taught from day one.  Math starts with knowing numbers, then counting, then addition/subtraction.  Then multiplication/division etc etc. The same way we don't start kids out with the quadratic formula, we don't need to start out with the most advanced philosophic arguments/concepts.

Edit 4. I regret bringing up the name of Karl Marx.  This has become a much bigger distraction to my main point than I ever intended.   For anyone new to this post, if you have specific issue with Marx, please note that I was just trying to give an example.  I'm not saying Marx should or shouldn't be taught by anyone at anytime.   Nor was I trying to make any statement about the merits of Obama's policy.  Only that based on an understanding of Marxist philosophy, Obama is not Marxist.  And anyone saying he is, shouldn't be taken seriously.",1
"CMV: Electoral reform is a more important issue than gun control, abortion, capital punishment, and BLM (US)",4433,428,2020-05-05 00:44:01,"FPTP and single member districts is why we have a two party system. FPTP has no advantages over other methods while severely restricting the choices voters can actually make. Other methods like Schulze ensure that the candidate that wins would beat any other in a head to head race. There are other things that I think should be changed like the electoral college and partisan gerrymandering but this is the only one that I think is totally noncontroversial. There is no perfect voting method, but RCV or Schulze is simply better than FPTP. 

When the constitution was made single member districts made more sense. But now, ideologies and political issues have much less to do with region. Proportional representation or a hybrid like multi member districts would allow for a much wider variety of ideologies in the government that actually represent what the electorate believes in.

Voting is the foundation of our government, if the way that we elect our candidates is broken everything else is broken. If we fixed these issues you could vote for the candidate that fits your views best without fear of wasting your vote. Electing candidates that fit our beliefs leads to a government that better supports our beliefs.

The reason why I chose the things that I did in my title is because I feel like they are very divisive issues that candidates and pundits spend a lot of time talking about, but are relatively inconsequential. 

**Ways that you can change my view:**

Show me that in places that have better voting methods things aren't different/are worse

Convince me that single member regional representation is a better system than multi-member or proportional representation

I don't think you'll change my mind about the electoral college or FPTP but you can try",1
CMV: There are regions where you should not be allowed to have large green-grass lawns,4419,285,2020-10-12 00:59:31,"In general, I find  monolithic grass lawns unaesthetic, and poor use of land, but there have been other CMV posts engaging with the labor, and aesthetic  part of it, so I want to discuss a specific, environmental component. And for disclosure, I am an environmental scientist, so educated, but also possibily biased on this topic.

I accept that many people have aesthetic or practical reasons for wanting grass lawns, and there will always be a component of personal control over their land. And that there are regions where it can be minimally impactful. 

But when I fly over Arizona for example and see vast expanses of green lawns in the middle of the dessert (and don't get me started on golf courses), I can't help but think that its a selfish travesty.  In a region with severe water scarcity issues only getting worse, to think that people decide to put in large lawns of plants that would never thrive there naturally. Because fundamentally these are decisions  that impact everyone in a community, not just you, from [https://new.azwater.gov](https://new.azwater.gov)

""The largest use of potable water in Arizona is for landscaping and as much as 70 percent of residential water use is outdoors. "" 

And in addition to the water use,benefits there is of course the damage done to delicate desert ecosystems which are among the slowest to recover. I frankly just don't see how the possible benifts of having a lawn (recreation, aesthetics, etc ) outweigh these negatives. I know there are some initiatives in AZ to encourage people to take out grass and put in turf/native plants ([https://www.glendaleaz.com/live/city\_services/water\_services/water\_conservation\_and\_sustainable\_living/landscape\_rebate](https://www.glendaleaz.com/live/city_services/water_services/water_conservation_and_sustainable_living/landscape_rebate)). But I don't think that goes far enough. I think if you really want a lawn to layout on, or whatever you should be allowed to have something like a 25'x25' patch, and that's it. Maybe if you really want more you can pay a heavy tax or a much higher water rate for lawn needs that goes to water management/conservation but I know those policies can be difficult in practice. And to those who will accuse gov overreach, I don't see a significant difference between this and other building codes designed to protect natural resources, like having to get permission to cut down certain trees, or not being allowed to destroy wetlands on your property.

Or for another example, I personally live in a coastal, storm-prone area. And native plants are a very important part of buffering storm surges. So I think I am understandably angry when I see waterfront properties with coastal veg removed and big lawns in their place. This quite directly impacts the security of my home. And then of course the indirect impacats. like all the fertilzer needed to grow a big lawn on sandy ground unsuited to which in turn goes into the bay and leads to algaeo blooms and fish kills from excess nitrogen loading. This is an instance where I strongly belive that if you decide that you want to have waterfront property that you take on the resposibility for stewarding that vital interface, and should not be allowed to replace it with a lawn. And for properties that are already lawns I think they should have to pay an addittional fee for coastal management, but should also be able to recieve susidies for converting to more sustainable sollutions. And if you decide that a big lawn is that central to your well being and identity, live somewhere else where a lawn makes sense! Same way you dont move to Southern Florida and get mad when you cant have a basement.

I can think of plenty of other examples from Southern California, to South Africa, where lawn watering is a signifcant uneccesay use in drought prone areas. As you can probably tell I feel strongly about this, but I'm always looking to get other perspectives, to help find compromises.",1
CMV: Maternity and Paternity leave should both be mandatory and equal in all aspects,4410,633,2020-02-23 05:02:05,"CMV:

&#x200B;

I know from several people i know that they actively (though secretly) discriminate against women aged around 25-35 when it comes to hiring new job applicants. The reason (at least the stated reason) being that they worry they will become pregnant and take months of paid maternity leave, so will, all things being equal, prefer to hire a man or a woman of a different age, to avoid that possibility. The thing is...this seems perfectly reasonable, most women will have a kid somewhere in that age bracket and they will take time off from work- and rightly so, we *should* be supporting women and by extension the next generation, to have a healthy and happy childhood.

The thing is that it seems to me that if the same onus fell on men and they were required to take time off work for children of which they are the legal parent, then workplaces would have one fewer (and presumably a very significant one) reason to discriminate against women in the hiring process.",1
"CMV: Obi Wan Kenobi might not have been the strongest or most powerful Jedi, but he was the Jedi MVP",4403,186,2020-06-13 00:17:43,"Almost everything Obi Wan did, he did right. The only mistake he really made was not seeing what was happening to Anakin earlier and failing to stop it. Other than that, he's accomplished more than any other Jedi. He defeated the first sith seen in a thousand years after it killed his master. He trained two of the most powerful jedis of all time. He dedicated the rest of his life after order 66 to protecting Luke Skywalker. He defeated general grevious when no one else could. He found he clone army. He defeated and maimed Anakin so badly in their duel that he was way less powerful and was not able to reach his full potential. In addition to all of this, he is one of the few Jedi shown to truly embody the Jedi code. He never let his feelings cloud his judgement (unless you count sparing Anakin, but it can be argued this was the Jedi way). The only jedis who come close to beating obi wan for MVP are Yoda and Mace Windu. However, neither of their accomplishments overshadow Obi Wans. Obi wan truly is the Jedi MVP.",1
CMV: It's oxymoronic to fly both the confederate and union flags.,4398,641,2020-04-21 19:59:33,"Despite this post being partially about the confederate flag, it isn't about whether or not it's a hate symbol. This sub is for changing views and my stance on that topic is pretty staunch. Anyway, I've seen many Americans flying the stars and stripes. On their trucks or houses or whatever. That's fine, nothing wrong with that. I personally find it a bit odd to fly your country's flag while you're _inside_ that country but whatever, you do you. What strikes me as queer to the point of bizarre is when they (usually southerners) also fly the confederate flag. Sometimes on the same vehicle. Weren't the CSA and USA at war? Weren't they enemies? Didn't one, in a manner of speaking, conquer the other? Why would you fly the flag representing your states _and_ the flag of the coalition that beat them at war?

Anyway, this being a trivial matter, I'm very much open to information.

CMV: Climate change should be the the focus in upcoming elections.,4394,482,2018-10-10 02:24:37,"As we move into a new round of important elections, at least in the US, politicians should put their plans for combating climate change front and center, and deeply criticizes those who deny it. As nations and individuals we really need to act quickly in order to limit the damage. I know saying ""should"" can be the wrong word to use but I believe it would would show the candidate to be corrupt or ignorant if they don't address the issue. 

There are many issues that face us as a society, but climate change is the one most likely to threaten our core way of life if nothing is done. I don't think there is any other issue that should trump that of climate change in terms of immediate importance. It is on the same level as the threat of global nuclear war, which rightfully received this kind of attention during the cold war when it was especially likely.

CMV: The Shape of Water is an extremely overrated movie and should have never won the Oscar for Best Picture,4371,428,2018-10-05 21:47:17,"I recently rewatched The Shape of Water and I am not a movie critique nor expert, but the realization dawned on me that it is an exquisitely bland movie that lacks an absurd amount of substance. The Shape of Water plays on to the basic beauty and the beast trope, but it does not go any further than that. The movie weighs heavily on the cinematography and strays away from any actual plot or substance. It is an intermediate form of movie writing and does not deserve any more than a Redbox rental. The movie barely dives into the actual underlying foundation for why anything happens, there is no room for individual thought and it is pressed into the viewer’s brain that there is only one way to think and that is with the protagonist. According to Vox, ""It’s a beautifully shot movie with a story that follows the traditional arcs of a fairy tale romance."" I believe that it is exactly why it should not have won, it has been done before. Compared to other past winners, such as Moonlight, which was original and intriguing.

There is no relevance to the Shape of Water, no bigger picture. A mute woman falls in love with a sea creature who likes eggs. If that’s the precedent for winning an Oscar, then The Leprechaun would have been a phenomenal candidate. The movie is visually outstanding, but so is The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and it is an incredibly lifeless movie starring Brad Pitt! Without the visuals the movie would merely be a pathetic case for an “original” plot. Quite honestly, coming from Guillermo del Toro I would not expect much, all of his movies rely on visuals such as Crimson Peak or The Hobbit. These movies appeal to the eye and the only Oscar that this movie truly deserved was Best Visuals.

Overall, the movie is basic with jaw dropping visuals. The movie won four Oscars, so it is obviously well received and I’d like to understand what is so special about its standard format. Change my view!!",1
"CMV: Parents who refuse vaccination of their children must sign a form of accountability so if their child dies from medical complications that would have been avoided by a larger than 90% consensus of global medical research, they can be charged with the appropriate crime(s) for their negligence.",4361,448,2018-11-29 07:02:53,"From my understanding (which isn't vast on this particular subject as I am not personally a parent) a child can begin their doctor/patient confidentiality between 14-16 depending on the state. The lifelong medical complications that arise from unvaccinated children generally have begun by this time, and that makes me believe that the accountability of the parent up to that point should be addressed and issued. 

Vaccinations are a family choice as there are no laws (that I'm aware of) requiring them, but the risk that the defenseless child and for that matter the public surrounding these unvaccinated children are put to should have some legal recourse to the parents or guardians if there is a fatal or detrimental illness that could have been avoided as a result of their decision to not vaccinate. I believe that it is fair for the consensus of medical professionals and their research to be a legitimate basis for a contract that holds parents accountable for their decision to disregard all of this if their child  is harmed irreparably. This contract would allow local or state law enforcement agencies and child protective services to issue charges on the parents if they deemed necessary in the case of the parents negligence in addition to opening the possibility of the child to sue the parents for their negligence in the future if they decide to (assuming they survive) as well. 

Other forms of child abuse are prosecuted, this issue should be the same. I agree that not vaccinating should be a choice, but there should be accountability and I'm not aware of any. A parent refusing vaccinating their child and this results in them dying of an otherwise preventable illness by consensus research is the same as drowning them in a bath tub. I realize that last sentence is controversial and assume it to be taken out of context, but think of this. Very rarely do unvaccinated children die immediately from the illnesses they acquire as a result of being unvaccinated, giving plenty of time for professionals to be recommending and diagnosing that the illness can be treated, but the parent refuses. They are refusing to do the thing that treats or cures their child's illness despite all evidence to the fact. Their ignorance or paranoia is no excuse to not deem this child abuse at the least and murder at the most. People get their children taken away for so many reasons in countries that turn a blind eye to holding accountability for preventable deaths. 

I am willing to accept that I may be missing some large angles here, but I don't know what they are. I hope that I explained myself well, but it's hard to fully express anything without a discussion. I welcome anyone with a contrary or parallel point of view. ",1
"CMV: Conservatives who claim to promote individual liberty over government restrictions, engage in hypocrisy when they ask the government to restrict the liberties of others: gay marriage, abortion, drug use, polygamy, euthanasia, etc.",4363,1556,2018-08-27 00:32:08,"If you claim to advocate for individual freedom, common sense would dictate that people might exercise their freedom in ways you might not approve of. 

Aside from a few protections for minors who are not expected to legally self-govern, prohibiting freedoms to only those you personally approve of is not advocating freedom, it's advocating your personal preferences. 

Furthermore, your individual rights should end where my nose begins.

I see a huge difference between the two, and I've never had anyone provide me with a substantive understanding of what I see as a blatant double standard.

Edit: WOW this blew up fast. I cannot thank everyone for the (mostly) civil discourse I’ve witnessed, and for the openness of discussion. I will have reading material for weeks, and I will try to respond in kind to everyone.

Additional edit: For those taking my argument to an extreme to justify murder or theft, you misunderstand.  If the government imposed restrictions to protect property or public safety in general from the consequences of someone’s choices, that seems sensible. But to ask the government to restrict the most personal choices available simply because you don’t agree with it... that is antithetical to the conservative ideal of “more freedom through less government”.

ABORTION: ok people, if you are going to comment on this discussion, please don’t cherry pick only one of the five topics available and pretend that a 20% contribution is anything other than white noise.

"CMV: We should be able to fire and even arrest politicians midterm, if they are caught telling blatant lies or acting against public interests. Losing votes in the next elections is not enough. Election promises should be binding.",4350,140,2017-05-04 15:53:31,"Politics and politicians are really important. They decide what happens to our country and to the people in it. They change the laws that affect us all. 

So, it is mind-boggling how easily they can get away with it, if they misuse their position to benefit select few of their friends, or lie to get the position and then do something else entirely for the next years. 

The laws about incarcerating politicians vary by their country, but in many cases it seems like you need either treason or stealing money directly into your own pocket before you face any judiciary consequences. If they have other politician friends, it seems to be downright impossible, even if rest of the country and its citizens are on the streets protesting. 

I think it should be much easier to fire politicians midterm if they are caught misusing their position or they are caught from blatant lies and are doing opposite of what they say they do. 

With great power should come great responsibility. Not being re-elected is not punishment enough for acting against public interest or lying about your intentions to the people who vote you to the office. 

I've met politicians who've openly said that they wanna be single-term politicians and don't care about not being re-elected. Then they continue to work for laws that make corruption easier, or evading taxes a breeze, or harm many of the common people to benefit a few of their CEO friends, like selling public institutions to private enterprises, for seemingly no benefit except to privatize for privatization's sake. People hate it, they don't care. They'll retire in a few years from public and are hugely rewarded by their friends. 

The laws to arrest or incarcerate politicians are difficult to execute. Who makes the laws about arresting politicians? Politicians. Who decides how much corruption is too much corruption? Politicians. Who decides how much politicians get paid? Politicians. 

Many of these get their position by lying to the public. When elections come, they all promise this and that to everyone, even if their promises contradict one another. When they get to power, they can just say, well, I couldn't do it, that's that. And okay, if that really is the case. But promises one makes should be binding. You have to provide sufficient evidence to the public that you tried to the best of your abilities to pursue these goals. 

I am not saying all politicians are bad, but many are. If you are caught lying again and again, giving statements that are false again and again, you should be punished. Maybe first a public warning, then maybe expelling the politician for a short amount of time, and then firing him from the public office for the rest of the term. He can try again in the next elections. 

Some might say that these actions might deter even honest people from going into politics. Maybe so, but I think proper laws against politicians who use their position wrongly, or get there by lying to the public and giving false promises, and truly implementing these laws would be overall beneficiary to any country. 

EDIT: Thanks guys for your input. Made me consider my position. Too many replies to answer each one, but thank you.

"CMV - All jobs should be required to state the exact salary for a given role UP FRONT, next to the other crucial details of the job.",4349,378,2019-08-16 20:34:31,"I'm sick of seeing job advertisements that simply detail the salary as ""competitive""...and that's it. As soon as you start the process of applying, there's literally no mention of the salary; they want me to sell myself to them and talk about why I'm passionate without addressing the main reason why I'm getting a job, which is to earn some damned money.

In fact, I'd say that the salary is the number one most important thing I care about in a job and thus I expect to be told it at the same time (if not before) all the other details of employment.

Also, this would really crack down on gender pay gaps - you can't exactly pay people differently depending on ethnicity or gender if the wage is stated on the advertisement.

It all just seems a bit backwards to me. I get there's the potential issue of people wanting to keep their salary private, but that seems like a small price to pay (no pun intended) for full pay equality, and companies not scamming me into employment with their ""competitive salary""; how about you tell me what the salary is and I'll decide for myself if it's fuckin competitive.

Edits: Thanks to all of you who raised very valid points, and sorry to those who I didn't get around to replying to - I spent two hours yesterday replying to posts and I had more notifications at the end of the two hours than at the start so I ultimately gave up. I hope that for the ones I did reply to, I offered some constructive counter arguements to people's points and conceded good arguements where they arose, and ultimately provided a half decent debate for you all!

I still believe that *overall*, there should be more transparency to what wages are in advance but I'll consider my view has changed to respect the following:

- If the salary is posted as a flat figure, employees lose the right to negotiate it and employers lose the right to offer more attractive (due to skill, experience etc.) employees more money to entice then in. This could be remedied by using a ""starting from..."" figure, that could be increased if applicants showed a higher than necessary level of aptitude for a role - although someone did point out this removes the ability for an employer to offer an underqualified candidate *less* money if they wanted to take that chance.

- a lot of you raised the point that while it would be convenient for employees to know the salary in advance, it wouldn't benefit the employer to have to post such a thing, therefore this would be a bit of a crap law to pass. I didn't reply to the majority of these because it was past the 2 hour mark when I had given up, but it's a solid point that I would have to concede.

- It is not detrimental to ask an employer for their salary range so you would never really have to apply to a job without knowing the salary. I thought that by asking this you would make it seem like you are only interested in the money (something that is of course true in a lot of places but employers don't like to hear), but I was wrong about that.

- the last interesting point was raised by someone in the comments and that was essentially that instead of advertising the salary range in the job listings, all employees should be required to disclose the salary's of their employees (probably in an anonymous way) so applicants know they are getting a fair wage, and employees also know they aren't being discriminated against. I think this was the best point anyone raised and if I was going to CMV to anything, it would be this. Congrats, u/DefunctWalrus",1
"CMV: Legalize all drugs. Yes, even that one.",4335,659,2020-06-25 00:46:37,"The war on drugs, from the beginning, has been a massive unconstitutional assault on the rights of Americans. It has not worked. It has never worked. It has led to the rise of gangs. It must be ended immediately, and incarcerated prisoners in jail for nonviolent drug offenses should be released and have their records expunged. And after this is done, we need to fully legalize all drugs.

* Prohibiting drugs has led to the rise in gang violence. Before criminalization, if a drugstore was selling methamphetamines and was robbed, they could simply call the police and report stolen property. But after criminalization, someone who sold methamphetamines or other drugs could not call the police to defend their property because what they are doing is illegal. So the dealer would have to defend his property with weapons. And friends. And friends with weapons.

* Legalizing drugs would rid society of drug gangs. In modern society you will find one of everything. Everything... except for violent alcohol gangs. Again, I am working off the model of prohibition. Day one after prohibition ended, alcohol gangs disappeared because they could no longer sustain themselves after being undercut by *legal legitimate businesses* selling the same stuff they were but *safer*. I see no reason this shouldn’t apply to drugs. We would not have to worry about drug importation from the southern border anymore either.

* The war on drugs is extremely unconstitutional and illegal for multiple reasons. First of it imposes the ideals of Puritanism and abstinence-only morality on American society which violates the establishment clause. Who’s to say the belief that all mind altering molecules are a divine gift from some god for human kind to cultivate harvest refine synthesize and consume at our discretion for whatever recreational spiritual or medicinal purposes we deem appropriate is any less valid than someone’s belief in Christianity? Second, it is written in history that, if the federal government wants to ban a substance, they need a constitutional amendment to do so (18th amendment). There are no constitutional amendments banning drugs meaning the federal government is overstepping it’s constitutional bounds. Next, the biggest constitutional violation is the violation of the 4th amendment rights to bodily autonomy and privacy also supported by the due process clause of the 14th amendment which ultimately decided roe v wade amended by Casey. And I’m not done yet! You have legislation such as mandatory minimum sentences and the crack cocaine disparity act which clearly violate our eighth amendment rights against cruel and unusual punishments so that poor marginalized people get their lives ruined and spend decades in prison for selling drugs to consenting adults but Jeffery Epstein rapes hundreds of childeren and serves 14 months with 72 hours weekly work release and then a free pass to violate parole?

The idea of legalizing drugs leaves some with a bad taste in their mouth. But I leave you with this question: If heroin was legal, would you do it? Would you go to Walgreens, buy the expensive powder and a syringe and a lighter? Would you put it in a spoon, hold the lighter under the spoon until it melts, fill up the syringe with the molten tonic, stick it in your arm and push it in? Just because it’s legal? My guess is no, because you understand like I do that heroin is bad for you and not worth it. I suppose in the end, America would have to make a decision: do we despise victimless drug use or gang violence more? I believe gang violence is the worst offense.

"CMV: Ken Jennings' ""Hoe"" answer should have been correct.",4333,264,2020-01-10 03:12:18,"Was reading some stuff about the Jeopardy GOAT tournament they're doing, and people brought up a [Jeopardy-famous moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpKOm-LLRhA) from Ken Jennings' original run.

CMV: Transgender people should disclose they are transgender before engaging in physically intimate acts with another person.,4323,3021,2017-09-13 05:57:21,"I'm really struggling with this.  

So, to me it just seems wrong to not tell the person your actual sex before engaging in intimacy.  If I identify as a straight man, and you present yourself as a straight woman, but you were born a man, it seems very deceitful to not tell me that before we make out or have sex.  You are not respecting my sexual preferences and, more or less, ""tricking"" me into having sex with a biological male.  

But I'm having a lot of trouble analogizing this.  If I'm exclusively attracted to redheads, and I have sex with you because you have red hair, but I later find out you colored your hair and are actually brunette, that doesn't seem like a big deal.  I don't think you should be required to tell me you died your hair before we make out.  

If I'm attracted only to beautiful people and I find out you were ugly and had plastic surgery to make yourself beautiful, that doesn't seem like a big deal either.

But the transgender thing just feels different to me and I'm having trouble articulating exactly why.  Obviously, if the point of the sex is procreation it becomes a big deal, but if it's just for fun, how is it any different from not disclosing died hair or plastic surgery?  

I think it would be wrong not to disclose a sex change operation.  I think there is something fundamental about being gay/bi/straight and you are being deceitful by not disclosing your actual sex.

Change my view.

EDIT:  I gotta go.  I'll check back in tomorrow (or, if I have time, later tonight).

"CMV: Ignoring nuclear energy is a big middle finger for the planet and experts on the field, while making climate change not look like a crisis at all.",4293,651,2020-02-07 04:05:05,"The  fight against Green House Emissions is focused on one big  transformation: the Energy sector, whose trending solution of the  present is to use renewable energy to eletrify everything we can, and to  produce hydrogen with everything we can't eletrify. (Biofuels for  extreme scenarios).

While trying  to achieve such goals, our natural gas consumption is rising, since it's  a perfect fit for the variability of Renewable Energy.

Meanwhile,  most countries ditch on nuclear energy, which is the perfect  replacement for coal power plants. Discussions surrounding it tend to  compare it with Variable Renewable Energy (VRE), and tend to be biased.

Statements  of ""solar and wind are cheaper than gas at the moment!"" are common, and  unfair, since they do not account with long-term storage any time, and  makes a bad comparison against any type of established energy.

This  further increased when nuclear's main problem are costs, which is a  very respected argument. Yes, while gas is truly cheaper than nuclear,  and, although it emits GHG, it can provide everything nuclear can  (energy-wise), but VRE alone cannot. On top of this, the decomission of  solar and wind is rarely put into consideration. These include  unrecyclable blades and foundations of concrete that are not removed  from the environment, and solar's toxic electronics that can be more  dangerous than nuclear waste. They also come with big, ignored costs,  while nuclear energy takes it into account.

The  worst is the hype surrounding hydrogen. If it ever comes to reality, it  doesn't become only a storage solution: it becomes a necessity for  transport and / or heat. As such, this necessity cannot be based only on  the excess of VRE. So, again, we will be dependant on the most  available process: steam reforming Natural Gas. The funny thing is that  even here nuclear can help, as itsresidual heat is a free source of  energy to produce hydrogen, which usually is dissipated into the water,  going to waste.

I am not saying  nuclear is asolution of everything, but it's a damn good, proven help.  Economics constraints should not be a reason alone to not adopt it. This  energy density would allow us to further evolve ourselves, and there  are tons of things humans put money on for the betterment of humankind,  such as space exploration.

People  mention Chernobyl, but this was one in a kind accident, almost half a  century ago, and experts did tons of work for the betterment of the  technology. Meanwhile, a Banqiao dam breaks in China, kills several  hundred thousand on people, while putting MILLIONS without home and  eletricity, but no-one is scared of them. Because they do not fear it.  They can't even imagine it happening to them.

Every  technology has problems that can be improved and bettered, and plenty of motivated people are working on making it better, cheaper, safer. But it seems that we live in a moment where supporting Renewable Energy and ditching  everything else is the ""good thing"" to do, even if that is actually  making our progress slower in the fight against climate change.

People  fear the complexity of nuclear energy, such as they fear more airplanes  than cars, although everyone knows that cars kill way more persons than  airplanes ever did. Nuclear is the ""Shrek"" that the city is afraid of,  even if he does save the princess at the end.

As long as this fear of a clean, dense and well-established technology,  and disregard of decades of hard-work done from highly inteligent  people, are we really allowed to say that we are facing a climate-change  **crisis?**

CMV: Gender Theory Relies on Sexism or it Falls Apart.,4299,1247,2020-04-30 05:38:33,"So, I've mentioned this in other places and have never gotten a satisfactory answer.

In my view, gender theory relies on extremely rigid and outdated gender norms to formulate a 'spectrum' of gender.  

For example, what would be called a tomboy in the 1980s or so would now be considered ""presenting as less female"" than, say, a makeup wearing cheerleader who always wears skirts. But ask a tomboy who isn't in on modern gender theory if wanting to climb trees makes her less of a woman. I dare you.

I'm a USMC combat veteran. I served with ladies who were in the Lioness program, female Marines in potentially combat roles. They cursed, spit, and could kick the shit out of guys like Milo Yiannoupolos. That doesn't make them any more male than him and it doesn't make him female.

The closest thing to an adequate answer is that none of these things matter for gender. There is in fact no metric whatsoever for gender. It's just a state of mind with no real characteristics. Which makes it entirely useless and fictional.

""Feeling feminine"" is sometimes defined as being more nurtering by gender theory people, but that also implies that being nurturing makes you somehow ""less male,"" which I guess means that fathers are less manly than guys that can't handle Parenthood? That can't be right.

I honestly want to have my view changed because I really don't want to start off every discussion on the subject with the nagging feeling that I'm talking to a bigot, but nothing has so much as nudged me in that direction. Being a tomboy doesn't make you less female. Being a good father doesn't make you less male.",1
"CMV: public schools should be required to teach factual discernment and media literacy as a part of regular curriculum the same as math, science, social studies, etc.",4285,222,2019-01-30 00:11:09,"I graduated from a public high school in the United States and do not have a large depth of understanding into the education systems of other countries so this post will only apply to American institutions. 

Regardless of your political affiliation, “fake news” is a real problem that has only become further exacerbated by the massive rise of the influence of social media. A huge amount of Americans now receive the majority of their news from Facebook which is a platform incentivized not to educate, but to hold users attention for as long a period of time as possible. The consequence of this is a rapid increase in the amount of sensationalized, if not downright fabricated media we as Americans are consuming. 

I was on the debate team when I was in high school years ago. The first thing we learned before ever delivering a speech was how to correctly research facts and how to determine the legitimacy of a source. I personally never received this education anywhere else during my time in school. The importance of this knowledge is that I can feel confident that my political opinions and world views may be subjective but they are based in reality and fact. 

I believe that the most important element going into discourse is that all parties agree on the facts and background of the topic prior to engaging in discussion. I understand that reintroducing something like the 1949 Fairness Doctrine is unrealistic and possibly even unnecessary. I say this because I believe as per our First Amendment rights that media outlets like The Drudge Report, Infowars, and the Huffington Post have every right to espouse whatever rhetoric they choose. 

A major problem with our political system today though largely impacting our polarized climate is that people can choose to subscribe only to the news outlets that already support their opinions. 

People need to agree on the unarguable facts before we can attempt to understand each other and the laws that affect us. Vaccines do not cause autism. Human activity is impacting the global climate. Our drinking water is not turning the frogs gay. 

There are legitimate publications that deliver unbiased factual reporting and there are others that deliver opinion pieces and mistruths. Americans should be educated during their formative years to know the difference so that they then have the knowledge base to be able to form their own legitimate political views regardless of what side of the political spectrum they fall on. 

This is why I believe we should have standardized curriculum in public schools to teach young Americans what media they can trust and what media they should be skeptical of. Change my view. 

Side note:
This post is not about any particular issue or a criticism of any particular outlet. Convincing me that Huffington Post or Infowars is legitimate will not change my view. What the mutually agreed upon sources we reference in this proposed standardized model are is not the discussion, this post is about universally establishing the ability to identify trustworthy media as part of our education system.",1
CMV: Pornography in the form that it is commonly consumed nowadays (graphic videos and images) is not mentally healthy to consume in any dose by anyone.,4269,525,2020-06-17 00:58:40,"Not trying to espouse NoFap propaganda here, just want to get that out of the way first.

Many studies I've seen and heard about are pointing in the direction that consumption of explicit, graphic porn downright changes the structure of the brain in a way which makes it difficult to be aroused from more ""normal"" stimuli (sexual partners). Not unlike how consuming large and/or consistent doses of MDMA or  similar drugs makes it difficult to produce and process serotonin.

I believe it also hampers one's ability to have a sexual imagination which I'd argue is an important thing for a person who is or wants to be sexually active.

Also, as with the consumption of all products, there's no way to know for sure if the people being filmed are safe or consenting to what they are being filmed doing. This could mean that my clicks are aiding and abetting sex trafficking.

I'll conclude by openly admitting that I simply feel a lot of shame around my desire to watch pornography, so I may be simply giving words to this shame. I also was a ""Fapstronaut"" for a year or so and very much believed the claims they made, so would be curious if anyone had any input regarding the efficacy of Nofap (abstaining from masturbation entirely, sometimes also also from sex) as well.",1
"CMV: The comforts of modern life should make us euphoric, and the fact that they don't is troubling because it suggests the human perspective is critically flawed.",4267,321,2019-05-24 06:53:17,"Today, I awoke in a temperature-controlled room, shared with my life's partner, on a piece of furniture specifically engineered for comfort while sleeping. I slept soundly, thanks to the lack of interruption due to predators or pests. When I awoke, I walked over a cushioned and carpeted path into a room designed for my personal cleanliness, before washing myself in the luxury of temperature-controlled water with various soaps and liquids specifically engineered for caring for my skin.  


After this, I dried myself with a fluffed cotton towel, before pulling clean, colorful clothing from a $1500 dresser set. I retrieved my state-of-the-art cellular device, before reviewing the variety of communications waiting for me from friends and loved ones, along with educating myself on daily news events with the swipe of a finger.  


I then pressed a button to produce a brewed coffee more delicious than any trading post would have dreamed of 100 years ago, while adding gourmet Hazelnut flavoring. I fed my pleasant fur companions, all of which who were happy and in good health. I hopped into the cushioned seat of my car, which is worth several thousand dollars, selected the exact artist and song from the last 50 years that I wished to listen to, and then moved 3 times faster in my car than what would be biologically possible, all while breathing in air at the exact temperature I find comfortable.  


After this short journey, I arrived at a temperature-controlled building, greeted with a task that if completed correctly, would grant me more 13x the pay that an average Sub-Saharan African would make in the same day. While doing so, I once again selected the exact musical artist from a selection of millions that would suit my tastes for the day. At no point was I concerned with hunger, sickness, predators, violence, or any other of the standard unpleasantness that have been faced daily by 99% of all mammals that have ever existed.

And yet, throughout this process, I grumbled over my alarm, grumbled over work, grumbled over my budget, grumbled over what others had that I did not, etc etc.  


When comparing my life to someone in the same country, at a similar social class, 200 years ago, my life is incredible and filled with conveniences and luxuries that they couldn't even dream of. And even those people in the 1800's were living lives that were free of most of the burdens that other living things face daily. So why hasn't the modern American had an increase in happiness that correlates with the increase in improved quality of life over the last 300 years?

"CMV: Democrat Response to Tara Reade shows Kavanaugh Uproar was more about stopping candidate they didn't like, rather than respecting Ford's allegations",4261,1251,2020-05-01 00:15:18,"I firmly believe both political parties are subject to this type of behavior, this is not limited to Democrats only.  Republican's have no claim to moral high ground when nominating President Trump.   Personally I voted third party in 2016 because I couldn't vote for Clinton or Trump.

During the uproar regarding Dr. Ford's allegations, so many democrats came out and said quite strongly to believe the woman, she faces so many negative consequences (very true) by coming forward, that by the nature of making the allegations she deserves to be heard.  Her story dominated the news cycle for quite some time.  But now that allegations of sexual harassment and criminal behavior have been directed at a prominent Democratic person (presidential nominee!) so many democrats either ignore the story or  contradict their own earlier statements of ""believe the woman"" (Biden himself included).

**Looking back at the Kavanaugh process through the current light, it seems so many democrats rallied around Dr Ford's allegations not because they believed the moral principal of ""believe the woman"" but because they didn't like Kavanaugh as a candidate.**

My frustration largely is that Democrats are seen as the party of moral high ground.  When in reality, it is ""Democrats believe and support Women fighting to share their story, except when it is inconvenient to do so""  To my  view, this means no differentiation between Democrats or Republicans regarding claims of sexual harassment or assault by women.

If Democrats truly wanted to follow their stated belief of ""Believe the woman"" they would nominate Bernie Sanders as the candidate

**I can't reconcile current treatment of Biden with the treatment of Kavanaugh by Democrats, if you can please change my view.**

Edit 4: Thank you everyone for sharing your opinions and perspectives.  I've tried to read most of the responses, and the vast majority were well written and articulate responses that give hope to a responsible American people, regardless of who the politicians in power are.  Further it was encouraging to me to see Biden come out and personally deny the allegations.  Regardless of the truthfulness of who is right, him or Reade, it shows respect for us as Americans who need a response from the accused.   His silence was frustrating to me.  I look forward to more evaluation by the media, leaders in power and the American public to vote for who they think the next president should be.  I appreciate your contribution to the dialogue and changing the outdated response that Men in power should be given the benefit of the doubt, yet also acknowledging the challenges when accusations are made, and the need for evidence and evaluating both sides of the story.

CMV: At least one third party candidate should be allowed in the national debates regardless of their polling percentage.,4260,372,2020-04-20 04:14:44,"Right now the rule is a candidate needs to poll at 15% to be in the national debate. A lot of people including myself think this is terribly unfair and prevents any real chance of a third party candidate being taken seriously.
I think they should take the candidate from a third party that polls the highest among all the third party candidates and let them in the debate regardless of their numbers.
Ex. 
Party A Candidate: 3%
Party B Candidate: 5%
Party C Candidate: 4%

Party B candidate should be allowed to debate even though they haven’t hit the 15% threshold. 
Having a third party candidate that’s taken seriously will help ensure that the two main parties are sending up the best person for the job rather than somebody that can simply beat the candidate from the other party. Plus it will give people a viable third option.  Rather than feeling g trapped into voting one or the other or “throwing your vote away”
And finally it gives more versatility as far as people aligning with the appropriate party. AOC said herself that Bernie Sanders does not belong in the same party as Joe Biden. I think this is absolutely true, however the only shot Bernie had at becoming president was to run as a Democrat. If third parties were more recognized he could run as an independent or a different more progressive party and thus more followers identify as that and a new party rises. This is essentially how the Republican Party was originally formed.
Just to be clear, my case isn’t that Bernie isn’t a Democrat or something like that, it’s the third party debate part.

"CMV: A coding course offering a flat £500 discount to women is unfair, inefficient, and potentially illegal.",4244,1540,2018-10-23 18:57:13,"Temp account, because I do actually want to still do this course and would rather there aren't any ramifications for just asking a question in the current climate (my main account probably has identifiable information), but there's a coding bootcamp course I'm looking to go on in London (which costs a hell of a lot anyway!) but when I went to the application page it said women get a £500 discount.

What's the precedent for this kind of thing? Is this kind of financial positive discrimination legal in the UK? I was under the impression gender/race/disability are protected classes. I'm pretty sure this is illegal if it was employment, just not sure about education. But then again there are probably plenty of scholarships and bursaries for protected classes, maybe this would fall under that. It's just it slightly grinds my gears, because most of the women I know my age (early 30s), are doing better than the men, although there's not much between it.

If their aim is to get more people in general into coding, it's particularly inefficient, because they'd scoop up more men than women if they applied the discount evenly. Although if their goal is to change the gender balance in the industry, it might help. Although it does have the externality of pissing off people like me (not that they probably care about that haha). I'm all for more women being around! I've worked in many mostly female work environments. But not if they use financial discrimination to get there. There's better ways of going about it that aren't so zero sum, and benefit all.

To be honest, I'll be fine, I'll put up with it, but it's gonna be a little awkward being on a course knowing that my female colleagues paid less to go on it. I definitely hate when people think rights are zero sum, and it's a contest, but this really did jump out at me.

I'm just wondering people's thoughts, I've spoken to a few of my friends about this and it doesn't bother them particularly, both male and female, although the people who've most agreed with me have been female ironically.

Please change my view!  It would certainly help my prospects!

edit: So I think I'm gonna stop replying because I am burnt out!  I've also now got more karma in this edgy temp account than my normal account, which worries me haha.  I'd like to award the D to everyone, you've all done very well, and for the most part extremely civil!  Even if I got a bit shirty myself a few times.  Sorry. :)

I've had my view changed on a few things:

* It is probably just about legal under UK law at the moment.
* And it's probably not a flashpoint for a wider culture war for most companies, it's just they view it as a simple market necessity that they NEED a more diverse workforce for better productivity and morale.  Which may or may not be true.  The jury is still out.
* Generally I think I've 'lightened' my opinions on the whole thing, and will definitely not hold it against anyone, not that I think I would have.

I still don't think the problem warrants this solution though, I think the £500 would be better spent on sending a female coder into a school for a day to do an assembly, teach a few workshops etc... It addresses the root of the problem, doesn't discriminate against poorer men, empowers young women, a female coder gets £500, and teaches all those kids not to expect that only men should be coders!  And doesn't piss off entitled men like me :P

But I will admit that on a slightly separate note that if I make it in this career, I'd love for there to be more women in it, and I'd champion anyone who shows an interest (I'm hanging onto my damn 500 quid though haha!).  I just don't think this is the best way to go about it.  To all the female coders, and male nurses, and all you other Billy Elliots out there I wish you the best of luck!",1
CMV: Those who hate on Fat people are NOT genuinely concerned about their health. They just find Fat people repulsive.,4227,961,2020-01-14 10:28:20,"I would love to be convinced that you are genuinely sooo concerned about the health of a total stranger that you feel the need to leave comments on their social media AND devote entire subreddits to your hatefulness because you’re just incredibly concerned about their heart and blood sugar levels. Give me a break. Why can’t people just admit they find fat people gross? Why try to justify it with some faux concern about their wellbeing? 

Here’s how I know it’s bull. If you see a pic of a skinny person, you don’t see comments asking whether they smoke cigs, how much they drink, whether they ate too little or exercised too much, whether they slept well, whether they drank 8 glasses of water that day, whether they purged to fit into that swimsuit. Why? Because it’s ridiculous and none of your business and impossible to give an accurate health assessment based on a photo (even if you’re a doctor, which these weird haters generally are not). 

Also, anorexia is the most deadly mental disorder. Not binge eating. Anorexia. Yet I don’t see half of the “disgust” and outrage over pics of extremely skinny women as I do over larger women. People might express some kind concern in the most extreme cases (and I’m talking ribs showing), but then it’s mostly kind and gentle without name calling or cruel judgments. 

I just need people to be honest and say that fat bodies gross them out. You really don’t care if that overweight man has a heart attack. You just don’t. And if you did, what in the world makes you think leaving judgmental comments is going to help? Do you think fat people don’t know they’re fat? Like this is some special revelatory fact that only you were able to impart?

Also, it’s generally a bit taboo to comment on another person’s health and diagnose them unless they specifically ask. Yet, fat people often don’t receive that consideration. They aren’t afforded that dignity. 

This really isn’t super personal for me. I’ve been big, I’ve been small. Never extreme in either direction. But I know lots of people who *do* fit into an extreme category and the way they’re treated has always baffled me. At the very least, be straight up with your hatred. Don’t hide.

**EDIT: Okay, this blew up while I was sleeping so let me say one more thing. A lot of this thread shows me that there is a real empathy problem at the core of a lot of this. You don’t know what anyone is going through. People like to say fat people with legit medical issues causing weight gain are rare. But this totally ignores MENTAL health. Depression and anxiety are just a few mental disorders that come to mind. It’s also interesting that people acknowledge that those who binge and purge suffer from mental illness. But those who simply binge are lazy slobs who have no excuse? Again, you have no idea what a person is going through.  And, contrary to popular belief, tons of meds CAUSE weight gain as an unintended side effect. The cruel irony is that some of those meds are precisely what people take to deal with their mental health issues!! Lots of people have messaged me privately about their struggles highlighting the cruelty they’ve experienced for existing in a fat body. The truth is, I don’t care how you feel about fat people. But you don’t have the right to make judgments and play internet doctor and tell people how to deal with their own MEDICAL issues.

As of 2018 [46.1%](https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_offenses.jsp) of those incarcerated in the federal prison system (1 or more years imprisoned/sentenced) are there due to drug offenses. Additionally, the average cost of imprisonment in the federal systems costs [$36,299.25](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/04/30/2018-09062/annual-determination-of-average-cost-of-incarceration) a year (FY17). These two statistics together mean that, just at the federal level, we spend $2,838,383,554.5 on their incarceration alone.

And these are all without even touching on individual state expenditure where some states pay as high as [$69,355](https://www.vera.org/publications/price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends/price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends/price-of-prisons-2015-state-spending-trends-prison-spending) per year (FY2015) to keep individuals incarcerated.

Through the decriminalization/legalization of these drugs we would be saving money that could be funneled toward much more beneficial systems (education, science & technology, other federal agencies) or which could be used to help with further prison reform (rehabilitation, reintegration of parole/releasees, etc.).

The ""War on Drugs"" doesn't make sense to me from the standpoint of either political party whereas Republicans claim to be fiscally conservative yet push for a policy of deterrence when it comes to drug crimes and Democrats only take minor steps towards partial drug policy reform (legalization of cannabis in some states as an example).

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this matter and what views you all hold.

CMV: LGBTQ+ members who hate on hetero people are missing their own points,4169,753,2020-05-27 19:44:27,"before i explain my point: i am extremely supportive of the lgbtq community and i'm very happy at everything they accomplished. 

i understand how privileged i must come across, but i've seen many people use things like ""straight white man"" as an insult. and this in itself doesn't offend me at all, but wasn't the whole point of lgbtq-rights that everyone's equal, regardless of their sexuality? 
why are we still putting each other down for things they don't have any control over? it makes me feel hopeless.",1
CMV: Making your bed is pointless.,4168,623,2020-04-19 03:12:23,"Why make your bed to just get in it again? Apart from discipline and neatness, I don’t see why to make your bed.

I also find that my covers fall less when I don’t make my bed. Plus, it also feels cosier when it’s not made. On top of that, the bed is tighter and you can’t feel loose to roll around as much in bed.

Overall, I think making my bed is wasting my time just so I can be colder (due to falling covers) and more uncomfortable. 

However, I know that my opinion is flawed so I would appreciate it if someone explains why I should make my bed.",1
"CMV: Public outrage about the wackier fringe of ""SJWs"" is entirely disproportionate to the actual size of the phenomenon and is being deliberately stoked by those who oppose fair and equitable treatment for women and minorities.",4167,715,2018-05-28 01:55:25,"Additionally I'd say that progressives who publicly mock the small weirdo fringe of the SJW movement are acting as useful idiots for the far right and effectively doing their work for them. 

Don't misunderstand me though, I'm a full advocate for freedom of speech laws and the right of anyone to say anything they want. (Short of violent threats.)

This is a *moral* issue, not a legal one. Of course it's your right to say and joke about anything but I personally think that biting your tongue is better for the (legitimate) progressive movement than drawing even more attention to the weirdo fringe.

Those people don't represent what the vast majority of people who are passionate about social justice are about. 

Within the category of ""unwitting idiots"" I have a number of YouTube channels in mind. They've pivoted in recent years to focus quite heavily on videos focusing on the more outrageous SJWs on the internet. 

Yes those weirdos exist and yes it's your right to make a living mocking them but it's misrepresenting what (decent) progressive politics is about to an often young and impressionable audience. This is one of the reasons we've ended up with so many little Nazi edgelords instead of reasonably informed young people with a clear eyed, balanced view of the world.

Again, it's anyone's right to make and distribute this stuff but on a broader societal level it's leading us down a dangerous path.

Anyways, apologies for the supplementary essay. For what it's worth I'd consider myself a moderate and find the wacky fringe SJWs to be a real PR problem for the progressive movement. They deserve to be mocked but the consequences of doing so are akin to pouring gasoline on a fire instead of letting itself burn out.",1
CMV: Normalizing obesity for the sake of body positivity is dangerous,4167,547,2019-06-01 23:16:21,"As obesity rates continue to rise, I've seen more and more focus put on ""body positivity"", which as you likely know is a movement that seeks to teach people that you should be comfortable with whatever size or shape you are.

I disagree with this movement and view it as potentially very dangerous.

While I haven't looked extensively into scientific reporting on the subject, I think there very clearly can be a link between the two when thinking about it with common sense:

If you tell an impressionable child or teenager that they should always be happy with their body regardless of what people say, this will lead to them believing they should not focus on their physical health as much as they should.

This is a dangerous mindset, as normalizing obesity for the sake of positive mental health can lead to a drastic degradation in one's physical health.

Noted here: [""[Obesity] is related to ≈1–400 000 deaths per year and costs society an estimated $117 billion in direct and indirect costs.""](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/82/1/207S/4863384)

And here: [""Obesity, diabetes, and population rates will contribute to an estimated $1.24 billion/yr increases in the cost of kidney stones by 2030.""](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4227394/)

**A more responsible lesson to teach would be you shouldn't feel SHAME in regards to your body, but you do need to focus on combating obesity to the best of your ability so you don't suffer it's adverse effects (increased chance of heart disease, medical costs, etc).**

This is not a pro-fat-shaming view, as I don't think anyone should be shamed for their body, but promoting that everyone should always be accepting of their weight in any case is dangerous.

I'm aware I haven't taken into account genetic or other medically-related cases of obesity - but I still think promoting a healthy lifestyle is more important than accepting your body the way it is, and people in those cases should do their best to receive help from medical professionals regarding it rather than ignoring it.",1
CMV: Trying to get people to vote regardless of how much or how little they actually know about politics is unhelpful.,4143,254,2020-03-11 19:59:27,"I get that voting is a really good thing, and exercising your right to do so is a magnificent part of the freedom that we have in the west, however I strongly dispute the idea that everyone should vote and that high voter turnout is always positive.

I'm from the UK and our last election was my first being able to vote, as was the same for pretty much all of my friends. During the election I heard some of the most ridiculous reasons for voting for a candidate, genuine examples include ""Yellow is the most neutral colour"", ""Desmond sounds like a rich man name"" and a personal favourite ""Jo Swinson's tits are bigger than my head."" These are all people who voted because they were told that it was their duty, but didn't actually care enough to look into it. We constantly see complaining about voter stupidity and identity politics, so stop telling uninformed idiots who are perfectly happy staying out of it that they need to vote!

I get that when one of your friends or family is a clean political slate that it's tempting to try and convert them to follow your ideology, but we just end up with a skewed idea of what people actually care about. My girlfriend changed her mind on who she was voting for almost daily because various different people filled her head with crap, and she ended up voting conservative because her Dad owns a business and said he'd cut her off if she didn't. That's the level we're at. I deliberately avoided the discussion with her because I don't want her to vote for what I think, I want her to look into it herself and come to a conclusion. Influencing those around you to vote for what YOU personally believe in just breeds a society of sheeple too lazy to research the issues before deciding who they want running the fucking country.

EDIT: Just to be clear, I am not suggesting people don't vote. I'm saying that people who clearly have no interest in policy and vote purely off of social pressure to do so should be allowed to simply abstain without stigma.

I disagree with people and groups who parade as being impartial and merely ""trying to increase turnout"" whilst actually using it as an opportunity to campaign for their own party. You should be trying to win over those who are informed and can think critically before going after non-voters who are easier to convert.",1
"CMV: Most religions, as we know them, now relies on perpetual indoctrination of children who as adults (understandably) cannot imagine believing and living in any other way than the religion taught them",4136,327,2020-01-26 18:22:05,"If, hypothetically, for the following 15 to 20 years no one would teach any kind of religion to anybody. That's the end of most western and middle eastern religion as we know it. It would collapse in a matter of decades as the other generations would die off, with no one to continue the legacy. Meanwhile all the people would have to rely on teachings of humanities - psychology, sociology, philosophy etc... 

All religions have some really important values and teachings to take from them, spheres where even secular humanities cannot yet reach. 
But they also have, excuse my language a lot of bullsh*t. A tradition for the sake of tradition. What I believe would happen is that people would pick up the corpses of the religion and pick from them what really has value and meaning to them - relying also on the teachings they would already know from humanities while adopting religious values and meanings. 

This would give rise to value systems and meanings (love, justice, beauty, etc...) without the grand ""papa"" who behaves like a warlord who needs to be pleased and who punishes everybody who doesn't follow him like he wants to. Along with all of bullsh*t, hurtful traditions and teachings which are all just interpretations of backwards men who hide behind devotion and ""love"". 

I'm just sad what people are willing to do just for the sake of religion and it's tradition. There is no other reason for cutting and sucking boys penis other than tradition, there is no other reason for hating people of other sexual orientation other than tradition, there is no other reason for jews and Palestinians behaving like animals to each other than tradition. 

I know what great potential religions and their teachings can have but we have to stop this awful interpretations of their teachings and start once again now with rational analysis of their material, leaning on the teachings of humanities that we already have in 21st century (psychology, sociology, philosophy). 

Religions didn't survive to the 21st century because they encapsulate the best life a person can live.
They survived in all their forms because they close off and shut off most of the outside, secular influences while they continue to indoctrinate next generations of their followers. 
Rabi of ultra orthodox jews in Israel said it himself - if our boys go to an army, they will become more and more secular and then run away from our community. Well doesn't that just show on how fragile legs your teachings stand on? If the boys cannot live and function with your religion in real life (or even the army), only in a closed of community, in your little bubble of life and what you want it to be - sorry you really need to think through your teaching.

This is just my opinion. Badly informed and probably not well written argument which relies on little research and mostly just impressions. I just want to start a discussion. Would really like some man educated in theology to give his take on this problem.
My point at the end is - some (if not most) religions need really serious reformation, if not on an almost destruction of its building blocks. 

My thought of 15-20 years of ban of religion was just thought experiment.",1
"CMV: As a young white man in America, I feel worthless, disconnected from and hated by women/minorities, and – though I want equality – unwelcome in the conversation.",4138,1041,2018-03-30 07:31:50,"Hey, /r/changemyview –

I'm struggling. I'm struggling because, my whole life, I've wanted fairness and equality – but over the past year I've become bitter and lost. I want to help build a better world – but, because I'm white and male, I feel profoundly unwelcome in the conversation going on right now. Sometimes, I even feel scared by it. 

I don't need you to convince me that equality is important, or that inequalities still exist. (Of course they do.) Nor do I need to you to explain how, as a white dude, I'm privileged. (Believe me, I know.) But I am hoping you can help me see a better way forward than self-flagellation and guilt, which doesn't help me and certainly doesn't help anybody else. 

So, to unpack this stuff a little:

I feel worthless. Everywhere I look, I see articles about how terrible people who look like me are, and I feel ashamed. I feel guilty. I feel like I can't be proud of who I am – and I don't mean proud of my external characteristics (in the way that people sometimes say misguided stuff on here like, ""Why can't we have a 'White Pride Day'?"") but proud of who I am, deep down, as an individual person. It's hard because everywhere I look I see positive role models from other genders/races, and I want to be positive, too. But white men are pretty vilified and there's not a lot of examples on how I can be a decent person and actually help. The message I get is that I should just shut up and bask in my privilege, because society is done with me. Deep down, I'm a caring, emotional person and I'm buckling because I feel like I can't rise above the narrative in the media: that white people, men, and especially white men are just awful.

I think a part of me feels like I should suffer, because of my privilege.  So I read social justice news frequently.  But I'm exhausted – enough so that small things are starting to get to me. Today, for instance, I saw an article about whether or not ""people of color"" is an acceptable term to use and I kind of lost it internally – not because I don't care if the term is acceptable or not, but because I feel like I can't be this perfect white man who never offends anyone accidentally. There are so many angry articles I've read and I'd like to say that we could all be angry about the problem but it feels like we're angry at each other. And it's making it hard for me to see myself and others as individuals – the exact opposite of what I want. These days I walk around feeling like people hate me, scared that even if they're nice to me they're just thinking the same things these articles say.

It doesn't really feel like the narrative of equality today is, ""let's build a better world together."" It feels more like, ""white men have caused all of these problems so you guys just go sit in a corner."" And it makes me angry, because I want to help, and I don't believe that the best way for me to help is just go bask in my privilege and die. I want to say, I'm here for this, and I want to help, but you have to let me be an individual who is imperfect and not just ""an evil white dude"". 

Ugh. I know this is rambling and probably incoherent – the more I type, I'm getting emotional. 

Anyway, please try to change my view. I don't want to keep feeling shitty and wind up a bitter, Trump voter in 2020 (lol). I want to be part of this, and help, but I feel so unwelcome and lost. 

PS: I'm going to be here for the next few hours because I'm taking this seriously and will reply in good faith.

EDIT: Thanks for the productive conversation so far. I've got to step away for a little now but I'll check back in a few hours and reply some more.

CMV: There is a stronger case for a maximum age for US Presidential eligibility than a minimum age,4116,190,2020-02-04 08:15:12,"The US constitution requires a candidate to be 35 years or older to be President. Donald Trump was the oldest candidate to be elected President at age 70, and three leading candidates for the Democratic nomination in 2020 (Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren) are in their 70s (with Sanders, the oldest, being 79 on the day of the 2020 election).

I personally lean towards there being no age restrictions (beyond reaching the age of majority, and I’m not even that concerned about that) to run for President. But I think if we’re going to accept the logic of them, an upper age limit makes at least as much sense as a minimum age.

The argument for minimum age limits is primarily that younger candidates will often be too inexperienced and immature to handle the office of President. The argument for maximum age limits is primarily that older candidates have a heightened risk of death, impairment and/or cognitive decline.

I think both of these are reasonable concerns. But I don’t see either as being clearly worse than the other. 

The primary argument I see *against* age restrictions is that “We should let the voters decide!” And I think this is a powerful argument and why I lean against age restrictions (and indeed, other restrictions like “natural born citizenship”). If voters think Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden is too old to be President, they can vote for a different candidate. If they think they’re still effective in spite of their age, then they can vote for them. That’s fine, although I think this logic would apply **just as well** to candidates currently too young to run for President. If Alexandria-Ocasio Cortez wanted to run for President in 2020, and people thought she was too young and inexperienced, they could vote against her for that reason.

So is there any case for age restrictions? Well, I think it has to boil down to a belief that the 
“popular will” is sometimes suboptimal and can be influenced by irrationality, or get stuck in some kind of bad equilibrium. (Bryan Caplan’s book [The Myth of the Rational Voter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_the_Rational_Voter) is a notable work making this kind of claim).

If we’re accepting that logic, we need to think: is it more likely that these processes will lead to voters choosing a candidate who is “too young”, or “too old”?

What could make voters “irrationally” support a 34-year-old for office? A possible path could involve being a family member of a popular politician and then taking advantage of the [“halo effect”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect) of being better-looking than older politicians. A possible example of this has occurred with the Kennedy family. An (entirely theoretical) way this might have affected the Presidency would have been if 32-year-old Ted Kennedy had run and won the Presidency in 1964 after the assassination of his brother.

What could make voters “irrationally” support a 78-year-old for office? Probably the main reason is having name recognition from a long career. I think Joe Biden could be a real-life example of this, Sanders also has it to some degree. (Note: I’m not saying that it is *necessarily* irrational to support someone who has had a long career - perhaps in many cases it’s a reasonable signal of experience! But I think it’s more likely than other indicators to be somewhat shallow).  

If we look at US history (and that of other countries), it seems to me that the latter scenario seems a lot more common than the former. The youngest President was Teddy Roosevelt at 42 and the youngest elected President was JFK at 43, and to my knowledge, there have been no plausible major-party nominees under the age of 35 who might have won had the age restriction not existed. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, note that “irrationality” doesn’t have to mean that voters are necessarily dumb, they might just be facing a collective action problem. For instance, I believe it's possible that if all voters were given the chance to reflect and then could wave a magic wand to make either Joe Biden or (e.g) Amy Klobuchar President, the majority would pick Klobuchar. Nonetheless, marginal Biden voters who want a moderate candidate risk that defecting to Klobuchar would instead help Sanders or Warren, so they largely don't. In a world where Biden was constitutionally ineligible to run, Klobuchar’s campaign may have done a lot better. 

Another issue could be “future-proofing” a second term. Imagine for the sake of example that either Biden or Sanders won in 2020, then ran again in 2024. They would be 82 or 83, respectively. Let’s say they had some noticeable cognitive decline. Could we trust them to step down and/or lose renomination/reelection because of this? Maybe, but maybe not. After all, there’s been a precedent in the Senate to re-elect very old incumbents, most notably [93-year-old Sturm Thurmond in South Carolina in 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_United_States_Senate_election_in_South_Carolina). Incumbent Presidents almost never lose re-nomination, and partisanship and “fundamentals” like the economy tend to matter at least as much as candidate quality in the general election. It’s easy to imagine an almost-senile incumbent being penalised by voters for this but still winning, then getting progressively worse over the four-year term. 

Again, I’m undecided about whether an upper age limit is a good idea. I think “let the voters decide” is a reasonable argument. But I think if you’re going to discount that, I don’t think there’s a good case for there to *only* be a minimum age of 35.",1
CMV: Safe spaces are unhealthy because college students need to stop hiding from views that upset them.,4111,952,2016-08-15 15:17:21,"In the college environment we are supposed to be challenging old ideas and popular opinions. Safe spaces go against the logic of the scientific method because they leave no room for hypotheses that offend or discomfort people. This is the same line of thinking that led to people believing the Earth was flat and everything revolves around us. It is not only egocentric but flat out apprehensive to need a safe space to discuss and debate. How will students possibly transition into the real world if they cannot have a simple discussion without their opinion being challenged? We need to not only be open to being wrong, but skeptical of being right.  ",1
"CMV: If their is a Joker related shooting it will be because of the media and those scared of it, not because of the movie itself",4106,554,2019-10-04 19:33:48,"Edit 2: Fine odds are good the Joker (the character) had nothing to do with the Colarado shooting and that was just a dumb rumor

Edit: Alright I really didn't expect this post to blow up like this, especially in the first 20 minutes or so when it hung onto a score like 2, then suddenly went into the hundreds. I thought this would get lot 20 or 30 comments tops, then get lost in the sea of topics. Fyi it's on a score 796 with 174 replies at the time of this edit.

I've gotta go now and I won't be back for several hours and honest I'm not sure I'm gonna reply to everyone else who posts. Also yes, I know I used the wrong there in the title.

While I still think sensationalist, click chasing buzz around the movie is more dangerous than the movie, I do acknowledge that movie's appeal to disenfranchised white guys could stir some thoughts in people and I understand how people could imagine the movie being dangerous for awakening those kind of thoughts or encouraging someone on edge to act out, in the same way 13 reasons might do the same for suicidal thoughts (don't watch 13 reasons if you're suicidal. Actually don't watch 13 reasons, it sucks) .

I can see how people who feel on the fringes of society might relate to the Joker, especially those communities, though i still don't believe they actually embraced him as a symbol or meme before Gamers Rise Up and no one has linked to a meme of such that existed before Gamers Rise Up even with the promise of a Delta for doing so. Though I could see edgelords finding him appealing.





The Joker has existed since the 30s, and has inspired NO SHOOTINGS, since even the COlarado one had nothing to do with it.

The movie itself in no way glorifies or justifies the alt right, violent white men, or the violent part of the incel community or Incels in general.

The Joker as a symbol of incels and channers and the alt right thing has not been a  thing before GamersRiseUp and the like actually inventing the ""We live in a society"" meme linking them together, and progressive, click hungry, clickbait, outrage seeking media pushing it as a narrative. If it ever comes to be, it will because of them, as the link did not exist before, even though the character has existed throughout both the rise of the original Nazis and Neo Nazis and even the KKKs resurgence, yet none of these saw fit to adopt him as a symbol, even with the same group of angry white men and the far right. I don't even think Hitler cared about Batman.

If there was no media buzz, outrage chasers, pseudo activists (because imo you shouldn't call yourself an activist unless your actually using your activism to do good in the world.) , etc this film would come and go without much more fuss than a movie like Venom, beyond being better received and remembered.

But now any would be shooter has the promise that if they do this, their manfeso, viewpoints and everything their trying to do will be given the greatest megaphone they could ever ask for, and people proptadly against them to boot, their names will be immortalised and their actions and manifesto will live on in the public conscious for weeks, months or even years, which gives them far more motivation than just a movie about an edgy Batman character.

Even if a shooting doesn't happen, if Joker ends up becoming an unironic chan and or incel symbol, it will be because of the media and outrage chasers pushing so hard.

And of course the far left branding this movie as dangerous and toxic and giving off Jack Thompson esque Diatribes about the film, will only make it that much enticing and fascinating to the far right and edgy channers and incels their supposedly trying to curb",1
CMV: The 2 party system and the electoral college are destroying America.,4101,671,2017-12-25 11:47:56,"The 2 party system creates an us vs. them mentality that is destroying our country. Most people immediately see someone in the opposite political party and disregard their opinion. Furthermore, 2 parties does not create enough to encompass everyone's beliefs. Many people agree with one party on some issues and the other party on other issues. However, the electoral college forces a 2 party system. It is near impossible for a 3rd party to gain enough traction to succeed. Therefore, I believe that we should abolish the electoral college and elect officials via a popular vote. An argument I hear against this is that candidates wont rally in smaller states, but this is not a problem thanks to the age of technology we live in. Smaller states can get an understanding of and form an opinon on a candidate without ever seeing them in person, via the internet and television. I also think we should abolish all parties and elect people purely based on their opinions. This will create more options for the public and a more informed public. Instead of having to choose the lesser of 2 evils, people can actually vote for someone they believe in. In conclusion, the electoral college and the 2 party system are horrible for the general public and should be abolished.

Update: WOW I was not expecting to get this many comments. I'm trying to read them all but if I don't respond to your comment, I'm sorry.

Just eat food that is good but not total junk food like good meat, whole grain carb, some vegetable, sweets in moderation, dairy for calcium and fruit to cut down on sugar craving , etc.

I just think if you try to hard to live by a super healthy diet, you're not living a fun life, you're just living a life to keep your body in top shape. Of course your relationships with people make life worth living, but if you stick to food needing to be healthy to be worth eating, you miss out on a lot of potentially good experiences. When you dedicate yourself to eating totally healthily you just have such a strict mindset, you end up not being open to enjoy life as much as you could.

I don't know if there is any objective way to explicitly determine what should be considered 'appropriate for children'- but I think, for example, that most reasonable person would agree that seeing a nipple (not allowed on TV) should be considered significantly more appropriate for children than seeing a violent murder (totally allowed on TV).",1
"CMV: Christmas has evolved past the confines of Christianity, and the cultural traditions so heavily out weigh the religious traditions that everyone should feel welcome to celebrate it regardless of their religion.",4080,374,2018-12-10 02:52:27,"My point is basically that if you look at all of the Christmas traditions: the Santa mythos, the music, the trees, the cookies, etc. they extremely out weigh the actual Christianity of it. And because of that we should abandon the notion that just because you celebrate Christmas you also have to celebrate the birth of Christ and Christianity. Instead treating them as separate but joinable entities. You can celebrate Christmas with or without the Christianity of it and no one should feel guilty celebrating the holiday of their religion conflicts with Christian views. 


~~For example, how many Christmas songs other than “Away in a Manger” and “Silent Night” do you know that actually have to do with Jesus?~~ Now compare that against all the songs you know about Santa. There’s a lot more of the later. You don’t see Jesus in the malls and drinking Coke with polar bears on TV. 

Even though most of these traditions have pagan origins, the tree, the lights, etc. we still associate the holiday with the birth of Christ instead of the actual calendar land mark, the winter solstice (similar to how Halloween arose to celebrate the Fall Equinox)

I guess my main point is that we have this big cultural holiday that is 99% cultural, but because of the 1% religious part of it, a lot of people feel they can’t celebrate it. And they take Christmas out of schools and say Happy Holidays and avoid it 

when it should be viewed  is like Thanksgiving where you would never think “oh I shouldn’t celebrate Thanksgiving because of my religion” and you wouldn’t hesitate to put up finger turkeys around the office, pumpkins on Halloween, or patriotic flags on the 4th of July. 

The religious part should be a sort of subset, or an add on, where should you wish to celebrate the actual birth of Christ on Christmas you most certainly can, but if you choose to celebrate Christmas without acknowledging the birth of Christ, that’s also equally acceptable. Just put up some lights and leave out cookies for Santa. 

Edit: there are a TON of Christian Christmas songs, that was a bad example on my part that distracted from the point. ",1
CMV: There is nothing morally wrong with pirating old games that have no available remakes.,4071,480,2019-08-25 22:22:12,"A perfect example of a game I am thinking of is 2002's Super Mario Sunshine. That game is coming up on 17 years old and has no available remakes. The *only* way to play the game ""legally"" is to buy a copy which will be used. Buying this used copy does not support the developers. So there is nothing morally wrong with pirating a game like this (that is old and has no available remake), because there is no way to play it in a way that supports the devs anyway, so what are the devs missing out on by you pirating it instead?

CMV: the “NSFW” abbreviation needs changed to become 2 different abbreviations: one for nudity and one for everything else.,4079,183,2018-02-20 20:05:02,"We’ve all seen the little red “NSFW” tag on reddit. 

Most of the time the tag works well - there is usually boobs and butts behind the click - I’m glad not to click those during my lunch break. 

However... most of us work alongside other adults, so opening a creepy image or a video of a skater falling on their ass is perfectly ok to open in work. 

I just think that the NSFW tag is too broad. Honestly, at home, I’m ok looking at your weight loss pics that maybe have a little too much flesh showing... but surely it’s ok for me to show my buddy the latest pic from /r/creepy on our lunch break?

So I think there should now be 2 abbreviations:

NSFWN - nude stuff

NSFWO - other. 

Agree?

Given how resistant Reddit are to change, I’m not suggesting something like this would ever come to pass but I think it would greatly improve how Reddit works. 

Edit for additional:

After reading some of your replies I see there are a few extra things to consider:

1) Maybe my suggestion for improving the NSFW tag is not the best and I’m happy to read your suggestions on how it might work better. 

2) I’ve learned that there is a tag “NSFL” which is used for gore etc. Problem is it doesn’t get used in the right places. 

For instance: a post titled “when it goes wrong at the gym” is marked NSFW it could be anything from a guys shorts getting eaten by the treadmill, to a guys knees getting snapped on the leg press. 

(That’s my case in point)

 

Edit: additional additional:

As pointed out in the comments... some people might be actively expecting some nudity when clicking a NSFW but end up with some gore etc. 

Again, further proving that the NSFW tag is fundamentally broken.  ",1

CMV: having an obese child (10 and under) should be considered child abuse,3996,696,2019-07-18 12:04:14,"At such a young age parents play a much larger role in a child’s diet than the child does. Kids eat what’s in front of them, and they’ll eat as much of it as you’ll let them. Therefore, if a child is obese (and doesn’t have a preexisting medical condition that may effect their weight) it’s largely the parents fault, and that parent is actively hurting that child. Not only is the child at an increased risk for countless diseases, they’re far more likely to be bullied, be physically uncomfortable, to suffer from mental illnesses, and to have an unhealthy view of their own bodies. Obesity can’t just be fixed by hitting the gym a few times, and even if the child loses the weight there are still permanent physical impacts of having been obese as well as lasting negative habits that will forever effect the child.

EDIT: I apologize for not being able to respond to everyone’s comments, but this post blew up a lot more than I was expecting it too.

While my view on the subject is more or less the same, I have changed my stance slightly, and I would like to explain how, as well as clear up a few issues I have with the phrasing of my original post. 

1. I now believe that “neglect” is a more reasonable word for this scenario as “abuse” has far too strong of a connotation, as well as much harsher consequences.

2. My afore mentioned cut off at the age of ten was really more a soft number and one I don’t think is appropriate nor well thought out. It is now my belief that any parents of a minor are responsible for their child’s health, and that an increased level of nutritional knowledge and independence in older kids doesn’t absolve their parents of responsibility. It is a parent’s job to keep their child healthy regardless of their age.

3. I’m not advocating that we send CPS to take kids away from their parents over their weight. At most I would make it mandatory for the child and their family to speak with a nutritionist, or someone who can educate them about healthier habits. Taking a child from their family should be avoided whenever possible, and is only something I’d be in favor of if the child is in immediate danger from prolonged morbid obesity, and if the parents have made no efforts to help the child lose weight. (In my opinion in this drastic of a situation you are effectively poisoning your own child)

4. My interest is not in punishing obese children or their families. My goal is to deter parents from being complacent towards their children’s unhealthy habits, and to create a world where children are properly cared for and taught healthy habits at a young age. After all, it’s much easier to keep a child from ever becoming obese than it is to force a child to have to lose significant amounts of weight.",1

CMV: The rape and incest exceptions for abortion prohibition don't make sense unless the abortion prohibition exists primarily to punish women for pregnancy or sexual activity rather than to protect the fetus.,3990,1255,2019-05-17 01:12:14,"I think I managed to fit my narrow position in the title.  I'm not interested in whether or not abortion should be legal (though I'm pro-choice if it matters) but only discussing the rape and incest exceptions to abortion bans.

If protecting the fetus is relevant because it is seen to have some inherent value, that inherent value is not reduced because of how it came to be.  It will still develop, in time, into a human being provided it doesn't miscarry like 10-20% of most pregnancies.

However, if seen as a moral punishment of a woman for her misdeeds, this exception makes perfect sense.  A woman who willingly had sex must be forced to carry a child to term as a method of control / punishment by society, *unless* it really isn't her fault *that the sex occurred*.  This is much more consistent with the rape/incest exceptions.

I'm willing to accept that this is about societal **control** over women rather than punishment, and I won't take that as a change in my view though I'm still interested in discussion.

And primarily I'm interested to see if there's any rational for that exception to an abortion ban that leaves the ban with an internally consistent philosophy that isn't about punishing or controlling women.",1
CMV: The age to join the United States military should be the same as the drinking and smoking age (which was raised to 21 starting the summer of 2020).,3983,496,2019-12-28 02:31:17,"The argument that everyone always gives for not being able to drink at 21 is that the brain isn't fully developed yet, etc. But we allow these same people, who can't even legally purchase a beer, to go and die for us?

Yes I get that there are other positions that never see combat. But that doesn't change the fact that they CAN see combat. now, I'm not arguing that the drinking age should be lowered, or that the military age should be increased. Obviously one of those would have to happen if we made them the same age, but I'm not really for one of the other, as I am no expert. But I cannot fathom how people think it's okay to allow people to join the military, but they can't even have a beer. And soon they won't even be able to have a cigarette.

Im actually not sure what would change my view on this subject. I'm not really sure what could be said to me that wood convince me that it's okay to send somebody to potentially kill other people, but somehow drinking a beer is more detrimental to their health (or whatever other reason anybody can come up with for this law). 

however, I am open to discussion, and I am certainly open to have in my view changed.

Edit: I keep seeing the same arguments over and over, just worded differently. Nobody has changed my view, and I have to go to work. 

I just want to clarify that the entire point of my argument is that once the United States government views an individual as an adult, they should be able to make all of these decisions by themselves. If they consider 18 to be an adult, they should be able to make these decisions. the entire point of being considered an adult, is that the government recognizes that you are able to make your own decisions and take care of yourself and provide for yourself. But they don't trust you to have a drink or smoke. but of course they don't mind if you join the military, because that benefits them. and for everyone saying that drinking harms of the people, so does joining the military. Family sometimes don't get to see their children and loved ones for four or more years at a time. Not only that, but if that person dies in the military, the entire family is devastated. It may not be the same effects as drinking and driving and killing somebody on the road, but to say that the military and drinking aren't the same because drinking affect other people is asinine. joining the military absolutely affect other people in those around you. And it has a detrimental effect on plenty of people's mental health.",1

When we analyze these texts, we gain knowledge of ideas popularized *centuries* ago that are no longer applicable to today's society.

The English curriculum needs to be more applicable to a wider variety modern-day carreers such as science, engineering, law, economics, etc., as all of these (and many others) will require some type of technical writing. 

Why should high schools waste such a valuable opportunity to introduce their students to the intricacies of a skill that they will likely need for their entire lives? Isn't it so much more enjoyable and rewarding for a student to learn to articulate their *own* ideas through writing instead of summarizing those of a long-dead author from a bygone century?

CMV: Millennials have to fix the world and have every right to be angry at the older generations.,3941,987,2019-02-26 22:28:13,"Millennials have been given a huge task by older generations and the sooner they are elected to positions of power the sooner they can fix the problems that these generations have made.

 In order to fix the climate Millennials will have to travel less, consume less and pay more for the privilege. This is on top of being poorer than the generation directly above, sky rocketing costs and growing inequality, and then we have to pay even more tax just to keep the people who created this awful self serving system alive for a few more decades and give them spending money. To deal with all this and expected to respect their elders (while they write articles about how Millennials are causing all the modern problems) is a disgusting position, especially when they have had decades to actually start fixing the issues and have instead focused on getting rich.

Lets look at the ageing population issue, people are living longer and because of the baby boom there are now more of them than ever. These people were given really amazing retirement packages back when people died young. Now that governments have realised that this is unsustainable they are making pensions worse and harder to get by extending the retirement age over and over. Also they realise that the health care for this group is going to be massive, just to have enough workers to look after them we need mass immigration but it turns out that they don't like this either. So the only thing that will work is more and more public money going to health care at a higher tax rate. This burden is falling on millennials when they should have upped there own taxes invested in public health care while they were earning to be ready to look after them selves when they were old. 

Climate change is a massive problem and it has been known about for decades but instead of implementing massive recycling schemes and emission cutting in the 90s or even the early 2000s so it could change slowly over they pushed it back since they like consumption and now we only have 20 years to save the world which means huge and dramatic changes effecting the quality of life for the next 30+ years.

CMV: Making your kid pay rent to live in their own home if they’re under the age of 18 is child abuse and should be illegal,3926,373,2019-07-30 22:11:31,"I was reading a comment here about some kid whose mom made him pay rent at 16, and I genuinely can’t comprehend what kind of parent would do that. Even if your kid dropped out of high school and went into a trade, you signed up to take care of—feed, shelter, love—your child until they’re an adult. 

Even if they’re in college and living at home I have reservations about it personally, but it should be up to the homeowner at that point since the kid is technically an adult with a job probably and should be learning how to manage rent, taxes, etc. And obviously if they’re adult people with jobs still living at home the parent should feel free to charge rent. 

But I feel like forcing a 16 year old to get a job and pay you to live in their own house is ludicrous. Children aren’t an extra source of income for you, they’re a person you brought into the world voluntarily (in most cases) and it shouldn’t be on your child to provide for you. If you really want to teach them a lesson about the real world, make them do housework to help carry the load. Unless the child voluntarily gives some of their income to the parents to help out, I feel like this is at least mildly abusive. Unless someone can think of some very specific circumstance, I can’t see a good reason to allow children to pay rent to their own parents.

Quick edit; I’m out right now but I have changed my view a little, I’ll do some deltas later and respond to everyone! Thanks for helping educate me and other people on the issue!

EDIT: My view’s definitely been changed a bit. I still stand with it being regulated somewhat to protect minors, but I don’t believe it should be illegal anymore or considered child abuse. It’s been pointed out that paying some small form of “rent” can teach responsibilities and in a majority of the cases the parents put it back into the child’s future education or reimburse them to help down pay a house or apartment. 



It’s next to impossible for it to be regulated without making it straight up illegal, and parents should be able to raise their child as they see fit. Although it’s sill their duty to protect the kid and forcing them to pay or kicking them out is actually illegal already, but having them give a small part of their earnings to a college fund or something is much different. I would also say if the kid is willing to contribute or for situations where the family struggles financial that’s another, good reason. Thanks for the discussion everybody!

CMV Any society that doesn’t offer sufficient social safety net that people with even the most severe disabilities can still afford a decent life should at least offer free assisted suicide.,3905,414,2020-02-26 06:53:12,"If you’re sufficiently disabled or ill (physically or mentally) that you can’t contribute enough to some hypothetical society to earn a living wage and there isn’t sufficient social welfare to support you, you shouldn’t have to die of poverty.

To be very clear, in this hypothetical, a lack of income is a certain death sentence unless someone else is supporting you. These people are all either going to die a slow and miserable death, usually within weeks, or they can be offered a more painless option.

Some people would argue that you’re not entitled to anyone else’s labor and thus should be left to fend for yourself and, of course, die. Others would argue we can’t afford it. Others that it’s not worth it to help those people if it means some can take advantage of the system. Whatever the reason, some societies are like this.

It’s not easy and it’s often painful. I’m suggesting offering a painless and easy way out of an otherwise certainly painful and slow death.

Seriously, stop saying they should just build a social safety net. I know! I agree! But that’s not the hypothetical!

All the SATs test for is essentially English language skills and basic Math, while the other equivalent programmes test for a minimum of 6 subjects, covering more content and they are more in-depth.

Point 2: Limited Pathways for Education

I'm gonna be comparing the US system to my own home country's (Singapore). In the US, high school seems to be where the overwhelming majority of students go to, and spend 3 years preparing for SATs. After that it's college, and if you don't go to college, pretty much all you have is a high school diploma that doesn't do anything. There are few alternative pathways, and while other options like trade schools are available, I'm not sure how often they are used.

In comparison, there are many pathways in Singapore. There's a high school equivalent and trade school equivalent called polytechnics, which train people in technical skills that can be used to find a decent full-time job post-graduation, without having a degree. Options are open to students who aren't book smart.

Point 3: College is ridiculously expensive

Aside from being almost the only option for students to go post-high school, US college education is ridiculously expensive. A source I found says that on average, American students pay $30000 USD per year for college. That's about the amount I'm paying for four years of education. I would attribute this in part to the fact that college is the only option since there is a lack of options in the education system.



One aspect that I'd like to acknowledge is that the US has several of the top universities in the world, such as MIT, Harvard, Yale, and other Ivy League schools. But I think that these don't really represent the rest of the education system, and don't really prove much against the points I've thought of.",1
CMV: having no burnt popcorn is more important than popping all kernels,3883,150,2020-07-08 07:47:03,"I used to work at a cinema and they use pretty expensive machines that can do both, but even then, every once in a while someone would burn popcorn and you would literally have to put the burnt popcorn in a trash bag and walk it out of the building. It's not ridiculous either - burnt popcorn is not appetizing and adversely affected concession sales that a movie theater depends on.

All of this is to say, my wife will complain that I take the popcorn out too early (8 seconds left on the popcorn function on a microwave we tested for making popcorn) and she doesn't like sifting through kernels, but my opinion on this is:

1. You're probably not going to take the trash bag you throw the burnt popcorn into out of the house so the smell lingers.
2. The kernels filter to the bottom, so you don't really have a problem separating them while eating.
3. There's more butter for less popcorn which is better anyway.

The absolute worse outcome is that 98% of the popcorn is properly cooked and 2% is burnt and she'll eat around the burnt popcorn, so you can't escape the smell because it wasn't even thrown away. It's like playing Russian roulette with disgusting food that sometimes isn't disgusting.

For these reasons, I think the most important part of popping popcorn is not burning the popcorn while my wife disagrees. If there are some arguments I haven't thought of I'd love to hear them because I'm at a complete loss for this rationality. Please change my view.",1

CMV: You shouldn't be able to see how many upvotes/down votes a comment has until after you have upvoted/downvoted.,3872,191,2019-12-20 13:42:35,"One of the most annoying things about Reddit is how often comment sections turn into circlejerks. Echo chambers are harmful to rational discussion, and should therefore be avoided

All it takes is five people to disagree with you for a comment to be hidden and buried, which makes any comment that isn't in line with the prevailing orthodoxy effectively invisible. Having comments be hidden isn't necessarily a problem, but what is a problem is how often comments get mass downvoted just because they're being downvoted. Humans like to feel like they're on the ""right"" side, so they are extremely susceptible to group think and letting their opinions be influenced by popular trends, so when someone sees a discussion where one commenter has 20 upvotes and the other has 10 downvotes, they will be naturally predisposed to favour the upvoted comments. The problem is, of course, that you don't know how many of those upvotes/downvotes were themselves people just following the trend, so the issue just snowballs. I've seen plenty of fairly reasonable comments get downvoted into oblivion one day, and then the next day on the same sub a comment echoing the same sentiment might have hundreds of upvotes.

Psychologically, this is often a subconscious process since, while we like to feel as though we are right, we also like to imagine that we are rational free-thinkers. Therefore, I think a solution would be to have a comment's score be hidden until you vote on it, with a short time limit on altering your vote. This way, people would have to judge it independently and for its own merits, and following the crowd would have to be an active and conscious effort rather than a passive, subconscious bias. I don't think many self-respecting people would be willing to change their vote after the fact to be in line with the majority, and people are more likely to stand by their own independent thoughts when they have to actively think about whether they're letting others influence how they think.",1
CMV: White people can wear cornrows,3881,2034,2020-02-25 12:40:31,"When my sister (totally white) was 14 she went to summer camp with cornrows in her hair. She chose to do this hairstyle because her hair is very long and extremely frizzy and curly and she didn't want to have to deal with taking care of it. About a week into camp she was called out by a white camper for appropriating African-American culture and forced to take out the cornrows by a white counselor. She described the whole situation as somewhat traumatic, people calling her racist, etc. I think this is an unjust violation of her freedom of expression.

Apparently the idea that cornrows are cultural appropriation began after white celebrities wore cornrows and were described as ""exciting"", ""new"", and ""edgy"" by the media. Black women were justifiably shocked by this; after all they had been wearing cornrows for generations. But the problem here wasn't that white women were wearing cornrows, rather, it was the media's reaction that was the problem. This cultural appropriation idea needs to be treated differently and should never be extended to people like my sister, who was wearing cornrows for the same reason black people do, because they're functional for frizzy hair.

Ideally I think students should be trained and certified in CPR/first aid early in their freshman year, drilled periodically, and recertified as necessary throughout the remainder of their time in high school. This would probably take a grand total of 10-15hrs over the course of their whole four years of high school. Considering that students spend 2800-4000hrs in high school anyways, and huge swaths of that time is spent having them memorize and regurgitate information that for 98% of them has no practical real life application, spending a tiny fraction of that time teaching them some basic skills needed to keep people alive (or at very least not make medical emergencies worse) seems well worth it, and I don't know why its not already required learning.",1

CMV: anything can and should be joked about in the right context,3853,470,2018-11-20 05:36:13,"I believe that, in the right context, anything can and should be joked about. To say that some topics must never be made light of gives too much power to those things.

To say it’s never okay to joke about it is to give them and the event power over us, while making a joke out of it is the ultimate insult to Nazis and Hitler. Essentially, making a joke out of serious topics gives us power and takes away the negative power of those serious topics. 

Now, I’m not saying you should always tell jokes about serious topics. Don’t make Holocaust jokes with a survivor unless they make it clear they’re okay with it. Don’t make dead baby jokes around someone who miscarried unless they make it clear they’re okay with it.  However, if someone tries to be offended on the behalf of others but has no actual personal ties to the topic, then joke away. In that case, the offended party is in the wrong.

&#x200B;

**TLDR at bottom (it's the title)**

*For context - I live in Atlantic Canada.*

I used to love driving, couldn't afford a car when I moved out, exclusively bicycled instead for the last several years, recently got a good job, so got a carshare, and have been very surprised by how shitty driving is now that I'm an adult.

I got my license at 16 and in retrospect I am horrified that anyone let me behind the wheel at that age. The written test was a one-page piece of cake, the driving test was brief and didn't cover anything difficult (like parallel parking, merging on the highway, finding the turning lane, etc) - it boiled down to seeing if I knew what a flashing green was, and whether I remembered to check my mirrors. It's been a decade and I have not yet been required to take another driving or written test - even if several of the local laws regarding driving have been altered. Driver training isn't even mandatory - if you pay $600, you can take your (easy) tests and walk out with a license to drive after doing it exactly one time.

My city has had a string of ped/car and bike/car collisions over the last few years (and so, I'm seeing, have many other places). So many people have died or been seriously hurt, and it's being treated as a fact of life. Comments in the articles blame the victim, as if the driver was inconvenienced in any way besides having to fix a dent. I don't know the exact circumstances of these collisions, but two humans colliding at 5km/h or even two bikes colliding at 20km/h is obviously a lot less serious than anything colliding with a car. I don't think enough drivers are aware of the incredible responsibility you have when piloting a very heavy, very fast machine, and aren't aware enough of the risks of not taking it seriously. I'm seeing a lot of fatalities for ""pedestrians wearing dark clothes walking at night"" and this is often framed as their fault - when in reality, doesn't it make more sense for the person driving the vehicle to drive slowly enough to be able to stop in time in low-light conditions like nightime? If they're in the city, shouldn't they slow at every intersection, assuming an unseen person is there? Why is the onus on the pedestrian to own and remember to bring a safety vest or white tshirt each time they have to get somewhere after dark? **As car drivers, we get the benefit of fast, convenient travel - at the price of the responsibility of not hurting anyone.** I know in many situations the ped/bike was clearly at fault. This post is about the rest of the collisions.

Some ideas:

* Reduced speed limits in cities (from 50km/h to more like 30) so people have more time to see and react to situations unfolding ahead and around them. With stop signs and lights, I can't imagine metro driving times would get significantly higher.
* Heavier, more frequent fines for texting/speeding/tailgating/blasting through an active crosswalk/unsafe passing...
* Much longer and more in-depth written tests, focusing more on actual behavior than regulations like how bright your taillights should be in lumens. For example, that EVERY intersection, even if unmarked, is a crosswalk. Or that if you can't pass a bike or ped safely with at least one metre of clearance, you CANNOT legally pass. No 'sneaking by'!
* Mandatory re-taking of written test every six months, with policy updated, to keep it fresh. Allow doing this online. Make it open book. The point is to reinforce these standards.
* Much more involved and frequent mandatory driving tests. I'm talking several hours for a couple of days every year or so, in multiple road conditions (wet/dry/fog/night), in multiple situations (major highway, rural highway, rush hour in a city, turning left against traffic, safely exiting a blind drive...) and demonstrating knowledge of as many of the items in the written test as possible.

&#x200B;

I get that increased person-hours in testing etc would be expensive - perhaps steeper ticketing by automated systems for the stuff above...?

And of course I know that no one's perfect, including myself, and that this is not about perfect adherence, and more about a cultural shift and onus. I think most irresponsible drivers would become better drivers if they actually HAD to. I'm not hoping for anyone to lose their license unless they've demonstrated that they are unable or unwilling to drive safely.

I also know I don't have any real, tested proposals (this is just my experience/opinion, I'm no policymaker) and that this is getting into fantasy territory. My view stands. When thinking out this post, I realized I can't even imagine a city that isn't smoggy, noisy, and full of traffic and cars and road rage and collisions, and that scared me.

I'm not sure how this got so long, been building up for a while I guess. I cut so much of this out (I've been editing for two hours) and I'm excited to talk about it.**TLDR: My view: access to cars has become ubiquitous, and because of that, and safe driving not being a priority/enforced, many people don't take the responsibility seriously, leading to entitlement, dangerous driving, and people getting hurt.**",1
"CMV: The claim that a man is ""mansplaining"" is a convenient and sexist way for women to silence debate instead of addressing the man's arguments.",3813,1542,2017-10-05 08:42:41,"I'm willing to acknowledge that women and men are treated differently in professional and social contexts. I don't have any data on hand to back this up, but I wouldn't dispute that all else being equal, men are expected to be more assertive and may garner more attention when speaking up than women.

Despite this social phenomenon which probably exists, it is intellectually dishonest, lazy, and frankly insulting for women to disregard the opinions of men by playing the ""mansplaining"" card. 

Each individual, whether male or female, has their own personal experiences and knowledge that others do not have. If a man happens to know more than a woman about a given subject and shares his knowledge with her, is he suddenly doing something reprehensible? I certainly would not condemn a woman for explaining something to a man, so why should the reverse be problematic?

One might counter my argument by stating that ""mansplaining"" requires more than a man simply explaining something to a woman. Sure, I'd be willing to admit this. Per wikipedia: mansplaining means: ""to explain something to someone, characteristically by a man to woman, in a manner regarded as condescending or patronizing.""

The problem with using this term is that whether or not a person is being condescending or patronizing is entirely subjective. A given woman might feel that a given man is condescending, even though he may be in good faith and with no intention of coming across that way. This man may not even explain things differently to women than he does to men.

Of course, some men do treat women with greater condescension than they do men. However, even when this is the case, it is sexist to use the term ""mansplaining"" to characterize his behaviour. The problem with this term is the chilling effect that could ensue. If men now risk being condemned for explaining things to women (whether or not they are doing so in a condescending manner), these men will simply avoid explaining things to women altogether.

I think that sharing information and knowledge is something that should be fostered and valued. This certainly means that the opinions of women should be valued too. We should not attempt to silence and prevent men from sharing their insights with women. Instead, both men and women should encourage women to share their own insights and make greater efforts to value what women share when they speak.

In short, I think the term ""mansplaining"" is a juvenile way to compensate for social injustices by indiscriminately attacking all men without attempting to resolve the core of the issue. Ultimately, using this term needlessly provokes hostility and does nothing to encourage people to listen to women more. 

Edit: **The definition of mansplaining**: I see a lot of users claiming that mansplaining has one definition, namely that the man must be condescending with a woman who knows as much or more than the man about the subject matter in question. These users claim that this is the *correct* definition of the term and that the definition I have provided (a man being condescending or patronizing when explaining something to a woman) is an *incorrect* definition. I can't say that I agree with this distinction. I gather that the term mansplaining is relatively new slang (according to googletrends the term originated in February 2008). The term has since been frequently used in situations covered by both the ""correct"" and ""incorrect"" definitions. I submit that this usage is what informs the definition, since it is how the term is commonly understood. There is no reason to preclude one definition or the other.

At this point, I still feel that it's use in either context is sexist. Even if the term is *supposed* to apply only in the *correct* definition situations, using the term in those situations will only make its use in both *correct* and *incorrect* situations more widespread. The term is itself open to interpretation and sounds to any objective male or female listener like a reproach of male-to-female explanations perceived to be condescending.

CMV: Hand washing facilities should be placed outside of bathrooms rather than inside.,3798,167,2020-03-31 10:58:37,"Washing your hands after going to the toilet is obviously a good thing to do. The problem, as I see it, is that this relies on everyone washing their hands (which we know isn’t the case). If there is an inward opening door, you have to make contact with the handle which is touched by everyone else. 

Also, unless the stalls are completely sealed, it seems that fecal particles can disperse through a room, meaning that the taps(faucets) and any other surfaces are compromised. 

It makes more sense to me that we wash our hands once we leave the bathroom so that we sanitise once we no longer have to contact shared handles or objects that share a space with toilets. It would incentivise the non-washers to wash because it’s more likely the handle will be compromised if no one has washed their hands before exit. 

The ideal solution, in my opinion, would be to have hand washing facilities both inside and out as we may also use the sinks and mirrors inside the bathroom to shave, apply make up and have the option to double wash. 

I’m struggling to find any downside outside of the financial and architectural inconvenience. I don’t really think they are significant enough to prohibit this, as we accept these for other things when the inconvenience is outweighed by the benefit.

CMV: Voting Day in the USA should be a National Holiday,3794,221,2019-07-26 23:57:20,"I know this won't fix everything, and I'd even accept it being on a Saturday, but can anyone explain to me the true detriment to making the first Tuesday after November 1st a national holiday? I ask sincerely. 

I'm aware of the theories on why this isn't the case. But I'm curious....why is making this a National Holiday a BAD THING? I know not EVERY company will recognize the holiday and close their doors, but it has to be better than nothing, right? 

Keep in mind, I'm not suggesting we FORCE businesses to close up shop to allow their employees to vote, but is the fear (or concern) related to this idea grounded in money? Like not enough resources to manage voting polls, hourly workers not making money, etc?

**UPDATE**

I had to bail early yesterday before I could get back to a lot of comments, but it seems to be an interesting debate among many users here. I appreciate the responses. I genuinely submitted this post because I was curious about what the naysayers were thinking. I am no voting expert, nor an economist - but it seems the biggest drawback or argument against making voting day a national holiday is a lack of faith in the voting public or the damage it could do
either the economy, hourly workers, or small businesses. 

I for one do not want to completely ignore these concerns. I see them as valid. But I still feel we need to make it easier to vote or at LEAST try something new. Be it a week of voting, voting polls open on weekends or making it a national holiday. I know many states have different rules and regulations when it comes to voting - and this doesn't even take into account all the local and municipal referendums that fly in under the radar, but I think it would do this country some good if we could figure out a way to encourage more voter turnout. Just my two cents.

My thinking is two-fold:

* If White is called White, then Black should be Black.
* Not all Black people are American. I would assume that a Black person from another country would feel a little strange to be called AA. Thus, calling someone AA is just another convenient way of profiling.

Maybe the word ""Black"" has a history associated with discrimination? Even that, I still think it's a better term than AA because of the point about American.

Or maybe Black people appreciate that non-Black people make the effort to try and address them with a term that are perceived as more respectful? I just think that avoiding the word Black while accepting the word White is a step backward from equality.",1

CMV: Hillary Clinton's newest statement about Bernie is not helping anyone but Trump.,3773,1256,2020-01-22 21:25:10,"I hope this doesn't become some troll filled anti-Trump or pro-Trump or anti-Clinton garbage fire.  That is NOT my intent.  I'm hoping a few adults show up to this.

Hillary Clinton echoed an old statement she made that ""[nobody likes Bernie](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/21/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-2020-election-101339)"" and that he has been around for years and no one wants to work with him and she feel bad for people who got sucked in (to support him.)  

&#x200B;

I think most Democrats feel that ANY Democrat is a country mile better than reelecting Trump.  (yes, just like every Republican knows Trump is better than Hillary- that's not the point here.)  I think some Democrats who voted for Hillary did so because she was not Donald Trump.  There were also many people who stayed home because the two options were just [not worth going out to vote for](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/01/21/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-2020-election-101339). 2016 was a twenty year low turnout.  Part of this was caused by a lot of Bernie supporters refusing to vote over all the bad blood- a conversation I'm hoping not to get into again right now.

It is the easiest thing in the world- and really the only option for any person running or in a position of influence who calls themselves a Democrat to say ""I will of course support whoever emerges as the Democrat Candidate.""  At the very least just keep quiet if you feel you can not say that!  Why go out of your way like Clinton did to talk shit?  What is she getting from doing this?  Hillary is seen as a Hawk and not super progressive but she is certainly in the same ballpark as Bernie as opposed to Trump who is playing a different sport altogether.

CMV: Neo gender identities such as non-binary and genderfluid are contrived and do not hold any coherent meaning.,3771,815,2020-01-21 00:21:33,"EDIT 3: Yeah this has pretty much run its course now and I'm going to leave it here. I just wanted to do this last note at the top to summarise my thoughts at this point:

 - Some people, like me in the opening post, define gender or gender identity as inherently of the relation between your physical sex and perception of self. One thing I've gained from comments here is that what I might class as dysphoria isn't as simple as I had thought and some people have explained identifying as non-binary or something other than male/female in degrees of dysphoria or different types of it which I hadn't considered or been aware of, so that's helped my understanding of those terms from that angle.
 - Other people define and relate to gender strictly in terms of culture, social expectations and their relation to the world around them. They identify in non-binary terms because of how they deviate from or feel those norms don't apply to them. I'm still a little ""jury out"" in my mind on whether I would personally class that as a gender identity, but it's certainly been insightful in how these terms can be valid simply insofar as not everyone means the same thing when they talk about gender.
 - Another thing that came from the above was numerous contributors made reference to other cultures which include genders besides male and female in some form. To be honest, without being an expert on each and every one of those cultures, I can't really say to what extent that's relevant in the application of gender and gender identity in modern Western culture and society. I certainly take the point that it underscores how conceptions of gender can vary depending on when and where you are, but that there may be other cultures which recognise three, four or a million genders isn't really a point of contention to me or what I was asking people to ""change my view"" on, because I was specifically asking about how people use those terms here and today...I mean, unless you're saying what you mean when you identify as non-binary is the same thing the Navajo tribe mean by two-spirit so I should read up on that, I'm just not sure it really tells me much.
 - Yes, I still believe there are ""snowflakes"" in the world, people for whom these labels are nothing more than a teenage fad, or a way of claiming victimhood. But I have also learned that assuming anyone using terms like non-binary, genderfluid, femme etc. falls in to this attention-seeking category is indeed a deep misconception on my part. I was actually surprised at how little resentment, anger, offence or reactionary calling me a Nazi took place for asking these questions in what I expected to be an extremely touchy subject (I mean, it did happen, but it was very few people), but it is one I wanted to explore and understand better. The overwhelming majority of you were very friendly, sincere and I got a lot of positive understanding and human engagement out of it. Very grateful to you for that.
 - My biggest outstanding question or thought on this is I still wonder to what extent the ever growing vocabulary around not just gender but broader identity is actually helpful as sociopolitical discourse. I guess I think when you develop these increasingly specialised and numerous terms for identity characteristics, whether intentional or not you run the risk of further dividing and segregating people, boxing in their personalities to arbitrary labels and even pitting them against each in competition for recognition and resources. And yet that seems like the opposite of what you would want to happen. So yeah, well I wouldn't blanket dismiss identity politics and advocacy based around identity as universally a bad thing, I think it comes with a lot of caveats and is something you should do with caution.

Thanks to all who took part.

Gender identity in the mainstream, until a few years ago, was defined exclusively in terms of male and female (the gender binary). We also obviously had awareness of transgender people, who experience body dysphoria, an innate sense they were born as the wrong sex and in many cases, take steps to live and present as the sex they believe they should be. There are also a very small proportion of people who are clinically intersex, which depending on what form and to what degree may or may not impact whether they can be distinctly classified as male or female.

None of the above is a controversial ""change my view"" thing for me; the existence of trans people and intersex people is self evident, as is that they do not necessarily fit the distinctly male or female gender identity in which the vast majority of people fall.

More recently, however, we have seen the widespread adoption in mainstream discourse of ideas like ""non-binary"", ""genderfluid"", ""gender is a spectrum"" etc., or even that you don't need dysphoria to be trans (this last one is especially bizarre to me, as I would say being transgender by definition requires you to experience body dysphoria).

That I do not get. To me it seems like contrived attention seeking. Either it does not really mean anything coherent, or when people who espouse these views are referring to gender and gender identity, they mean something totally different by those terms than I do.

For example, if I were to say my gender identity is male, what I mean by that is the combination of the following two things:

1. I am physically, biologically male and have the corresponding physical traits to that sex.

2. There is no disconnect between my body and sense of self; no part of my body or its maleness feels ""wrong"" or like it doesn't belong to me as a self aware being.

A trans person would say there is a disconnect between their bodily traits and sense of self.

What's a ""non-binary"" person who is not intersex and distinctly, physically classifiable as either male or female expressing when they say they do not feel male or female? ""Gender"" to me in that context is the relation of your physical sex to your identity, so I don't see how it's possible to have something ""in between"".

The only answers I have ever seen make reference to tastes, personal preferences, things I would regard as personality rather than gender. I for example reject that not being a walking one dimensional 1950s stereotype of your sex somehow amounts to holding a different gender identity, nor do I see how that is even coherent as a concept. You're a young boy who likes baking cupcakes and playing with Barbie dolls? That makes you a boy who likes baking cupcakes and playing with Barbie dolls, that's all. You're a teenage girl who likes cutting your hair short, putting on a hoodie and skateboarding? Great. What's that got to do with anything we'd refer to as your gender?

So that's my ""change my view"" - explain to me what it means to say your gender identity is fluid, non binary or whatever other neologism has been coined for it and how this is not just either a conflation of gender with personality, or a bandwagon to claim a marginalised identity by people who are entirely ordinary.

EDIT: Huge thank you to everyone who's contributed, it's getting to a point now I can't keep up with or respond to all the answers. I'll keep reading what comes in, but I'm going to have to largely drop out of replying at this point, perhaps save the odd thing which particularly piques my interest.

EDIT 2: Again, thank you everyone. Some of the answers in this thread have been qualitative, useful and given me a better and wider understanding of these gender identities and gender issues. It's very clear that many people have many different conceptions and views of what gender is, how it relates to ourselves as individuals and the constituency of culture and society. While I do still believe there are people out there who co-opt certain labels and identities essentially as a form of attention seeking without any substance to it, it is also clear that to many other people these identities have real, significant meanings which speak to them in a way binary gender doesn't and which have been insightfully explained. To that extent, this post has been successful in ""changing my view"" and giving me a better understanding of other people's perceptions and experiences.

I want to finish by addressing one last point; there have been a few accusations that the title and body of my post was rude, insulting or disrespectful. I won't apologise for incidentally offending anyone when that wasn't my intention, but I will tell you that wasn't my intention. I do my best day to day in my life to be empathetic, to understand people, to learn, to grow, to challenge myself, my own judgements and perceptions by actively seeking out those of others which may be different and to reserve the right to unapologetically change my mind at any time new information or perspective convinces me I was wrong. That's what I was trying to do here. There's no point approaching that by holding back or being dishonest about what I'm thinking when I come in.",1
"CMV: Banksy's real name is Robert Del Naja, and he is the singer of Massive Attack.",3747,327,2018-10-06 21:16:22,"This is a popular theory, but I've never met anyone who knows Banksy's real identity, despite some damning evidence:

1. **Both started their careers in Bristol:** Robert Del Naja was born in Bristol and between 1983-1989, he performed with the Bristol-based band The Wild Bunch. Banksy's origin is unknown, but he started his career with freehand graffiti art as part of Bristol's DryBreadZ Crew in the 1990s.

2. **Both have similar art styles:** Robert Del Naja is a well-known visual artist who brought the stencil graffiti movement to Bristol. Banksy is an even more well-known graffiti artist who frequently uses stencils. Others have noted similarities in their art styles.

3. **Both claim to be friends with each other:** Robert Del Naja has told the Daily Mail that Banksy is a ""mate"" who has ""been to some of the [Massive Attack] gigs"". Banksy wrote the intro to Robert Del Naja's book ""3D & the Art of Massive Attack"", where he cites Robert Del Naja as an inspiration.

4. **Both have connections to Portishead's Geoff Barrow:** Geoff Barrow interned at Bristol's Coach House studio at the same time a Massive Attack album was recorded, and the two men organised a charity concert in Bristol for Tsunami Relief in 2005. George Barrow produced the entire soundtrack to Banksy's ""Exit through the Gift Shop"".

5. **New Banksy murals appear in cities where Massive Attack perform:** Journalist Craig Williams has noted at least six instances where a Banksy mural has appeared shortly before or after a Massive Attack performance in the same city, which helped spark this entire theory.

6. **In an interview, musician Goldie, who knows Robert Del Naja, accidentally calls Banksy ""Robert"" (with an awkward pause afterwards):** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKkDiTlt8Ts

CMV: Marvel re-releasing endgame with extra scenes is scummy.,3731,489,2019-06-20 15:57:18,"For context marvel is putting a new version of endgame in cinemas with pre-made scenes at the end, as well as a stan lee tribute.

This is just a push to squeeze as much money out of the viewers as they can. They already had the scenes when they finished the film, they should've either put them in or included them in the DVD. Instead they intentionally withheld them so they could try and get people to re-watch their film

Not to mention how bad it is that one of their main advertising points about this is their stan lee tribute. This is *monetised.* They are making money off of stan lee's death. They should've put it ad-free on youtube, or at the very least not used it to attract viewers

Now i've been a fan of the mcu for a while, but this is ridiculous. It's like a game company selling dlc but you need to re-buy and play the whole game before you get the dlc. It's insane.

And before you say it's just a product people want to pay to see, it's mainly that this means what was presented before wasn't the final product. It was essentially missing scenes, meaning that i paid money to see what i thought was a full movie but in reality i need to pay *again* to see the full movie

CMV: People incarcerated for marijuana related crimes in states where marijuana is now legal should be released.,3719,240,2019-08-24 01:57:33,"There are many people who are currently incarcerated due to marijuana related crimes, in states where marijuana is now legal. It doesn't seem fair to them to continue to imprison them since the crimes they are being punished for are not longer considered crimes. If they had committed the act that led to their imprisonment after legalization, they would not be in prison. Although they committed their crimes while marijuana was still illegal, if the legislature felt that this type of act should no longer be considered illegal, all those who are in prison should also be released because the acts that they are being imprisoned for are no longer considered crimes. 

This would help decompress an already overburdened prison system and seems fair to those who have been incarcerated for things that are no longer even considered crimes. 

One could argue that although it is legal now, when the act was committed, it was considered illegal and so the punishment should be based on whatever the law was at the time. This argument seems untenable because despite the act being committed at a time that it was deemed to be illegal, times change and sometimes the legislature/judiciary determines that certain laws were incorrect to begin with. As an example, if before 1967 someone was imprisoned for being in an interracial marriage, once the Supreme Court deemed these kind of laws to be unconstitutional, it would be reasonable to release anyone imprisoned for such an act. Arguing that they should be kept in prison because interracial marriage was illegal when they got married would seem a very odd argument to make. This doesn't match the values of the society as it is now and therefore these people should not remain imprisoned.",1
"CMV: In heterosexual relationships the problem isn't usually women being nags, it's men not performing emotional labor.",3718,1788,2019-07-09 21:26:58,"It's a common conception that when you marry a woman she nags and nitpicks you and expects you to change. But I don't think that's true.

I think in the vast majority of situations (There are DEFINITELY exceptions) women are asking their partners to put in the planning work for shared responsibilities and men are characterising this as 'being a nag'.

I've seen this in younger relationships where women will ask their partners to open up to them but their partners won't be willing to put the emotional work in, instead preferring to ignore that stuff. One example is with presents, with a lot of my friends I've seen women put in a lot of time, effort, energy and money into finding presents for their partners. Whereas I've often seen men who seem to ponder what on earth their girlfriend could want without ever attempting to find out.

I think this can often extend to older relationships where things like chores, child care or cooking require women to guide men through it instead of doing it without being asked. In my opinion this SHOULDN'T be required in a long-term relationship between two adults.

Furthermore, I know a lot of people will just say 'these guys are jerks'. Now I'm a lesbian so I don't have first hand experience. But from what I've seen from friends, colleagues, families and the media this is at least the case in a lot of people's relationships.

&#x200B;

Edit:  Hi everyone! This thread has honestly been an enlightening experience for me and I'm incredibly grateful for everyone who commented in this AND the AskMen thread before it got locked. I have taken away so much but the main sentiment is that someone else always being allowed to be the emotional partner in the relationship and resenting or being unkind or unsupportive about your own emotions is in fact emotional labor (or something? The concept of emotional labor has been disputed really well but I'm just using it as shorthand). Also that men don't have articles or thinkpieces to talk about this stuff because they're overwhelmingly taught to not express it. These two threads have changed SO much about how I feel in day to day life and I'm really grateful. However I do have to go to work now so though I'll still be reading consider the delta awarding portion closed!

CMV: Anyone working a full-time job should be paid enough to support themselves.,3707,1365,2019-07-14 21:52:44,"So for me the above held opinion is straight-forward common sense. What this means is that a person should be able to afford a mortgage, food, water, clothing, and anything else which would otherwise put them below the poverty line, e.g. internet connection and electricity, working only what we as society have defined as a single full-time job, typically between 45-48 hours a week.  


So why is this a CMV? Well, I've heard several people mutter that they think that someone working in service industry, as a waiter or fast-food cook, should not be entitled to that sort of life. People view these often as ""student jobs"" or ""unskilled"" as if that makes them somehow undeserving in comparison to their ""family person job"". Several organisations exist that measure the ""living wage"" - how much money people need to afford the basics depending on their area. Recently the Conservatives in the UK have rebranded the minimum wage as a ""living wage"", however they left it at a much lower rate than the independent organisations have judged to be the true living wage.  


I find this shocking, but I've heard people say that this is government interference and nanny stating to even provide this much, with people saying things like ""Oh, if they wanted to be paid more then they should get a better job!""  


My biggest problem is that what effectively happens is that businesses that are pretty much on the border of failing are having their enterprise shored up by working tax credits or benefits paid in lieu of that business actually paying it's staff - basically the business doesn't have to be successful because it exploits it's workers to the point that, despite not being profitable enough, it still maintains operations, rather than going to the wall. I feel like this is the business shirking it's social responsibility on to the tax payers, who don't benefit directly from that business' success.

So where am I wrong? Am I a bleeding heart liberal, or have I made a grave misconception? Is the only counter-argument here just that we don't enforce a minimum wage at all?",1
CMV: Diamonds are a boring gem and should not be as valuable.,3699,296,2019-12-13 20:05:56,"I fancy gems. I sub to many gem and mineral subreddits, and i think a natural gemstone can be a beautiful earthly treasure.

However, i dont like the jewelry world's fixation with diamonds. Among gems, non is as commercial as diamonds, but i just cant help but feel that its taking the soul out of the gem, making it a sparkly rock and thats it.

Here are some reasons why i dislike Diamonds: 

1) The chase for perfection- when the goal is a super clear stone, it makes stones indistinguishable.

2)diamonds arent that rare, but they are controlled by diamond companies so the market doesnt saturate. This is why they trying so hard to fight lab made diamonds. 
That beat them in the game of clearness. 




3) usually diamonds are colorless, and its boring... Some stones have insane natural colors and i think thats way more interesting. With the right cut, stones can become just wow

Some examples of stones i think are just wow:

Opals are amazing in the sense that each one is unique with distinct color play.

Sapphires come in all colors and some even have an effect called a ""star"", a naturally occuring 6 point star optical illusion.

Many more stones have that unique character that make each stone unique.

But... diamonds are marketed really hard

CMV that diamonds arent as boring

EDIT : so, some people did change my mind about diamonds being boring. Their chemical structure is indeed very unique.

And the political drama around diamonds, from blood diamonds to them being used as a black market currency and a way to launder money is definitely not boring.

I was generally really happy how big this topic got and that people are so opinionated about gems.",1
CMV: A blown break light or tail light is not a reasonable suspicion/cause for a traffic stop by a law enforcement officer.,3671,507,2020-07-04 16:08:41,"For too long law enforcement officers have been authorized to initiate a traffic stop due to a blown brake light or tail light. This is impermissible for the following reasons:

1) A blown brake light or tail light is nearly impossible for a driver to have knowledge of before driving, especially when traveling alone. (Proven by taking a drivers exam at the DMV, where the presence of a DMV employee is required to check brake lights/tail lights prior to the exam and entering the road, as one cannot physically see the rear end of their vehicle) Even worse, a brake light or tail light can blow during operation of the vehicle. 

2) There is no sufficient way for a law enforcement officer to show that a brake light is actually blown. (Other than having the driver move to the back of the vehicle and have the law enforcement officer enter the vehicle to press the break pedal, which is highly unlikely to happen due to officer safety concerns)

3) It allows for discriminatory and stereotypical pre-textual stops based off of race, ethnicity, low socioeconomic status, religion, sex, and disability.

4) It often is, and leads to, an abuse of power by law enforcement officers

Solution: A law enforcement officer must be required to take down the make, model, and license plate of the car in order for an agency (such as the DMV) to send out a letter by mail or email to notify the registered owner(s) of the blown brake light or tail light. They could also be required to telephone the registered owner(s) to speak with them at a later time or leave a voicemail if still driving. Not only will this lessen discrimination, stereotyping, and abuse of powers by law enforcement officers, it will allow resources to be utilized for necessary and more important crime. It also comes down to discretion of the officer. Not all situations require a traffic stop, while some very well might (snowstorms, both tail lights blown, dual functioning tail lights and blinkers, etc.)

This could also be applied to a blown headlight, however, a blown headlight is a bit easier to identify by the driver. For instance, at nighttime it can be noticeable to a driver, or, it can be noticeable in the reflection of a vehicle traveling ahead of the driver.

Does anyone else have thoughts or opinions on this matter?",1
"CMV: Today's FBI press conference shows without question that Hillary Clinton is above the law and is not being held to the same standards as less connected, powerful and rich Americans would be.",3660,768,2016-07-06 00:49:37,"Today's FBI press conference explicitly states (among other things) that Hillary Clinton would not be charged with a criminal offence because she was not aware she was breaking the law. Awareness of the law is not generally required to convict someone from a crime and the only reason she has gotten away with it is because she is too powerful and well connected for members of law enforcement to risk their careers going after her. On top of this, her position in government would have explicitly made her aware of the seriousness of these offences and the consequences of not respecting the sensitive nature of the information she had access to. Finally, a lesser employee who committed these acts would be fired and never work in government again for such obvious mishandling of this information. Therefore, it is my opinion that Hilary Clinton has very clearly today been shown to be not subject to the same regulations as a less well connected, powerful and rich american and by extension the citizens of america do not live in a nation where rule of law can be expected to protect the common man from government corruption.

CMV: The normalisation of social anxiety is breeding social anxiety,3654,222,2020-04-04 12:04:34,"*EDIT: I must clarify that I do not believe this is the ONLY cause of the rise in anxiety. Obviously, as with almost every issue faced by the world, there are MANY factors that affect global mental health*

To start, I have OCD and panic disorder. I do not suffer from anxiety, however, I’d say I understand feeling anxious, and suffering from a mental illness more than the average neurotypical person. I’m not trying to ridicule anyone with social anxiety or any forms of anxiety disorder. I am NOT saying that normalisation is inherently bad.

Social anxiety is a very real very valid mental illness. People would most certainly still suffer from social anxiety regardless of if we had a label for it/ if people were vocal about their experiences. 

However, I believe there is a reason social anxiety seems to be the most common form of anxiety, particularly in the current rising generations. We talk about it non-stop. Social anxiety has been normalised to the point where it’s considered ‘not relatable’ if you don’t have it.  

Check out any form of social media and you will find comments making jokes about how they’re ‘too scared to order food’ or ‘too scared to answer calls’.  YouTube skits, Instagram memes, tweets and such are centred around this, it has become embedded into the culture. I would like to state social media at this point, for this rising generation (16-25) is clearly a given for each individual person to have and use to communicate effectively. Therefor it is not a sampling of only introverted/anxious people, but the general population. 

I believe the constant rehashing of social anxiety and the issues associated with it are bringing unfounded fears to the forefront of people’s minds. They hear flocks of people say things such as “I’m too scared to order my food, what if the waiter judges me.” &amp; They in turn think “Oh, I’ve never thought of that. Will the waiter judge me? Should I be thinking about that?” And rinse &amp; repeat with several social anxiety issues, until these fears are imbedded in the whole populous.

There has to be a reason that social anxiety seems to be growing so rapidly when other forms of anxiety are not. To me it seems clear that is due to the normalisation of it.

I suffer from panic attacks over a fear of being killed (among many other things). The fear of terrorism (planes) and general apocalypse level things is a common trigger for me. I logically understand these are unfounded fears. When I hear a particularly loud plane overhead and start freaking out, I remind myself of this (that it is my mental illness causing this fear, that I am not in danger it’s just an imbalance of chemicals in my brain bla bla bla), and instruct others to do so as well if they wish to help me. It doesn’t always stop a panic attack, but it certainly seems to shorten them or give me a sense of hope that they will be over soon, it’s just my brain messing up.

When someone is socially anxious, there’s seems to be a culture of ‘understanding’ their anxiety. Like it is integral to make them feel supported and understood. One must say “I understand why you might feel this way, it is very scary to talk to the person at the cash register. I’m here for you.” Or alternatively, “I’ll do it for you.” This seems like it almost takes their fears and in some way makes them reality for everyone around them. Like instead of blaming social anxiety on an illness, it’s an accepted response to the world we live in. It seems like this normalisation of the response to anxiety could be making these fears seem logical in the minds of people who otherwise wouldn’t of thought to fear some forms of socialisation.

I want to make it clear. I am NOT saying we shouldn’t comfort people with social anxiety or do any of the above. I am NOT saying we should treat people with social anxiety that way that helps me. I suffer with a different illness, I am a different person. Things are different. 

I am simply saying the reason the way we handle social anxiety right now is making it more likely for other people to develop the illness, because it’s embedding it into our culture as a norm, instead of as a serious illness that needs assistance. I think this could cause a lot of troubles in even neurotypical people, and could be changing the scape of what is a ‘normal’ fear. 

Maybe there is no other way to handle social anxiety; maybe there is. I’m no expert. 

I just think neurotypical people should be on the look out to remember social anxiety is an illness, and the worries of the mentally ill don’t have to be adopted by you, work hard to resist the temptation that fear has on all of us; I suppose. 

Idk, do you think social anxiety rates are stagnant, maybe this is all anecdotal evidence? Change my view.

*Edit: wording ‘growing’ ‘stagnant’*

*Edit: OCD is not a form of anxiety as of 2014 as per the DSM. Please stop telling me it is in the comments. Regardless, I was referring to GAD (Generalised Anxiety Disorder) which is widely recognised as manifesting completely differently to OCD, even before they separated OCD and Anxiety officially.*

**Edit: I think I’ve slight changed my view? I don’t believe it’s the normalisation of the ILLNESS that cause it’s growth, more likely the normalisation of unhealthy coping mechanisms (avoiding socialisation etc) that has spread to people who otherwise wouldn’t of found it socially acceptable to indulge in those behaviours. I don’t think social anxiety is treated enough as a serious debilitating illness (like depression and OCD are) so people refrain from highlighting how absolutely dangerous it is to use those unhealthy coping mechanisms. Instead we just get memes about being to scared to answer the phone. Imagine if we were to get similar memes about cutting? It would be a stark difference.**

**And that’s not to say there’s anything WRONG with joking about mental illness, I think it’s important. But it’s only a viable option if it is first taken seriously, which social anxiety is not. I’d like social anxiety similar to agoraphobia which is taken MUCH more seriously, but no one sees the avoidance of ever leaving the house as something to joke about instead of help someone get over.**",1

[The average hourly wage in the US is $28.32.](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t19.htm) At that rate you earn a penny every 1.3 seconds. Even at a rather low wage of $12 an hour, you still make a penny within 3 seconds. Now imagine you're digging for a penny in your wallet or purse. That could easily take three seconds. But don’t forget that the cashier is waiting for you fumbling through your wallet. Between the two of you, that's six seconds. Now imagine you're with your spouse and there is a couple waiting in line. Between all five people, you fumbling for that penny has wasted all of 15 seconds. Based on the average hourly income that comes out to almost 12 cents worth of time wasted for the sake of one cent. (Note: I’ve been a cashier and I’ve waited full three minutes at a stretch for people to find and count their pennies.) 

Simply put, the penny no longer serves its  basic purpose as a method to store and transfer wealth. We should get rid of it and round to the nearest nickel at the register. 

Am I missing some value provided by the penny?",1
"CMV: Employers that make no effort to retain employees (through promotions, raises, etc.) have no room to complain about turnover.",3650,143,2019-04-26 06:14:55,"My last employer was a shitshow. They relied a lot on temporary agency associates to help get the workload done; while's it no secret that temp workers have a high turnover, even the permanent employees left really quickly as well. All told, the turnover rate at my last employer was in the triple digits.

I was a permanent employee of this company for a year before leaving for a much better job. When the HR manager found out I was leaving, she sighed and asked, ""Why are all of my good people leaving?"" I wanted to smack her right then and there. Why? Because months earlier, before I had received this job offer, I was discussing my dissatisfaction with this same HR manager, and she sighed wistfully and said, ""I don't know what to do. We don't really have a lot of opportunities for people to move up.""

This company paid its permanent employees $11-12 per hour. There were never any raises and few opportunities to advance. And even when higher-level opportunities did come up, they were always hired from outside. I've since come to realize that far too many employers are like this.

The only real benefit offered to employees at this company seemed to be a tuition assistance program. However, it didn't come with any kind of promise that the education it supported could be used in the company, which basically meant the company was taking money and setting fire to it.

I suppose I need to get to my point now. If you are an employer, and you want dedicated employees, you need to offer some combination of the following:

*Chances for employees to get trained in different roles (especially ones that are better-paying).
*Regular raises
*Stock options
*Valuable compensation plans

Now, I'm sure I'm going to hear someone say, ""What if an employer can't afford all of that?"" If an employer can't invest in their employees, then I'd wonder why they're hiring in the first place. But at a minimum, regardless of their financial status, if they refuse to invest in their workers, they don't have room to complain about high turnover.",1
CMV: Piracy is fine if it is the only way to access that material.,3644,732,2018-11-18 18:53:31," 

Quite some time ago one of my favourite podcasts released a vinyl episode that was only available for a very limited time, and now there is no way to get it but to listen to a pirated version on youtube. I believe that it is fine to do this, because it is the only way for me to listen to that episode.

Another possible example is pirating media that isn't available in the country you live in, which would make it inaccesible to you. Say you own a video game console, but a game you would like to play, isn't published in your country, and isn't available as a digital download. I think it is also fine to pirate media in this situation.

So, change my view.",1
CMV: Media outlets sharing exit polls hurts democracy.,3645,225,2018-11-05 21:31:31,"My opinion: Media outlets that share poll results, especially exit polls, during any stage of voting (i.e. early voting or on election night) hampers democracy.  Broadcasting exit poll results harms democracy by demoralizing those whose candidates or parties are polling behind, and by incentivizing laziness or inaction in those whose candidates or parties are polling ahead.

For both groups, the introduction of this impartial information can have a chilling effect on democracy, and the practice should be more heavily regulated.",1
"CMV: LGBT-only schools are not a step in the right direction; they will not help tackle discrimination, only create a sense of ""otherness""",3633,267,2015-01-26 18:50:55,"A charity here in the UK called *LGBT Youth North West* believes that a state-run school for LGBTQ students is possible within three years, and that this is a positive thing for students who identify in anyway as being non-heterosexual. They are taking the Harvey Milk School in New York as a model.

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/plans-drawn-up-for-britains-first-lesbian-and-gay-school-9981822.html

http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/if-the-price-of-saving-gay-children-from-bullying-is-to-ghettoise-them-then-so-be-it-9984396.html

I believe this will not be truly in the best interest for gay or lesbian students, for a variety of reasons. If I were gay, and growing up in a deeply homophobic environment as student under the age of 16, I can't see how this would be to my benefit.  

* Completely understandable with the desire to have a safe environment for gay students, but is this not actually yielding to homophobic attitudes? Instead of tackling bullying culture, gay students are effectively segregated from other students for a time, the bullies got what they wanted. And when the bullies grow up and enter the workforce, they are only likely to ever carry over their prejudices and discriminatory attitudes. They need to be told that this isn't acceptable, and people of different sexualities aren't ""others"", but their own peers as well. Even though enrolment is purely voluntarily and temporarily, we should be concentrating on integration rather than enforcing our social differences, and stamping out intolerance. 

* ~~The example given as justification for the school; the case of a 14 year-old girl from a Christian family, who killed herself over guilt of being attracted to women. Elizabeth Lowe was afraid of coming out to her parents and friends. It is not clear, how exactly if this school existed, would it made it any easier for her to ""come out"" to her family. If a gay student can't admit this part of their life to their parents, how can they be able to ask to be enrolled in that school?~~

* I've known plenty of LGBTQ people, they aren't immune from having deeply homophobic attitudes themselves. It is a view also held by some gay people that ""bisexuality"" is simply ""indecisiveness"", that ""queer"" is a buzzword, and transsexuality isn't necessarily wholly accepted by all either. There are preconceptions and ideals as to how a ""gay man"" should act like, and expectations for lesbians from other lesbians as well (""lipstick lesbian"", ""dykes"" etc). If the objective was to ""take sexuality out of the classroom"", I can only see this as failing, because they can't ensure freedom from discrimination, even between themselves.

"CMV: Black Panther was not the ""black power"" movie everyone says it was",3633,497,2018-12-06 00:55:28,"What I mean by the title is that although it was the first Marvel movie with a majority black cast, etc., the portrayal of Wakanda was actually quite backwards. Although Wakanda has incredibly advanced technology, their system of government is laughable. It is an absolute monarchy, where a fight to the death chooses the next monarch. Unelected heads of tribes serve as the king's advisors. No society with technology as advanced as Wakanda would still have this system of government, and if anything it reinforces the stereotype of African countries as tribal, backwards and primitive. I believe that if Black Panther was actually interested in portraying Wakanda as an advanced country, it would at least be a democracy or similar. In fact, the extent of the fallibility of this system is demonstrated when Killmonger bests T'Challa in combat and is then able to make the unilateral decision to supply weapons to rebels across the world, against the wishes of most of his advisers.",1

If for some reason the gun posed some safety risk, because of a faulty mechanism, then I might understand, but to me this is as ludicrous as the victim of a hit and run suing the car manufacturer.

CMV: Not quoting your sources in an article generating revenues should be illegal.,3603,174,2020-04-10 21:41:25,"EDIT : It's my first time on CMV and I did not expect that post to gain so much traction ! It's very hard for me to stay engaged in so many conversations, so I'll probaby read and answer only if I really want to.

I've had interesting discussions so far, and my view has indeed changed. Thank you !

Disclaimer : english mistakes will be made (?)

I think we should all be able to check every single ressource that leads to the creation of ANY publication generating revenue to the publisher. There should be a complete bibliography at the end of every news article, on the same model as scientific publications. No one should be able to make money out of unbacked sources.

   I am amazed at the number of bloggers and even newspaper explaining, summarizing facts they gathered without giving the reader any chance to confirm it by himself. I think it is deceptive and extremely dangerous, as it helps rumors and fake news spread.

Even in famous newspapers, there are several instances where instead of original sources there are  just links leading to other newspaper articles, so you have to trust that ""because it appears in a famous newspaper, it must be true"". Even though these newspaper are doing incredible work and are probably 99% accurate, it also incites the public not to dig deeper, and this is that very inertia and lack of education that makes such a fertile soil for gossip and misinformation to develop.

This is why I think this should be made illegal, and considered as a minor offense.",1
"CMV: Electoral/Party funding should be exclusively public, big private donations shouldn't be allowed",3609,722,2020-04-26 08:14:49,"I'll start by saying that regardless of what country you're from, democracy is or should be your most valued principle. If it is your most important principle, it should be fair and you should protect it at all costs. 

However, we also live in a society where money talks. The biggest parties have the most money, this is pretty much an universal rule at all countries. 

Private funding/donations (my biggest issue being corporate funding or millionaire donations by a single person. I'm ok with your average citizen donating 5, 10  15 bucks or whatever to whoever he wants to support. Lets all agree that isnt the same thing as millionares donating 5, 10 or 15 million dollars) leads to elected oficials ""owing"" favors to the ones who donated. This makes their ""donation"" being pretty much an ""exchange"" or just legal bribery. You donating 15 bucks however, wouldnt be the case.Any leftover funds from donations? Well, make them go into the next election's fund. 


Now as to what i believe is the actual polemic view, remove the party funds. Each election, recognized parties (no, you and 5 friends cant just create a party and receive this funding) will receive the same amount of funding (i dont have numbers, but if it turns out high, so be it, democracy should be protected). 
This would make it easier for smaller parties with different opinions to reach more people and in turn, get more votes. Also would make it harder for parties like the republicans or democrats to get votes simply for being ""blue"" or ""red"". Ever wondered how an election with smaller parties having an actual shot? This would make a better democracy, as more views could be exposed for voting, making it more diverse and representative.

"CMV: The war on drugs is one of the worlds worst policy decisions, does more harm than good and is ultimately pointless.",3598,300,2019-11-06 04:23:00,"I know its not a controversial opinion but i want to see the other sides point of view.

The war on drugs is one of the worst policy decisions in the countries that enforce them, has led to a myriad of problems for society and is in direct opposition to the fundamental idea of liberty and the right to individual self-determination. These problems include:

# Increase in crime

The war on drugs is primarily enforced by the prosecution of individuals who are engaged in the Production, sale, distribution, sale, possession, and use of drugs. This automatically increases the number of people the government defines as criminals, who in my opinion should not be considered criminals. Since drugs are illegal, there exists a black market for them. Since there is a black market for drugs, the people who would be business owners in a legitimate market now have to exist outside the law. In order for drug dealers, suppliers and cartels to handle market disputes, they have to do it outside the legal framework. This forces drug dealer and suppliers to resort to violence and murder in order to maintain their business. This happens to any lucrative and unregulated/under-regulated business (see the South African taxi wars). 

The war on drugs also leads users who are caught with drugs to make their money in ways other than work if they have a criminal record, as they cannot find work in the legitimate economy.

# Criminalization of a mental/public health issue

Drug addiction is a public health issue and people who are addicted to drugs are not criminals, but often people who are suffering from mental health problems and self-medicate using drugs. In my opinion, the way you help people with mental health problems is not by arresting them and putting them in prison, but by giving them support and medical attention. The war on drugs has made it more difficult for drug addicts to seek help, has stigmatized their condition, and criminalized their drug use; making it more difficult for them to improve their quality of life and  often keeps them from being able to escape the cycle of drug use and addiction. I do not think this is the best approach for mental health disorders that lead to substance abuse, and is not only reducing the quality of life for drug addicts, but actively preventing them from getting better.

# Violation of essential liberty

The war on drugs invades the essential liberty of all of us by stopping individuals from exercising our right to do what we want with our own bodies. Every individual should have the right to self-determination, and should be allowed the freedom to do anything to their body, even if it is harmful to their health. It is not a crime to cut yourself, drink alcohol or smoke, eat unhealthy food and become obese, or have unprotected sex. Therefore it shouldn't be a crime if you use a dangerous drug, as long as the only person that is negatively effected is you. 

# Stunting scientific research

The war on drugs makes it incredibly difficult for any scientific researcher or institution to research drugs and how they interact with the human body. since the brain is built on chemical signalling, the best way to see how the brain works is to see the effects of chemical on the brain. even through the limited research that has been conducted, so much information on how the brain works has been learnt, which can lead to better innovations in medicine and medical technology. beyond that, many of these illegal drugs have legitimate medical uses, from medical cannabis, to the psychedelic amphetamine DOI having anti-inflammatory effects, drug assisted psychotherapy (MDMA for PTSD, Psilocybin for depression and end of life anxiety), and ibogaine (schedule 1 in the USA) not only being used to help opiod addiction but also for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

# Making drugs more dangerous

Because drugs are a prohibitive market, there is no regulation. as such drug dealers are not held to any legal responsibility for the purity or safety of the drugs they supply. This is the main cause of the opiod overdose crisis in america. Using opiods as an example, the most dangerous side effects of intravenous opiod use are caused by prohibition. Medically, opiods can be used safely to treat pain, and when used in a safe and ideal way, they cause very few side effects (not including addiction which is a mental condition and not a physical one), and the damage to the body is minimal. Because heroin is illegal, the alteration and misrepresentation of heroin is economically incentivized and has tainted the US heroin supply with fentanyl, which is too potent to be dosed accurately, leading to overdose. As well as that, the war on drugs has made it more difficult for intravenous drug users to obtain clean needles, making the sharing of needles more common which increases the chance of infection as well as the spread of diseases that are transmitted through bodily fluids (such as HIV). The criminalization of drug users has made users more hesitant to call an ambulance in the event of overdoses for fear of being arrested for possession of drugs. This is just one example.

# The War on Drugs is pointless

These issues would not matter as much if the war on drugs actually worked, however, the basic economic law of supply and demand (as well as the inherent nature of drugs), means that prohibition will never solve the issue, but lead to an endless game of cat and mouse between drug dealers/supplier/cartels and law enforcement. even despite some of the harsh penalties for drugs, the use of drugs has not decreased, and all they have led to is suffering for drug addicts, restrictions to scientific research, and the handing over of a lucrative market to criminals.

Even though this is my opinion, i want to understand why people are in opposition to the legalization of drugs, so if you're for the war of drugs and opposed for legalization, tell me why.",1
"CMV: Committees in the House and Senate Should be Run by Actual Scientists, Economists, and Experts",3590,281,2020-01-09 07:06:44,"We see in several committees that politicians run them, not experts in said field. At times, these politicians may not even have any knowledge, a lack of knowledge, or have agendas that hurt whatever committee they're in. Some of them have no idea what they're talking about. For example,  Lamar Smith was a Republican who was a chairman in the Committee of Science, Space, and Technology. He had a very anti-science approach and did not believe in climate change, and tried to suppress climate scientists.

Because of this, these committees should be run by actual experts. Like the committee of science should be run by scientists. The cybersecurity subcommittee should be run by cybersecurity experts. The Armed Services committee should be run by those who served in the armed services. 

Politicians won't be able to run these committees, even if they were an expert in the field. But they can advise the current experts in the committee. This is to prevent corruption. This way, we won't have politicians denying climate change and being a chairman in the committee of science.",1
CMV: Religious beliefs are essentially opinions and should not be given more weight than any other type of belief or opinion.,3568,311,2017-02-04 05:26:53,"In the US, there are various exceptions and accommodations for religious beliefs. For instance, Catholic hospitals do not have to directly provide birth control and can instead sign a waiver with the actual birth control being supplied by a third party.

The Trump Administration is currently considering granting additional protections, and there are many conservatives who support the position that religious business owners should not have to serve gay couples, for instance.

I see two objections to this, one practical and one more philosophical:

* If applied to other characteristics of individuals, such as race for example, we would immediately say that people do not have the ""religious freedom"" to deny service to black Americans on the basis of race. Such a view would be widely condemned as racist and hearkens back to the days of Jim Crow.
* Religious beliefs are simply beliefs, and in a pluralistic society it does not make sense to continually grant exceptions to laws based on one category of beliefs without granting exceptions based on all categories. If anyone, for any reason, could say ""I do not want to serve gay individuals at my restaurant"", that would be one thing. But the policies being discussed grant that right-of-denial based only on religious beliefs.

I find these ""religious freedom"" policies to be thinly-veiled attempts at discrimination, but I also realize many Americans genuinely disagree with me. I'm hoping you can change my view and convince me that religious beliefs are indeed worthy of types of protections that beliefs justified in others ways are not. 

EDIT: This was a really great discussion, thanks everyone. Great first experience with CMV. I partially changed my view, based on recognizing that religious beliefs belong to an institution in addition to a person, and that religion itself has been around for a long time and has some pretty stable qualities that we all recognize. I still would like religious and non-religious beliefs to be treated equally, but I get that in certain circumstances it can make sense to take a religious belief seriously while skepticism can exist about a similar non-religious belief.

CMV: Wireless charging is a useless fad,3566,849,2018-11-24 02:03:55,"What even is the point of wireless charging?
When I first heard about it, I thought it allowed you to charge while having more freedom with your phone. But then I learned what it actually was. It's more restrictive than an actual charger, and its slower. Not to mention wireless charges sometimes don't work if the back is metal. 
It only makes things less convenient. 

How did people hype such a thing so much? I understand if it was something that could charge your phone without you directly putting on it, and if the range had the potential to increase over time. But it's just a charging port that you can't move around. ",1

From the left it's ""It's not my job to educate you"" and from the right it's ""Go do your own research, I did mine.""

The whole point of activism is to enact change. That won't happen unless you get people on your side when they go to the voting booth, and that won't happen if you won't tell them what your point of view even is or why they should support your cause. 

If you're not going to try to further a movement, you should go home because you're in the way of the people actually doing the educating and doing the research you're too lazy to do. You actually turn people away because when someone asks why they should support your cause and you tell them it's not your job, they walk away thinking you're an incompetent hack and you just lost a potential supporter.

CMV: Keeping psychedelics illegal only holds back research and doesn't actually help any of the causes the prohibition claims to.,3546,206,2019-10-10 01:35:41,"First of all I'd just like to state the fact that I think a lot of this problem stems from how broad and problematic the word ""drugs"" is. It refers to everything from coffee to heroin, mushrooms to tylenol and I'm pretty sure most people agree that is too broad of a category to comfortably make blanket statements about. Understanding this a lot of people break things up into ""good drugs"" and ""bad drugs"" which is also completely useless because it always comes down to the person and the context. A bit of mushrooms in a therapy session might be great for a terminal patient suffering from end of life anxiety, but it might be horrible for someone with schizophrenia, just like how sedatives might be good for certain people going into surgery but not for a depressed teenager with addiction problems. My point with this is that it's all relative and contextual.

Psychedelics refer to a specific subset of psychoactive compounds; most commonly LSD, Psilocybin mushrooms, DMT, etc. While MDMA is not technically a classic psychedelic I will include it in the argument (as most people do) because of the massive amount of research coming out on its therapeutic effects, similarities to psychedelic experiences and despite all this, its status as a schedule 1 drug. Now I understand that despite the racist origins of drug prohibition in the west a lot of these policies are in place today not because of intentional malevolence but rather a continuing momentum from the past coupled with fear and a misguided attempt to keep everyone safe by prohibiting what you've been programmed to perceive as dangerous. That being said it doesn't excuse the fact that the prohibition is not only keeping us from learning about an area of psychopharmacology which we already struggle to understand but it's holding back research that could lead to breakthrough therapy capable of helping countless people, therefor taking medicine out of the hands of people that desperately need it.

Now I'm not saying we should lift all prohibitive policy and fully legalise every psychoactive substance but what I am saying is that I don't believe it helps anyone having an all around ban on any substance, making it illegal regardless of circumstance. I would argue a large percentage of drugs that are illegal across the board have some sort of context in which their use makes sense. Even methamphetamine, a drug that's dangers are widely known to most people is a schedule 2 substance under the understanding that there are certain medical/therapeutic implementations for it. So if we all understand how destructive methamphetamine can be yet we understand that it has its place, how does it make any sense to place psychedelics in schedule 1 even if there are possible dangers attached? Even if you believe these substances are harmful and should have no place in society, shouldn't we at least allow research into these substances to better understand them? 

So if were being optimistic about the reasons they are illegal it would be because there isn't sufficient research, they are possibly dangerous, and keeping them illegal keeps them out of the hands of people who could possibly ruin their lives with them. However psychedelics being illegal is the main reason there is a lack of research, the lack of research contributes to the possible dangers involved in taking them and prohibition only creates a black market which doesnt stop anyone from doing them but just opens the door for research chemicals that are actually dangerous. So how does sitting in ignorance of the subject help anybody?

Anyway that's my rant, I feel like this is a pretty solid perspective but before committing it to belief I'd like to be as discerning as possible in finding holes in the idea using the help of you fine redditors. I'm honestly open to whatever people have to say on the subject so please, change my view :)",1
"CMV: Using race as a factor in U.S. college admissions is, under all circumstances, wrong.",3545,937,2019-03-25 13:06:53,"As a minority, albeit one who gets the shit end of the stick when it comes to college admissions (Indian), this is something that I have had a lot of trouble coming to a conclusion on.

It's hard to be a minority. Really, really hard. This is something I am unwilling to debate, and will not change my mind on this matter. I have suffered a great deal of racism and prejudice in my life just because I look different than most people, even if I'm not considered by admissions officers as ""aggrieved"" enough to deserve a leg up. Because of this, I know what it's like to face discrimination as a person of color.

But two wrongs do not make a right. Dr. Martin Luther King dreamed of a country where his children would not be judged ""by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character"". This is what I believe America should stand for, whether it comes to pursuing job opportunities, making use of the financial system, and, also, applying to college. This, in my opinion, is non-negotiable, regardless of any ""good"" that this could have on society.

And this is precisely why I have been so conflicted on this matter. Affirmative action has done a lot to benefit African Americans, Latino Americans, and women in this country. And having a diverse set of people on campus certainly has its benefits. I am willing to acknowledge both of these. But with all of the admissions scandals that have come to light in the last few months, as well as the ongoing lawsuit against Harvard, I am beginning to lose my sense of compliance with the system.

Take this for example. An admissions officer at Harvard made the following note on an Asian-American applicant: ""Oh, typical Asian student. Wants to be a doctor. Nothing special here."" And then these people turn around and say ""oh, we take all aspects of an applicant's profile into account"". They are lying through their teeth. Shame on that officer. I am sick of seeing so many of my friends and family face so much discrimination due to something that is out of their control. We work so hard in life to succeed, yet we are punished for being ourselves. It's time to draw a line in the sand.

My viewpoint is as follows. Under no circumstances, whatsoever, should colleges take race into account when choosing to or not to admit a student. Nothing should compromise racial discrimination when it comes to college admissions. If this negatively affects other minorities, tough shit. If this decreases the racial diversity of college campuses, tough shit. If this means that college campuses will be filled with a bunch of ""typical Asians that want to be doctors"", fucking deal with it.

Please, someone, give me a convincing argument to think otherwise.

* Eliminating legacy admissions: I'm with this 100%. Statistically, it might even completely solve the problem without anyone suffering discrimination, even white people. This, in my view, is probably the best solution right now.
* Making up for centuries of discrimination: Doesn't matter. The people in the present did not contribute to the wrongdoings of their ancestors. It's difficult because the people that need to be held accountable are dead, but this doesn't mean we discriminate back against people who weren't even born yet.
* Why Asians outperform other races: Has almost nothing to do with culture, and mostly everything to do with immigration patterns.
* Affirmative action levels the playing field: So does abolishing legacy admissions. So does improving public education. So does getting rid of gerrymandering and racist zoning laws. There are plenty of ways to solve a complex problem, so a lack of creativity is no excuse for injustice.
* It’s not about disadvantaging Asians, it’s about giving an advantage: college admissions is a zero sum game, since there are a limited number of seats. This means that you can’t lift one group up without disadvantaging another.
* It's okay to disadvantage some people because they still benefit from their ancestors' actions: No it's not. It's not their fault.

EDIT 2: You have changed my mind. Kudos to [Andoverian](https://www.reddit.com/user/Andoverian) and [photobummer](https://www.reddit.com/user/photobummer) for the ""proof by contradiction"". Good job.

A bit more about my background, first of all. I'm a grad student in Electrical Engineering that's taken plenty of machine learning and artificial intelligence classes. One of the things that we talk about a lot is that AI, while it seems like it would be more impartial than humans, is not. It is completely dependent on data collected by humans, and humans are biased. In fact, they're even worse than humans, since for the most part they lack the capacity to have self-awareness that humans do.

I mentioned this in one of the comments below, and the ones that I just shouted out pointed out that this is precisely the reason why we need affirmative action. Because humans are biased, and bias needs to be monitored. This really connects the question at hand with something that I've spent a lot of time studying, which is why this realization has hit me so hard. Perhaps I'm blaming the wrong mechanism. After all, **what I'm really angry about is that Asian and Indian Americans are being discriminated against**. But this is happening because affirmative action is being used against us, not for us. I believe that affirmative action should be used to remind admissions officers that it's not okay to reject an Indian student on as blatantly shallow of a basis of ""being a typical Indian"".

Here's my revised thesis: **Affirmative action itself is not the problem - it's that it is not being used to combat biases against Asians and Indians.**

Thank you to every single one of you who contributed. I've responded to many of you as I could the past day, and have given deltas to those who gave arguments that genuinely gave me an interesting, unique, and convincing perspective, but I am going to leave this case to rest for now. I'm still passionate about discrimination and how it plays out with affirmative action, and perhaps someday I'll make another CMV regarding how Asians and Indians are treated in college admissions. Until then, though, I'm happy that we were all able to have this discussion.",1
CMV: All classified govt material should be unclassified after 100 years,3534,281,2018-10-26 20:20:49,"I believe that transparency is a hugely important thing for the govt of a civil society. One of the things that protects bad actors is the ability to hide their misdeeds from the public. Different justifications are used - most along the lines of ""national security"". But I believe the knowledge that 50 or 75 years after their death, the legacy of officials might be marred by corrupt or illegal acts being revealed would cause more bad behavior to be avoided than ""good"" (but necessary?) behavior might be discouraged.

So I believe that **ALL** classified, confidential, top-secret, etc (regardless of whatever of level of secrecy) material should be declassified once it becomes 100 years old. 

Most people I've said this to tend to agree with me. There are only three arguments I've heard that even try to argue against it:

1. That the grandchildren of an award winning hero may be traumatized to learn that it was actually a cover and their ancestor actually died due to friendly fire, a procedural error, or some other less-than-honorable manner. 

2. That knowing that history would eventually see all their deeds would cause officials to make ""safe"" or ""nice"" or ""passive"" decisions when sometimes ""dangerous"" or ""mean"" or ""aggressive"" actions are absolutely necessary. 

3. That learning of some horrific act done 100 years ago by completely different people and a completely different govt would *still* inspire acts of violent retaliation by individuals or even state actors today.


What will NOT change my mind: 
 - 1 is entirely unconvincing to me. While I would feel sympathy for someone learning that a powerful motivating family narrative was a fabrication to cover something ... dirty ... I still think declassifying everything after 100 years is of much greater benefit to society than that cost.
 - Examples of public officials choosing, due to contemporary public pressure, a ""passive"" decision rather than a ""aggressive"" decision resulting in negative consequences

Ways to change my mind: 
- Demonstrate with historical examples how #2 or #3 has happened with significant negative consequence
- Provide me with a different, convincing argument - demonstrating negative consequences from exposure of 100 year old classified material - apart from those I've listed above

"CMV: Transpeople should disclose that they're trans to their partners before acts of intimacy, e.g. sex, kissing, cuddling, etc.",3522,1593,2020-02-01 22:54:45,"First off, it's perfectly fine that transpeople exist; they're well within their rights to do so and should be allowed to express that right without any harassment. These are human beings and they should be allowed to do with themselves as they please. Transpeople should be respected just like any human being.

It's also okay to respect people's desires, or lack thereof, of sleeping with transpeople. Just like it's okay to respect a muslim's decision to not eat haram meat, or a jew only wanting to eat kosher food. I simply used these examples because they came to the top of my head; they're incidentally religious.

If a transperson isn't sure if a cis person would be okay with doing something intimate with a transperson, the transperson should be encouraged to disclose the fact that they're transgender/transsexual (sorry, not fully sure what term to use there).

It's okay to be trans; it's also okay to not want to sleep with a transperson.

I just want to emphasize, it's okay to be trans. Sorry if that sounds patronizing or condescending, but I want to make sure I don't convey any feeling of transphobia.

CMV: America is not raising a generation of pussies. Rather we're raising people who are more considerate and sensitive to others' feelings and that's a result of a naturally improving society.,3518,847,2019-03-14 14:02:14,"I'm seeing a very strong sentiment, in especially those who lean conservative (but not necessarily) that we're rasing a nation of pussies.  

""We"" are raising a nation of pussies because we're elevating the standards for decency and politeness and further limiting adversarial remarks that are considered ""socially acceptable"", and those whom we are raising are pussies because they expect these newly elevated levels of decency, politeness, and considerateness.  We learn that phrases which we thought are harmless, can actually be very hurtful to a demographic of people.  For example, calling things ""retarded"".  I'm guilty of this myself, and I used to use that as slang a lot growing up, but I've been rightfully corrected by people who said that it's offensive to people who actually suffer from mental retardation.  So we evolve our language to find more classy ways of expression.

I see this a lot on YouTube and to a slightly lesser extent on Reddit where crass and insulting phrases, or things like trash-talking in sports are defended, with a false virtue of ""not being a pussy"", and that if you're offended by such things, you are one.  

Frankly, if that's what being a pussy means, I'm okay with being one.  But I still think it's a cop-out and a clever way to deflect away conversation from the question at heart: are these things unnecessarily and overly hurtful, and does society improve from eventually doing away with such statements being socially accepted?  One must recognize that this has been a naturally evolving process.  Over the course of human history, all sorts of barbaric and cruel practices were accepted, until those came along who questioned the necessity, morals, and ethics of such practices.  You bet they were similarly reacted to in their times too.  It's likely that their fellow critics thought they were ""pussies"" too.

I believe that society will naturally continue to evolve to be more and more civilized, inclusive, and sensitive to people's feelings, and it should, because it increases our quality of life.

CMV: Elon’s new CyberTruck is awesome and a bold move toward breaking traditional design molds,3514,806,2019-11-24 01:18:04,"In a world full of generic and antiquated design, I think that bold explorations into alternative forms is something rarely celebrated, but should be. 

Is the new Tesla truck ugly? That depends on perspective. But regardless of whether it’s appealing to someone or another, one thing is clear: it’s *different*. Different is good. Different brings new innovation. Different challenges us to move beyond comfort zones into uncharted territories. 

By making a truck design like this, Elon is challenging us to throw out old conceptions of how vehicles have looked, forcing us to think different. 

Regardless of whether we *individually* like the look of the truck, I feel that that type of bold design will only encourage future designers to move beyond previous models in search of new forms that will shape future conceptions of travel. 

What do you think? Am I looking too far in to this? Change my view.",1
CMV: Telling a man not to comment on how they feel about abortion at all is an example of telling men to bottle up how they feel and contributes to toxic masculinity,3518,619,2018-12-25 06:39:59,"For many in the rural U.S., abortion is a controversial (sometimes religious sometimes not) religious issue. Many feel that because a fetus can think/learn while in the womb (1), and that because nothing happens-neurologically speaking-at birth (1) a fetus is akin to or just like a baby.

Men are constantly told not to speak about abortion, not to vote based on abortion, and not to voice their own concerns when an abortion is considered. Pro-choice media and academia often state it is obvious why men shouldn't be speaking-its her body, it's her choice-implicitly denying that a fetus is akin to a baby in the immediate. Entire anonymous forums have been set up to deal with the issue of men speaking their mind about partners having an abortion for this reason. (2)

The shame society tends to inflict on men who do speak or vote from the standpoint that a fetus is just like a baby is therefore unaddressed by academia in general and pro-choice movements. This contributes to toxic masculinity in all the fairly well-known ways, by forcing men to be quiet or be shamed for speaking up, men have every incentive not to speak and instead to take out their emotions in non-productive ways. (3)

Because such men feel a fetus is alive in the same way a baby is alive, the feelings of loss are like that of losing a baby. A monumental loss I can't even begin to imagine, and hope I never will.

To change part of my view, show that men can have their emotions addressed in productive ways by pro-choice media without any bottling-up in the situation where a man does not believe an abortion takes a life.

To fully change my view, show that men who believe abortion does take a life can still deal with their feelings about abortion in productive ways-without being told to bottle it up because they are men and men can't have a say about a womens body. I honestly think changing my view fully is impossible.

Remember, I am not arguing for or against abortion. I am pointing out the impact of current discourse of abortion on men specifically.

I know women also have a difficult time talking about having a specific abortion, but I don't think women have a difficult time stating their opinion on abortion in general. That is beside the point, unless there is some specific way it can address men not bottling up emotions.

So come on, CMV!

Edit: It has been pointed out that I don't know if the type of pressure I describe occurs more or less often than an absence of pressure. If someone could find a definitive answer, that would be great. All I have for now is this Vice article which shows an implicit silence of men in medical studies, and six men who support the right to choose who felt silenced. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/mv5794/abortion-affects-men-too

Further, my view has changed slightly. I can't edit the title, but I don't think it's toxic masculinity, but merely toxic.

2nd Edit: Here is why the Vice article felt pertinent, but not definitive: ""We don’t want to talk about abortions, so women who have experienced them are discouraged from speaking about it. Men are never even asked—at least, not usually—so we asked some... 'The experience was very much about bottling something up. But the knowledge of it was really upsetting to me for a very long time. Emotionally, I think it's much harder on the guy than people are aware.'

This concern was echoed by all six interviewees. For more than a few, our conversations marked the first time they’d spoken to someone about the experience who wasn’t their partner or close friend. They all said they didn’t really talk about it with friends or family, at the time or after.""

3rd Edit: Geez this blew up overnight. I'll try to read through them all, but any and all insults will be reported. Let's be civil, I'm honestly trying to be. Thanks.

CMV: Grass is dumb,3513,501,2018-05-18 22:21:49,"For all its ubiquity, grass is a useless, pointless plant, whose upkeep is a complete waste of time

I just don't get the hype, guys.

All the average lawn does is grow, get trimmed, and get sprayed. The nutrients in the dirt, which could be used for other things \(i.e. food, prettier plants, trees\) is being wasted on this dumb green thing which obligates me to sweat every week for no reason other than seeking conformity to a culturally mandated home aesthetic.

CMV. Why shouldn't I just use my entire lawn to grow vegetables/fruit instead?

Edit: The CMV is in the context of work for the homeowner. My lawn isn't a park

Edit 2: Yes, I do have to mow my lawn, or else suffer a fine. HOAs and City Ordinances are a common thing mandating this",1
"CMV: Circumcision is completely unnecessary, has arguably zero health benefits, and removes the ability for glide motion that makes intercourse significantly more comfortable. Religious reasons for the practice are irrelevant. It is genital mutilation done without consent and is indefensible.",3500,1411,2020-04-23 06:20:59,"To be clear we are discussing infant circumcision.

(If a grown man wants a circumcision done - go for it - it's your penis)

Lets cover the two main legitimate health concern points often made:

1. Circumcision helps reduce the spread of STD's.Lets assume this is true - the extend that it is true is debatable but lets give it *some* merit.Proper sex education alone has a FAR greater impact on the spread of STD's than circumcision. Given that there exist this more effective practice - deciding instead to mutilate genitals has no merit..
2. Smegma - everybody runs to this and it makes NO sense at all. Do you take a shower each day? Do you wash your penis?  If yes - you have ZERO smegma - ever.  Women have far more folds and crevices for smegma to form than a man with foreskin and you don't hear about it. Why? Because personal hygiene - that's why? Take a shower each day and it doesn't exist.

.I admit I have no expectation that my view could be changed but I'm open to listen and genuinely curious how anyone can defend the practice. Ethically I feel that religious motivations have no place in the discussion but feel free to explain how your religion justifies cutting off the foreskin and how you feel about that. I'm curious about that too. If anything could change my view it may, ironically, be this.

I currently feel that depriving an individual of a functioning part of their sexual organs without consent is deeply unethical.

*EDIT:  I accept that there are rare medical necessities - I thought that those would not become the focus as we all know the heated topic revolves around* ***voluntary cosmetic or religious practice****. But to the extent that many many comments chime in on this ""I had to have it for X reason"" - I hear you and no judgement, you needed it or maybe a trait ran in your family that your parents were genuinely concerned about.*   
*My post lacked the proper choice of words - and to that extent I'll will gladly accept that my view has been changed and that without specifying cosmetic as the main subject - the post is technically wrong.  It's been enlightening to hear so many perspectives. I feel no different about non necessary procedures - I still find it barbaric and unethical but my view now contains a much deeper spectrum of understanding than it did. So thank you all.* ",1
CMV: There should be a mandatory critical thinking and debate class taught at some point in primary and secondary education,3502,247,2020-10-18 04:08:07,"I took a critical thinking class in college and it taught me so much about how to evaluate arguments and positions and think of different ways to approach problems, as well as developed my empathy sensors. Also, learning about how to spot fallacies was a super fun part of the class and is really helpful in arguing.


Now I think that college was a little too late to even have a class like that and I had wished that through elementary school, middle school, AND high school that I had been continuously exposed to this so I can keep my mental swords sharp.


I see way too many people nowadays believing in the first things that they see without evaluating whether it is actually true or an acceptable argument or whatnot and I really cannot think of a downside to having this as a class taught at every level of public education. 


Just for clarification, I am mainly talking about the US since I don’t know what Europe’s public ed curriculum usually consists of.


EDIT: It seems like a lot of people are commenting about the dissatisfaction of debating classes. I’ve never taken a debate class so I don’t know what it entails but I just thought about it as in the realm of not speech and debate / competitive debating but rather just HOW to effectively argue with someone and learning about things like the Code of Intellectual Conduct. Lots of good discussion though surprised this got so much traction.",1
"CMV: Chanting ""send her back"" in response to an American citizen expressing her political views is unequivocally racist.",3496,1245,2019-12-16 09:15:12,"Edit: [An article about the event](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/17/trump-rally-send-her-back-ilhan-omar)

There's this weird thing that keeps happening and I can't really figure out why: people are saying things they know will be perceived by others racist and then are fighting vociferously to claim that it is not racist.

Taking the title event, a fundamental bedrock of American society is the right to express political views.

Ergo, there could be no possible explanation aside from racism for urgings of deportation of an American citizen as the response to an undesirable political view. 

My view that chanting ""send her back"" to an American citizen is unequivocally racist could conceivably be changed, but it definitely would be by examples of similar deportation exhortations having previously been publicly uttered against a non-minority public figure, especially for having expressed political views.",1
CMV: The “customer is always right” is a toxic business philosophy that breeds selfishness and entitlement,3490,301,2020-01-26 02:18:43,"Having recently worked a temp job as a cashier, I came to best witness to the classic “the customer is always right” business ideology in action. In short, we seemingly bend over backwards (with a smile on our faces no less) to accommodate whatever the customer needs. We force cashiers to endure the mental fatigue of checking out 100+ people in a row during rush so the customer has to wait as little as possible. 

We cave on most requests with even the slightest pushback. For instance, not having your discount card physically or any real proof (“I forgot it”). It’s store policy to deny the discount without proof of having the membership, yet all they have to do is insist and management will make an exception.

These are only a couple of examples. To me, there is little positive outcomes associated with this mindset that the customer isn’t wrong. I get wanting to provide fast and friendly service, but for the sake of both parties that can’t always be fully accommodated. And the weirdest part for me is most customers are empathetic and understanding. Most are like “oh, no worries about the wait. You guys are busy after all”. It’s only a select few assholes we seemingly tailor the business experience for.",1
CMV: High prices on emergency medical treatment should be considered price gouging,3488,323,2020-01-08 00:26:37," 

I was listening to a podcast about the high price of air ambulances. The couple being interviewed for the episode had been severely injured in a car accident, and they had to be airlifted to the hospital. The wife was airlifted by a one helicopter and received a bill for $1,700. The husband was airlifted by a different helicopter and received a bill for $13,000.

[https://www.npr.org/2020/01/03/793389441/the-skyrocketing-cost-of-air-ambulances](https://www.npr.org/2020/01/03/793389441/the-skyrocketing-cost-of-air-ambulances)  


Normal laws of supply and demand do not exist when a person is having a medical emergency as the person does not have a meaningful choice to decline the necessary treatment. The same is true for someone who needs life-saving drugs like insulin or HIV treatment.

By ""high pricing"" I mean more than needed to maintain a modest profit and stay in business. An acceptable price is one that, all things equal, is just high enough to incentivize the provider to keep offering the product or service. In the above example, the helicopter that charged $1,700 was making enough to stay in business so the $13,000 price was clearly excessive.

In the US, price gouging laws apply only to areas in a temporary state of emergency. I'm not arguing whether or not price gouging laws are good policy in general, but rather that **given the existing framework of protections for individuals who live in areas in a state of emergency, the same framework should be applied to individuals in a personal state of medical emergency.**",1
"CMV: Capitalism is not an inherently evil economic system. It is subject to excesses and abuse like any other system, but is no better or worse than others.",3473,1016,2020-02-17 03:11:27,"According to Wikipedia, capitalism is:

“...an economic system. In it the government plays a secondary role. People and companies make most of the decisions, and own most of the property. Goods are usually made by companies and sold for profit. The means of production are largely or entirely privately owned (by individuals or companies) and operated for profit.”

Under the purest definition of capitalism, individuals are encouraged to own property, to create products and businesses, and to work for their own benefit - whether as a solopreneur or a part of a larger corporation. 

Capitalism isn’t a zero-sum game: just because I gain some profit doesn’t mean I’m taking away from someone else, unless I create a product that draws customers away from a competitor. Even then, the competition is free to catch up or to surpass me in market share, or to grow the share of available market. 

Granted, there are excesses under capitalism - IMHO its due to greed run amok. But all other forms of economic systems can also be corrupted by greed and illegal activities. But there is nothing that makes capitalism any worse than any other form of economic system.",1
"CMV: Being ""apolitical"" is intellectual laziness and not a trait to be proud of",3457,378,2018-07-27 02:32:43,"Out of all places on the political spectrum, the most infuriating one is those who claim they ""don't care about politics"" for whatever reason. ""All politicians are bad"" just for example. No adult should be proud of this stance. 

This isn't some kind of enlightenment those concerned with politics have simply failed to have. This is how every child in middle school and under thinks. This is intellectual sloth and a resignation to being a passenger to life. Like it or not, politics directly affect each and every one of us. 

I don't expect people to stress over the political climate day in and out, no one has time for that. But staying informed and participating in discourse is crucial to progress

CMV: Buying a brand new car is a huge financial mistake for most people,3447,562,2019-12-27 02:47:24,"I have an old Ford Taurus with about 265000 miles on it. I’ve been looking into buying a new car because it’s likely only a matter of time before something goes wrong with my car and the repair cost isn’t worth it. However, I’ve been arguing with my parents about whether I should buy a new or used car. I’ve always felt like the premium you pay to drive the first 50,000 miles of a new car is insane. Certain kinds of maintenance at higher mileages are inevitable and buying a new car just means you’re pushing those costs further down the road — but you do ultimately need to pay them anyway. 

The only points I can really think of in favor of buying a brand new car are that you don’t know how well a used car has been maintained before buying it — regular oil changes, coolant flushes, etc. — and that used car loans have higher interest rates. Even still I don’t see how paying thousands of dollars more for a new car is worth avoiding those issues. Having a new car is a luxury, but I don’t believe it’s a financially sound decision to make, and is mostly wasteful spending.",1
CMV: Lolicon is a form of pedophilia and shouldn’t be treated like it’s normal.,3443,773,2019-11-28 00:40:56,"I’m not saying we should persecute those who view it or enjoy it - but acting as if it’s a normal thing that should be encouraged in otherwise healthy individuals isn’t something I agree with. I could make this longer but my gist is this:

It doesn’t matter if the lore says it’s 1,000 years old. It doesn’t matter if they’re based on a real person whom is of legal age. Liking someone sexually based on their childlike appearance is, at a minimum, pedophilia adjacent.

For reference, I’m a mid 20s woman that is often mistaken for 15 or younger. People that age often hit on me and so do men much older - my actual age doesn’t take away from the fact that these people are interested because of how I look as well as the young characteristics I possess. Hell, I’ve even had boyfriends whom were heavily into Lolicon and admitted it to be a facet of why they liked me. I don’t think they’re bad people - I’m glad they choose people that can satisfy their desires while remaining perfectly legal.

It does squeak me out anyway, though.

Edit: a few things I want to clarify before I start sending out more replies:

1. Pedophilia is not having sex or molesting or raping kids. Pedophilia is STRICTLY the attraction to those whom are prepubescent. It does not denote any actions.

2. As such, I do not believe anyone who simply is a pedophilia should be persecuted at all.",1
CMV: Better funding for education is the most assured way to combat many issues in society,3439,301,2019-09-24 02:32:25,"Climate Change, viruses, social inequality, if we don’t have the resources or ideas to solve these issues now, then we should be preparing a citizenry that is better educated, one that knows how to better gather resources and solve issues. We need mass education initiatives to be strongly funded.

Some argue that throwing money at educational institutions and departments won’t solve education issues because ultimately what we have is a mismanagement of funds. I agree that there is some mismanagement of funds (as someone who has seen it first hand) and that we need to think of ways to solve this issue as well, but the more institutions have at their disposal, the more that will inevitably make its way into improving education. And who’s to say that it wouldn’t also result in administrations that better know how to manage money? It just seems to me that no matter how you look at these situations, education is at the center or foundation of making long term progress on many issues.

Edit: So because of some of the comments, I do have to modify my position. Ultimately, what I am concerned with is our attitude toward education as a society and the political actions we take because of that attitude. I do want education to be better funded and think it could fix some of the issue we complain about, but the reality is that probably won't happen until out perspectives about education change. 

Also to clarify, yes, I really think that certain things should be taught in school  and I'm unabashed about that at this point. I do agree with scientists and academics on any issue I take the time to study, so I think we should teach that, and I don't think parents, in an ideal world, should have the right to deny their child that information. Also, I think teaching students *how* to think will lead them to those conclusions themselves anyway, and again, parents shouldn't be allowed to deny their parents this type of education. It does seem to me that facts have a liberal bias; overall though many groups of people, including liberals, have their issues, and we'd be better off if we could agree on what experts agree on. That being said, I am not in as much fear about what giving educational institutions more power would do as someone who is apart of this group and think those who want to spin some conspiracy are doing so with a bad understanding of epistemology or in bad faith, so your chances of convincing me that my colleagues and I have some type of nefarious agenda to make a bunch of robots like us or some other such non-sense are very low.",1
CMV: violently attacking Trump supporters or stealing MAGA hats is 100% inexcusable and makes you look like an idiot.,3424,2083,2019-05-08 19:06:13,"I would like to begin with stating I do not particularly like President Trump. His personality is abhorrent, but policy wise he does some things I dont like and others I'm fine with. Ultimately I dont care about Trump nearly as much as other do.

Recently a tweet has emerged where people where honored for snatching MAGA hats from the heads of 4 tourists and stomping them on the ground. Turns out these people where North-Korean defects, and they live in South-Korea providing aid for those less fortunate. They simply had MAGA hats because they support what trump is doing in relations to NK. The way Americans treated them is disgusting and honestly really embarrassing.

In other recent news, people have been legitamatly assaulted, wounded, and hospitalized because people who didnt agree with their *political opinion* decided to harm them. Why cant we all just come together and be less polarized?

For the sake of my own humanity I hope nobody disagrees. But maybe somebody has some really good examples, evidence, viewpoints, etc. That justify these actions to an extent?? If so many people ""like"" this type of treatment of others there has to be some sort of logical explanation.",1
CMV: Reddit has made the Platinum and Gold awards useless and now there’s no point in awarding them,3422,104,2020-03-10 13:12:34,"I was thinking about posting a challenge on r/GoForGold and using Platinum as the reward when I realized how much of a ripoff it is. Platinum gives you a month of Reddit Premium and 700 coins for the price of 1800 coins. Gold on the other hand gives you a week of Reddit Premium and 100 coins for 500 coins. But by adding awards such the It’s Cute and Fierce awards which are 250 coins each and have the same benefits as Gold, Reddit has essentially undermined both Gold and Platinum. If you award 4 It’s Cute awards and 2 Coin gifts the person who receives them gets 1 month of premium and 900 coins and you only pay 1600 coins in total. Similarly if you give someone 7 It’s Cute awards they get 7 weeks of premium and 700 coins. Either way both you and the recipient get screwed over as the recipient doesn’t get as many benefits as they could’ve possibly gotten from getting gilded and you just waste your coins instead being able to get the best bang for your buck by either gilding as many people as possible or by giving the recipient of your awards as many benefits of the award as possible.

"CMV: The current Chinese government is fascist and the antithesis of progress, and its actions are close to on par with nazi germany.",3417,737,2019-12-31 04:12:11,"
EDIT: You can probably guessed which post changed my view (hint: it’s the one with all the awards). The view I expressed in this post has changed, so please stop responding to it directly. Thank you to everyone (who was civilized and not rude) who responded. 



I live in the united states and grew up holding enlightenment values as a very important part of my life. I believe in the right of the people to rule themselfes and that every person, no matter their attributes, is entitled to the rights laid out in the bill of rights. I have been keeping up with the hong kong protests, and I watched john olivers episode on china which mentioned the ughers. I now see china, and the CCP, as not only fascist, but on par with nazi germany. It is unnaceptable to allow such a deplorable government to exist.  I consider their treatment of ughers as genocide, and their supression of hong kong as activily fighting free speech and democracy. While I disagree with trumps trade war, I do agree with the mindset of an anti-china foerign policy. With its supression of the people and its genocidal acts, I cant help but see china as the succesor to totalitarian nazi governments. Change my view, if you can.

CMV: People who can't afford kids shouldn't have them.,3421,804,2019-04-17 23:53:29,"I've seen this sentiment expressed from time to time and quite to my surprise it often generates a lot of anger and controversy. Why? According to the USDA it costs around $230,000 to raise a *single* kid from 0 to 18, and that figure doesn't even include college. That figure averages out to a little over $1,000/mo. 

*EDIT 4: I brought up these figures more to highlight the so far practically unargued point that having kids is expensive. As several people have pointed out, using the $230,000 figure is a bit misleading because that's just an average (some would say over inflated) for a certain category of people in one country; some kids will take less to raise, some will take more. So to kind of move away from a specific number I'd rather frame this issue in a series of questions. Questions like: can you afford to feed your child three meals a day? Will you be able to afford to house and clothe your child? Will you be able to cover healthcare costs when you child is sick, injured, or just needs routine check-ups? Will you be able to pay for some baseline extracurricular activities for your child so they can grow up to be a functional and well rounded adult? Will you be able to be present as a parent for your child or will you be too busy working three jobs? If the answer is ""no"" to these sorts of questions, that's what I'd define as not being able to afford children, not a specific $/mo.*

If, say, it was possible to engage in an 18 year lease agreement (one it's almost impossible to get out of) for a quarter of a million dollar car, costing the driver $1,000/mo for almost two decades, it would be a totally common sense and uncontroversial thing to say that people who cant afford that lease, particularly poorer and struggling people, should not enter that agreement, much less two, three, four, five + seperate agreements at $230,000 a pop. If someone is broke and struggling but also was leasing an Aston Martin and a Lamborghini, youd probably think they were making very poor financial decisions. But swap out that luxury vehicle with a child or three and suddenly people get upset when you suggest they're making poor decisions. Why? If anything, I'd think that it'd be better for poor people to pay for the car than the kid - having a kid, even beyond the sheer cost, makes your already struggling life even harder arbitrarily, and also worsens the quality of life for the child i.e. another human being; a luxury vehicle isn't going to wake you up crying every night, or your job doesnt have to be structured around what time the car gets out of daycare; the child's quality of life, in terms of health, academics, enjoyment, etc. is obviously lessened by having parents who cant actually properly afford their existence. 

And then, because (rightly) we dont want children to suffer unduly or die due to their parents irresponsible procreation choices, society has to step in and help foot the bill for their wellbeing. I'm not opposed to this happening, but it is worth noting it wouldnt generally even have to be a thing if people who cant afford kids didnt have them. 

**Also I'm not advocating for any kind of mandate, ban, or law. I just think it's a shitty financial decision. I think the same of a lot of financial decisions, but for whatever reason it seems there is pushback when these poor financial decisions pertain to children... I've never seen someone get up in arms over the suggestion that people who are struggling and poor probably shouldn't invest in bad timeshare contracts or whatever.** *(EDIT 6 was bolding this for emphasis - several people have responded like this paragraph didn't exist)*

Y'all know what to do. Cheers.

*EDIT 1: Should also note I'm viewing this subject through a lens of a concurrent, developed nation, particularly the US, which is where I live. Obviously in other parts of the world $230,000 could be enough to raise a thousand kids.*

*EDIT 2: We are currently experiencing higher than normal response volume. Your reply is important to us. Please be patient and a certified OP will be with you as soon as possible.*

*EDIT 3: One delta awarded so far for someone pointing out the utility and practicality of having children to stave off a low birth rate which is vital for a strong and functioning economy. My view was very much focused on individual choice and I hadn't considered societal need.*

*EDIT 5: Many people are bringing up that I ought to be more focused on creating a society where everyone who wants kids can afford them, and people have access to the education/birth control aspects of family planning. I don't disagree with those goals at all. BUT, until we create that society, if we ever do, we ought to be wise about the decisions we make in the current system, which is the gist of the OP.*

*EDIT 6: Frankly I'm not going to be able to get to all these replies, but there seem to be plenty of people chiming in from both sides of this issue, so hopefully this discussion will continue! I'll keep at this until my laptop battery dies (currently at 52%) and then I'm calling it quits for at least a few hours. Thanks to everyone for the good conversation so far.*",1
"CMV: ""Cancel culture"" and changing cartoon characters is mostly a way for white people to virtue signal/be ""saviors""",3417,214,2020-07-05 01:07:04,"1) The FSU Seminoles and the Chicago Blackhawks have *specific permission* from those tribes to use those names - yet they constantly get badgered by people not even in those tribes to change the name and that it's racist. I am referring to those two teams specifically, because they have that permission from tribal council - if those tribes allow it, who are we to tell them to change it?

2) I understand that it is extremely hard for POC voice actors to break into the profession. However, that needs to be reminded by new character being created & cast, not white voice actors being pushed out a job they've held for years to not get ""cancelled."" The majority of people who were calling for the man who voiced Cleveland to step down were white. I also understand that

On that note, I believe that we need to defer to POC/minorities when a certain character is in question - Speedy Gonzales is a good example. White people pushed for his removal while Mexicans and Mexican-Americans protested for him to stay! It's not for us, people who are not in that community, to decide whether a character is good or bad. The creator of Ghost in the Shell LOVED the casting of Scarlett Johansson - which was accurate anyway because the robot that the main character resides in is outwardly European - casting an Asian woman would've been inaccurate to the story. But who complained? White Americans!

3) Dragging videos/tweets/etc made years or even a decade plus ago by famous people or influencers does nothing and implies that society as a whole refuses to forgive such transgressions and that there's no reason to try and strive to be better because it won't be believed anyway - especially when they've already apologized for it and there's no other instances of such behavior recently. Jenna marbles got bullied off of YouTube for videos she made almost a DECADE ago and had already apologized for, and there were no other questionable videos since then. What, then, is the point of dredging it up years later?

I feel the same with issues involving cultural appropriation - I constantly see white people putting down other white people for *appreciating* a culture I stead of appropriating it, when POC aren't even complaining about that specific issue - did the Polynesian people care that little white girls wanted to be Moana for Halloween, or did WHITE PEOPLE care so they could look enlightened?

In conclusion, I understand that, as we have privilege, we need to use our voices to help POC and minorities. But I believe there are two main issues:

- We end up talking OVER them and trying to tell them what they should be offended by, which implies they're not intelligent enough to decide by themselves/is incredibly infantilizing.

- We pull years old tweets and attack influencers and celebrities while refusing to believe that they have changed in the years since and also see that behavior as problematic now in an attempt to virtue signal and act like a good person.

I just really don't think that this is the way to legitimately help POC - obviously if they also agree there is an issue that's not the case, but I also think that problematic behavior from the past should be forgiven if that person has worked to become better - but we refuse to believe that it's not a publicity stunt when they do.",1
CMV: A negative paternity test should exclude a man from paying child support and any money paid should be returned unless there was a legal adoption.,3410,1350,2016-09-02 18:35:57,"There have been many cases I've read recently where men are forced to pay support, or jailed for not paying support to children proven not to be theirs. This is either because the woman put a man's name on the forms to receive assistance and he didn't get the notification and it's too late to fight it, or a man had a cheating wife and she had a child by her lover.

I believe this is wrong and should be ended. It is unjust to force someone to pay for a child that isn't theirs unless they were in the know to begin with and a legal adoption took place. To that end I believe a negative DNA test should be enough to end any child support obligation and that all paid funds should be returned by the fraudulent mother. As for monetary support of the child that would then be upon the mother to either support the child herself or take the biological father to court to enforce his responsibility.

This came up in a group conversation and I was told it was wrong and cruel to women but the other party could not elaborate on how or why. I'm looking for the other side of this coin.

cmv: The concept of cultural appropriation is fundamentally flawed,3410,643,2020-04-30 19:21:16,"From ancient Greeks, to Roman, to Byzantine civilisation; every single culture on earth represents an evolution and mixing of cultures that have gone before. 

This social and cultural evolution is irrepressible. Why then this current vogue to say “this is stolen from my culture- that’s appropriation- you can’t do/say/wear that”? The accuser, whoever they may be, has themselves borrowed from possibly hundreds of predecessors to arrive at their own culture.

Aren’t we getting too restrictive and small minded instead of considering the broad arc of history? Change my view please!

Edit: The title should really read “the concept that cultural appropriation is a moral injustice is fundamentally flawed”.",1
CMV: Tipping as a practice should be done away with and restaurants should instead pay their workers a living wage,3404,927,2019-05-31 04:55:16,"A lot of restaurants, as you may know especially if you’ve worked in the service sector, do not pay their employees minimum wage. Instead, they rely on tipshares to make up for whatever they are not paying their employees. This is effective in keeping costs lower than they would typically be, but it seems like a failed practice elsewhere. Some people just don’t tip, or don’t know how to tip appropriately. Servers are under a lot more pressure and stress than they might be if they knew they would have a guaranteed steady wage. Overall, it’s a strange practice and I think it’s ineffective.

Some of the arguments against this are that it keeps prices lower, but hypothetically you’re just adding what you would normally pay as a tip onto the price of a meal. The amount you spend won’t necessarily change (given that you’re tipping properly). Another is that servers will be further incentivized to give good service if they are being tipped, but restaurant work shouldn’t be different that types of work where you’re not being tipped; if you’re a good employee, your performance should be good. The level of service you provide won’t necessarily change because you aren’t dependent on tips. I think the levels of stress and duress would also be lower, and the atmosphere of working in a restaurant would be far more pleasant without that added pressure. I think, overall, abolishing the practice of tipping seems the most efficient and logical thing to do.",1
"CMV: The lack of affordable education is one of if not the greatest impediment to social mobility, and the privatization of education is the culprit",3393,429,2019-08-02 01:41:15,"Edit: in case it wasn’t clear, I meant that formal education is unaffordable. I am aware that we can learn things online for free but I can’t get into most jobs without the accreditation from a formal education

EDIT2: I agree that government backed student loans are the reason that tuition fees have skyrocketed. It doesn’t change the fact that the majority of these loans are being paid to for-profit institutions. From Wikipedia: The schools with the highest amount of student loan debt are University of Phoenix, Walden University, Nova Southeastern University, Capella University, and Strayer University. [9] Except for Nova Southeastern, they are all proprietary (profit-making) universities.
——————————

Why are students forced to buy the latest edition of $500 textbooks? Why are colleges allowed to keep on raising tuition fees? How did student loans become a trillion dollar problem in America?

Children born to a poor family and can not afford a college education will likely remain poor. Even children from middle class families who graduate are stuck with a student loan that will severely hinder their financial independence. 

The whole situation just seems asinine to me. Tuition fees keeps inflating because the student loan amounts will always meet it. Get this: approximately 60% of college attendees in America borrow money to get through college. 

Among many other issues, there are two that I believe contribute the most to the problem of social mobility:

1) Education being too expensive for the poor 

2) Lack of quality employment opportunities for those without an education

In other words, the poor are doomed to remain poor.

"CMV Children under 7 have no right to be in a fancy restaurant or bar, and these places have every right to ban them if they choose to do so.",3395,518,2018-05-11 15:47:17,"There seems to be a lot of controversy around this topic.

-

Recently, there have been some news floating around about various restaurants and bars that have been tired of young children disrupting the area (e.g, children screaming, running around, babies crying etc). I know that babies can't control much so it's up to parents to not being them to places such as fancy restaurants and bars where people pay not only for the food, but the experience as well.

-

Now, the opposite of the argument is that this is 'discrimination'. Some parents advocate that they teach thier children to be respectful. Also, on an episode of 'What would you do?' everyone seemed ok with the small child crying at the fancy restaurant.

-

So what's your view? As a parent, do you feel like you are being discriminated against or do you feel like this is not a problem to be worried about? As someone who isn't a parent? Do you feel like it's the right thing to ban children? Or do you not mind at all?",1
CMV: Honey compliments peanut butter on sandwiches much better than jelly,3379,342,2019-12-12 20:27:09,"Reasons I think I’m right:

The natural sweetness of the honey is miles ahead of the added sugar taste of most jellies. 
The texture of most jellies is unpleasant when combined with peanut butter.
Jelly often overpowers peanut butter with its strong, pungent taste.

Reason I think I might be wrong:

You often have to put extra peanut butter on the sandwich to stop the honey from soaking into the bread and stiffening the bread. This only applies if you are making the sandwich to be eaten at a later time.

CMV: Reddit should show your ratio of upvotes to downvotes in order to dissuade people from blanket down voting,3383,84,2019-08-14 23:13:25,"I've seen some Subreddits encourage users not to downvote posts so that theirs appears higher in rankings, which is a problem some subreddits are more blighted with than others (especially advice subreds). However, there is no real incentive for people not to do this because it has a potential upside to you, the downvoter, and very little potential downside. 

I also think it would encourage people to do more upvoting on posts they enjoy which helps strengthen the overall system. 

If there was a ratio it would become a points game just like karma is, and you could see if people were consistently contributing valuably, or just pooping in everyone else's puddings.",1
"CMV: If you move to a different country, you should learn the language.",3386,421,2019-06-13 08:55:13,"I was reading an askreddit post where somebody made the above point and was replied to by a flock of angry redditors who vehemently disagreed with this. None of these counter-arguments came anywhere close to convincing me, but it would be interesting to have my position challenged.

I'll preface this by saying that I've been teaching English as a foreign language for several years. I've lived in France, Germany, Colombia, Spain, Mexico and Japan. I have always made efforts to learn the language of the country that I have been in, to the point where I felt comfortable performing official duties without assistance (banks/government offices/making complaints). As such, I know it's hard but it is certainly possible. People who don't learn simply don't put in the effort.

Many of the people who were arguing in the thread I read seemed to believe that expecting someone to speak the language of the country they live in is racist. I see where they are coming from and it's not nice to be on the same side as the racists on this one. To me there is nothing racist about it. Nothing frustrates me more than seeing an American or British person who has spent years in another country without being able to speak the language.

Not learning the language of the country you live in...

- is rude.
- prevents you from being able to integrate.
- puts extra responsibility on those around you.
- is boring.
- leads to an overall less satisfying experience for all involved.

Now I get the allure of the expat bubble. I probably spent most of my time in them myself but I didn't use this as an excuse not to learn. 

I'd say, you've got a year of leeway and if you're not self-sufficient by that point, you're being inconsiderate.",1
CMV: Thank You Cards are a waste of time and money and sending them is a social convention that we should move away from,3372,147,2017-07-25 23:12:15,"The first, and I think most obvious argument, is that most circumstances that would usually necessitate writing Thank You cards for (ex. Weddings, birthdays, graduations) the honored party has probably already thanked in person most or all of the people who came and/or gave a gift already. Personally, I think this in-person thank you is more genuine than a card.

Secondly, why should the honored party have to pay for postage, envelopes, and the cards themselves, as well as spend up to several hours writing and addressing cards saying thank you for something that has already been thanked for?

It seems like such a waste when, to my last point, most of the people who receive the card will most likely open it up, look at it and say something like ""hmm, that was nice."" Then throw it away (or at most, stick it to the fridge for a week). That's what I do when I get one.

All this to say, I'm not an ungrateful person. I truly am thankful to the people who came to my event. I just think that Thank You cards are completely unnecessary.

"CMV: Gender dysphoria IS a mental illness and it’s nothing to be ashamed of, but we need to stop pretending like it isn’t",3379,554,2020-02-21 08:22:41,"EDIT: I’m editing my post because I used the terms disorder and illness as interchangeable when they aren’t. It should be disorder in the title and not illness. 

Before I begin, I want to clarify that I’m definitely not one of those people who thinks transgender people shouldn’t transition. What I believe and what I understand is that as of now, the best and most effective treatment to gender dysphoria is transition. However, I think people need to stop saying that gender dysphoria isn’t a mental disorder. Here’s why:

1. The DSM-V recognizes it as such. Gender dysphoria meets the requirements for a mental disorder to be classified as one. I’m not a professional and I don’t know them all by heart, but to make a few there’s the fact that it keeps people from functioning properly in society (when untreated) and that it causes great distress for the people experiencing it.
2. It actually advantages trans people if gender dysphoria is classified as a mental disorder, because that way certain insurance companies will pay for their transition.

 I understand that this can fuel rightist/transphobic arguments, but I think that denying reality like some governments do isn’t going to actually help in the long run.

Also to build up on point #1, people often refute this argument by saying that homosexuality was once considered a mental illness but was then removed and that considering gender dysphoria as a mental disorder is somehow part of a transphobic agenda. However, I just don’t think these two things are comparable. Homosexuality doesn’t cause distress or inability to properly fonction or anything like that. It WAS removed in the DSM because it was wrongfully put there and it didn’t fit the criteria. With gender dysphoria, it’s not the same story because it does fit the criteria.",1
"CMV: The singer of ""Should I Stay or Should I Go"" should go.",3374,151,2019-01-17 23:15:59,"After carefully reviewing the lyrics of ""Should I Stay or Should I Go,"" I have come to the conclusion that the singer/narrator is in an unhealthy relationship and should leave. Some key takeaways:


""If you say that you are mine

I'll be here till the end of time""


Textbook bargaining. Demanding something out of a relationship with lofty promises that will certainly not be delivered on. The singer is being possessive and demanding of their partner, which is already unhealthy. The promise to ""be here till the end of time"" is hyperbole and can't be trusted.


""It's always tease, tease, tease

You're happy when I'm on my knees

One day it's fine and next it's black

So if you want me off your back

Well, come on and let me know

Should I stay or should I go?""


The most telling verse, in my opinion. The partner is clearly not committed to this relationship, and seems to only be happy when the singer is down. The singer is unable to grasp the fact that they are being taken advantage of, but is beginning to discover that their partner is not as involved in this relationship as they are.


""This indecision's bugging me

If you don't want me, set me free

Exactly whom I'm supposed to be

Don't you know which clothes even fit me?

Come on and let me know

Should I cool it or should I blow?""


Echoed in Ecuadorian Spanish, this verse only provides more certainty that the singer's love is unrequited. The partner is flighty and doesn't seem to be concerned with the singer's life much at all, leading the singer to an existential crisis and complete breakdown of grammatical norms as be questions ""Exactly whom [sic] I'm supposed to be.""


The most telling line, of course, is in the chorus - as the narrator catches a glimpse of truth. 


""If I go there will be trouble

(Si me voy va a haber peligro)

And if I stay it will be double

(Si me quedo sera el doble)""


This is the most honest line of the song, as the singer realizes that he will be happier if he leaves. Despite the difficulty and uncertainty that leaving a relationship can cause, he catches on to the fact that staying in an unhealthy relationship will cause even more difficulty and uncertainty. The singer should leave this relationship and ideally focus on healing his own issues with codependency and possessiveness before entering in another relationship.

"CMV: If a company is important enough to warrant a bailout, then it's important enough to be nationalized.",3361,633,2020-04-10 10:28:14,"With the all the recent talk of Bailouts for airline companies, cruiselines, and other major entities,  I find myself returning to thoughts I had during the 2008 financial crisis. I dont like that public funds are being used to save private industry. The nature of the free market is supposed to be that when the economy goes tits up, companies either sink or swim. Only the government should be able to insulate itself with public funds, and if a company wants to perpetuate itself on tax dollars, then it should sell its assets to the US government to make that happen. 

I really dont like this view but I cant think of any valid  reason to bail out such luxury industries like passenger flights and cruise lines, and expect basically nothing in return. I get that if my view were the norm, then there'd be a lot of ruined lives and unemployed people, but that's the nature of the free market: if you get screwed because of volatile business practices you allowed to fester in your company, that's on you. The government and, by extension, we the people have no obligation to save your company because you made a bad business decision.

So...you mean to tell me someone that has been physically capable of creating a child for a decade (or so) lacks the maturity to be able to make this type of decision for himself?

Evidently this may be law in some places. I don't know, I'm infertile anyway so it isn't a problem for me. But this seems/feels pretty gross.

**Edit** - let's assume the person in this scenario is an adult. :) I was definitely not advocating for 12 year old kids to be able to get elective surgery!",1
CMV: Political parties are bad for electing a good candidate because it causes people to vote along party lines rather than the most proper candidate,3357,199,2019-07-22 01:09:47,"I don’t like to identify myself under a party because, in my opinion, a candidate should be voted for if you see them most fit for office and would benefit the country best, not just who is primarily representing your party. 

I think it’s ridiculous that states are constantly stuck voting for the lead candidate of the same party (I’m from Mississippi, and I would be willing to bet that we have voted for the lead Republican candidate since before my parents were alive). People will have more incentive to select a political party that their future policies won’t actually represent because they’re more likely to get more votes. It’s essentially become impossible to elect someone not Republican or Democrat, because states in the south will always vote republican (excluding Florida as its a swing state) and states in the northeast will always vote Democrat.

A quote I remember fondly from George Washington’s fairwell address in 1796, 

“* However [political parties] may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely in the course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.*""",1
CMV: People should not be heavily criticized for things they put on social media in the distant past,3352,407,2018-12-01 19:24:24,"I think that it is unfair for the internet to come down hard on people for things they put on social media a long time ago. I'm talking about cases such as James Gunn getting fired over tweets he made a long time ago (2009-2010), and Doja Cat getting criticized for using the word ""faggot"" in tweets from a few years back too. Here's why I hold this view:

1) People change. I think we can all say that the person you are today is not the person you were 10 years ago. Your beliefs and values change as time goes by, shaped by your varying life experiences. 10 years is a long time, in which many things can happen that drastically change your view on things. This is especially true throughout adolescence, when your thinking matures and your life is rapidly changing. Personally, many of my views were black and white years ago, but as I've gone through more experiences, my views have changed into something more grey. I think it would be really unreasonable if you treated me as if the only views I hold today were the views I held 10 years ago, many of which I would find abhorrent today.

2) People's lives don't revolve around social media. Building on the first point, people's views could change without them having to edit their social media history to reflect that. If my opinion on a subject matter changes, I'm probably not going to dig through my entire post history to delete every post that goes against my newly formed opinion. I think it's unreasonable to expect anyone to do that. Now, I don't know for sure if people like James Gunn's views on things have changed since he first made the comments that he did. Even if those views were changed, I don't expect him to dig through 10 years worth of tweets to delete offensive tweets.

Now I'm not denying that people should be responsible for what they put online, but I do think that others ought to be more understanding instead of simply dismissing a person for a distant mistake in the past. CMV.

CMV: I am Islamophobic.,3346,905,2020-02-02 07:46:33,"I mean that in both senses of the word. I hate Islam, and I am afraid of Islam. I do not hate Muslims for being Islamic; rather I see them as victims of an oppressive system.

I have done my best to listen to as many viewpoints as possible on this subject. Both for and against. My best friend for thirty years was Muslim, as was his family. I was very close to them. In large part, I began to change from neutral to anti on Islam because I never observed it giving anything positive to my friend. He behaved as if it were an anchor around his neck. An obligation. Never a source of hope or joy or enlightenment.

I could list the reasons I think Islam is harmful, but I don't want this conversation to become a slog of nitpicking over definitions and statistics. I will say, I believe Islam is unacceptable based on its widespread homophobia *alone.*

I'm posting here because, whenever I have criticized Islam, the response has been overwhelmingly negative. And *I do not understand why.* To the best of my knowledge, I have never had a Muslim tell me they were personally offended by my opinions. It is always non-Muslims, sometimes even atheists, defending Islam with a vigor as if I insulted a family member. This is baffling to me.

With such consistent opposition to my position, I need to consider that I am likely wrong. But I am almost never shown why. Opposition comes in the form of telling me I am a terrible person and should not judge others. I don't see why not, as I believe every human has the right to judge and be judged. What I am asking here is, **can anyone show me what is good in Islam, that justifies accepting or overlooking its harmful aspects?**

-----

EDIT: I got a response the other day that put so much in my head, I had to step away from replying. https://www.cpsa-acsp.ca/papers-2011/Cochrane.pdf *""there is a great deal of variation within the Muslim community in their opinions about these issues, and closer analyses suggest that Islam plays virtually no role in generating the distinctive opinions of Muslims. Muslims are more religious than other Canadians, but non-religious Muslims are more different from non-religious non-Muslims than highly religious Muslims are from highly religions non-Muslims. The effects of religion are not ruled out by the evidence uncovered in this paper, but nor does the religiosity hypothesis emerge as a standalone or especially persuasive explanation for the patterns of opinions among Muslim-Canadians. Islam, it seems, is not “the problem,” and efforts to curb the practice and visibility of Islam - efforts which are well under way in some European countries - are unlikely to address the ideological distinctiveness of Muslims, even about social issues like gay rights and abortion.""*

So, yes, this has succeeded in changing my view. **I no longer hate Islam. I hate Muslims.** And to be perfectly clear, this is not a violent hate. **It is a bottomlessly-disappointed hate.** Like the Bible or the Book of Mormon, the Quran is a book of fiction. I already know that art cannot force people to act. So how could I blame Islam? How could I blame a gun more than the one who pulls its trigger? I had already known that American Muslims are vastly different from Muslims in other countries, and it finally hit me that, if the religion itself is the same, the difference is the culture. The people. It's the _people,_ who choose to identify as Muslim, who use it to justify their desire for peace or their desire for bigotry. Whatever is in their hearts. Islam is not the SOURCE, it is the EXCUSE.

**I now realize that what I feel towards Muslims is EXACTLY the same disgust I feel towards the fans of Rick And Morty who threw insane childish tantrums in public restaurants. It is EXACTLY how I felt towards the fans of Avatar who convinced themselves that their soul is actually a Na'vi and they'll be one again when they die. It is EXACTLY how I feel towards the fans of Steven Universe who ignored the core values of the show and bullied a fan artist into attempting suicide, then turned against the show's creator's when they were told to stop, *because they felt morally justified*.** I am NOT making this comparison frivolously. A religion is nothing more than a toxic fandom. The only difference is how recently the central work was created.

How EMBARRASSING is that!? That after so many centuries, these holy books could have passed into myth, but they haven't? We can read Aesop's fables without insisting they are the only possible source of morality. We can take the lessons of Greek mythology without believing in the Pantheon. We can enjoy Marvel superheroes without praying to them. Yes, I *know* this is not an original thought. But it's only now hit me the enormity of it. **If the Quran were allowed to be merely a book, I would merely dislike it, if I thought about it at all. My problem is the people so weak of individual spirit that they NEED it to be MORE.** I entirely understand the need for humans to seek purpose. But SEEK it! Find your own! Find it in other people! How lazy, to accept it pre-packaged, because someone told you, 'Here's all the answers. You can stop questioning now.'

I've watched Star Trek without calling myself a Trekkie. I've watched My Little Pony without calling myself a Brony. I don't make my enjoyment of those shows my primary descriptor. I don't make it my LIFE. I called myself a MGTOW for about a week. I saw a video that explained it, and I liked the concept of not letting other people define you. Then I took a look at the community and saw it was almost entirely broken, bitter men complaining about their exes. The community were not upholding the ideas I had been attracted to, so I stopped calling myself MGTOW. I called myself a libertarian for a little while. I read about it and thought its values lined up well with mine. Then I saw too many libertarians expressing support for anarcho-capitalism. This was not a belief I shared, so I stopped calling myself libertarian, because I didn't want something I don't believe in to be someone else's first impression of me.

I have never in my life heard someone say, ""9/11 was the day I decided to stop being a Muslim."" Or the day of the Pulse nightclub shooting. Or after hearing about the Rotherham rapes. Or on and on and on. What do I hear instead? 'Please don't blame my religion!'

Allright. I don't anymore.

I blame **you,** the person who chooses to belong to it.

I entirely understand the insidious family pressure Islamic culture uses to keep people ensnared. And the disgusting practice of murdering apostates. But the Catholic Church was one of the most powerful forces in the world. Droves of people left after the reveal of their unspeakably evil systematic protection of child rapists. And while the Catholic Church still exists as an entity, numbers are strength, and theirs are dwindling. Muslims could follow the example of Catholics: leave in such great numbers that the zealots can't kill you all. They could. If they chose to.

Or if you absolutely must keep that word branded on your forehead, you could at least not let others decide how it makes you behave.

I say this with a lot of pain. I'd rather forgive. I'd rather not hate. This is not a gloating victory lap. This is my head sinking into my arms in weariness. I have to hold to what I see as true, even if it's what no one wants to hear. Including me.",1

**Edit:**  Wow I had no idea this would blow up over the weekend. First of all, your President, the one that was elected by the majority of America (and from what I gather, most of you), actually EXPANDED the surveillance program. In essence, you elected someone that furthered the program. Now before you start saying that it was started under Bush, which is true (and no I didn't vote for Bush either, I'm 3rd party all the way), why did you then elect someone that would further the program you so oppose? Michael Hayden himself (who was a director in the NSA) has spoke to the many similarities between Bush and Obama relating to the NSA surveillance. Obama even went so far as to say that your privacy concerns were being addressed. In fact, it's also believed that several members of Congress KNEW about this as well. BTW, also people YOU elected. Now what can we do about this? Obviously vote them out of office if you are so concerned with your privacy. Will we? Most likely not. In fact, since 1964 the re-election of incumbent has been at 80% or above in every election for the House of Representatives. For the Sentate, the last time the re-election of incumbent's dropped below 79% was in 1986. (**Source:** http://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/reelect.php). So most likely, while you sit here and complain that nothing is being done about your privacy concerns, you are going to continually vote the same people back into office. 

The other thing I'd like to say is, what is up with all the hate?!? For those of you saying ""people like you make me sick"" and ""how dare you believe that this is ok"" I have something to say to you. So what? I'm entitled to my opinion the same way you are entitled to your opinions. I'm sure that are some beliefs that you hold that may not necessarily be common place.

CMV: There’s no fact or logic based reason to deny climate change. The only reason republicans deny it is because it’s a primary democrat talking point.,3322,1590,2019-10-16 20:27:28,"
The science is clear that climate change is real and we’re causing it. 99% of the people saying it’s not true have zero working knowledge of the issue and have zero credibility. The only reason republicans deny it is because a democrat brought it to the forefront and it’s primarily a democrat talking point. Had a Republican brought it to the public eye, they’d be signing a completely different tune. 

Decades worth of study and vigorous research has gone into understanding climate change and there’s mountains of evidence proving it’s happening and we’re causing it. If you’re denying it, odds are, you’re a republican, for one, and you have no real working knowledge of the topic, just parroted information that’s easily disproven with a very quick google search.

**Edit**: By “Republicans”, I’m more referring to the common citizen, not the politicians. They’re definitely preaching against it for the money

**Edit 2**: Clarification: I’m not tying to lump the south together. I used it as a general term for the region I lived in. My personal experiences with climate change deniers comes from living in western Kentucky for about a decade. I am not speaking of the rest of “the south”",1
CMV: Most people are not well read enough to reasonably advocate for political or economic change,3318,330,2018-08-12 22:36:02,"**Edit: ""Well read"" was a poor choice of words. I think ""have done their due diligence"" might be more accurate.**

I'm writing this because I want to be proven wrong, because people saying political things, especially as if obvious has started to annoy and anger me more. Especially if they're making fun of someone for their political views, even if I disagree with those views. I hate feeling angry, so hopefully writing my thoughts out will help.

In trying to figure out my own political views, I've come to realize that I can't reasonably hold the views I held, or any other views. I studied economics, mainly the school of thought that appealed to me. But then more and more I came to realize that I couldn't say if the Keynesian or post-keynesian or the Chicago school or MMT etc. were correct, and that even people who devote their lives to the study of economics struggle with the same thing. The same thing happened in philosophy, especially as I came to realize the importance of epistemology and ontology.

And you can't reasonably expect people to put in the effort and time that it takes to sort through these fields. And that there is still such debate among the experts that even if you become and expert, the truth will not be obvious. I've come to understand what Socrates meant when he said something like ""I only know that I know nothing"".

I've also come to believe that people hold the beliefs they do more for social reasons. Less for the truth of the beliefs, but more because their reaffirm their identity, and their social bonds.

I can't blame them for that, or for not spending thousands of hours sorting through political thought, philosophy and economics. But a part of me still believes that they haven't done their due diligence, and I get angry that they can affirm themselves and their beliefs, while I sit here uncertain, unable to succinctly articulate why, or how to get this across properly.",1
CMV: People who actively decline to donate organs should be declined organ donations themselves,3296,392,2019-09-25 18:51:32,"I see how this is a morally problematic stance.
I am generally not for “what goes around comes around” approaches, but in my view, organ donations are literally a matter of life issue and arise above just the individual.
It’s more than just being a little egoistic if you purposefully decline to save other people’s lives.
If you actively, (which includes being over 18 and mentally stable) decline to donate your organs than I personally think it is fair to not grant you such a valuable gift. 
On the other side such a rule could push people to rethink their stance and would probably have an immensely positive effect on the number of organ donors.

The only two problems I see with this is that in reality it will be tough to draw such a border between those who “actively” decline organs and those who might be pressured by their environment or aren’t stable etc. and that such a restriction could lead to a sort of organ elitism by people then demand that we should also not give organs to addicts, obese people etc..

As often religious believes are a reason for not wanting to donate, I think that a lot of those believes also include not wanting to receive strangers organs anyways.

I am really interested to hear your thoughts on this. CMV!


Edit: This has been an exciting read so far! As some things keep on being brought up:

A) this is a thought experiment, I’m not in a position to enforce anything I’m here to challenge a viewpoint and that overall philosophical not bureaucratically.

B) This is about people actively opting out on donation, not people being unable to donor due to illness etc. at those are not active choices. 

C) I agree that the opt-out system is a great way to increase donations and I am very much for it’s implementation. If we wanna go down the rabbits whole of implementing the here proposed scenario it was actually what I had in mind, because in the opt-out scenario an active choice is the most obvious. But this would further of course need a lot of detailed legal work I am unable to provide.",1
CMV: People should be considered organ donors unless they opt out of it.,3303,446,2019-11-16 04:41:32,"I’ll be honest, I’m not entirely sure why we have to opt into becoming an organ donor. I’m not sure how the rest of the world works, but this is how it works in Canada. I personally see no reason why this is the case.

I understand for cultural or religious reasons, and for that reason there *should* be a way to opt out of it. I agree with that 100%. I just have a hard time understanding why it’s not this way and why those who want to donate have to be the ones to opt in.

Donating basic organs wouldn’t have an affect during an open casket wake. The corpse would be sewn up and nobody would know they’re missing organs. As for skin, eyes, etc, that’s completely different and people should opt into that as well.

I believe that there should be a scale of donation. Something like this:

* Non-donor
* Non-visible organ donor
* Complete organ donor

I believe that everyone should be considered a “non-visible” organ donor unless they decide to go one step up or one step down.",1
CMV: We overvalue uninformed opinions in our society.,3292,220,2019-08-04 09:41:17,"As a music undergrad, I would argue with my piano prof about interpretation. One day, as I forcefully suggested that in my opinion, something should be a certain way, she fired back with, ""You don't know enough yet to have your own opinion!""

...what! You can't say that! I even mentioned it to the chairman of the department, who, in a much nicer way, basically said, ""Yeah, she's kinda right.""

And now, years later? After travelling down a long path of development and learning? I agree with her. I didn't know enough then to be arguing like I knew what the hell I was talking about, because comparatively, I totally didn't. I needed to have more respect for expertise, and less confidence that my beginner opinion was worth what I thought it was.

And this is *music*; a subjective art form, in which this happened. Once we get into the realm of science, the argument only become more solid: Some people, *many* people, just don't know enough to be voicing an opinion on things. None of them ever want to hear it, just as I didn't want to hear it, but it's true.

If we take an issue like climate change, the expert consensus is in: It's happening, and it's a problem. And how did we ever get so far away from realizing that that should be *the end of the conversation* for most people? The experts are in, and what better choice to most of us have when it comes to something we're not qualified to judge, than to listen to the experts? Why are 95% percent of our population not going, ""Well, that's what the experts say, so I have to go with that, because unless I do years of serious work, I'm not in a position to argue with them."" ? 

And yet we accept congressmen, political pundits, and even our neighbor Bob saying, ""I don't *believe* in global warming."" Why should anyone give a crap what he believes? Why does he think he remotely knows enough to have his own opinion on the matter? His opinion is unimportant, and it shouldn't be that big a deal for even him to accept that his opinion on matters he has no expertise in is not important. No one knows everything. Most of us aren't even experts in one thing.

So, what is it? Are our egos so fragile? Did we get it hammered into our brains as children how wonderful our opinions automatically were? Regardless, it seems clear to me that we are far to ready to give credence and value to uninformed opinions in our society. Just think about all the talk shows, Youtube pundits, and the like that focus around people of no relevant knowledge giving their opinion on everything under the sun. This is to our great detriment, and we need to try and advocate and try to correct for this to whatever extent with can. CMV.",1
"CMV: There is no valid reason for looting stores (ex, Target) as a result the George Floyd incident",3286,1028,2020-06-02 05:34:05,"I’m all for protests. I won’t say I condone riots or setting buildings on fire but I can understand why they happen (riots are the voice of the unheard), I can also understand looting when there is a scarcity of basic necessities in a time where an oppressor is stockpiling resources while people are dying.

I tried but cannot think of a valid justification for looting a store off the back of someone being murdered by a cop. It seems like opportunistic thievery. I know there’s clearly systemic racial issue leading to inequality and that a small percentage of people are getting disgustingly wealthy, and the elected officials don’t represent people, etc etc. I think that looting in this situation undermines the goal for equality/seeking justice - ie. stealing a bunch of lamps from Target is not only ineffective.

CMV: private gun ownership is useless against government tyranny,3285,1253,2018-11-07 23:14:02,"I will freely admit to being a liberal in favor of gun control. But my fiancé is a single issue voter about gun rights. Gun rights outrank every other issue to him and his friends, and I'd like to understand where they come from before we marry.

I asked them why private gun ownership ranks so highly in importance to them, and they all said it's because an armed population will be able to overthrow a tyrannical government if it becomes necessary. They also cared about self-defense, but overthrowing a tyrannical government was the main reason. They cite the Revolutionary War as an example.

In my view, a modern armed population will never be able to win against the current US military. Civilians don't have Apache helicopters. Almost everyone I know can't run 5 miles straight. At best, it'd be years of bloody civil war like Syria's and they still wouldn't win. 

As the years go by, military technology will only continue to outpace the tech available to civilians and this rationale will become more and more far-fetched. I just don't see how private gun ownership would allow us to overthrow the government at any point in the future. 

The whole argument seems like a theoretical exercise that shouldn't be the foremost political issue to anyone. I hope to understand opposing viewpoints.

CMV: The United States government in it's current incarnation is largely if not wholly illegitimate,3275,348,2019-09-26 22:41:48,"Congress literally does not care what the majority of Americans think. Instead they only care what a rich few do. They're kept on a leash by their campaign donors and spend more time on average in office fundraising for the next election cycle rather than enacting laws. Nonetheless the fact that Congress members don't read the bills they vote on. Maybe if they didn't have to fundraise they could (probably still wouldn't but whatever).
https://act.represent.us/sign/problem-fba

Also campaign donations will inherently lead to corruption. I base this claim on the fact that a significant majority 80-92% of the time, the person who wins an election is the person who received more donations and fundraising. https://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/money-and-elections-a-complicated-love-story/amp/

There have literally been times when Congress passed laws directly handed to them by businesses (aka private citizens).


Their approval rating currently sits at a crazy low 20% with 75% of us actively disapproving of them. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2019/06/01/politics/poll-of-the-week-congress-approval-rating/index.html

All of this contributes to my idea that I would even go so far to say that every sitting member of Congress in its' current iteration is corrupt beyond belief and is a hostile entity. An enemy of the United States, the Constitution, and the people. Our democracy is not representative of our actual population or our beliefs. Instead it's a puppet legislative organization, and if you follow the money it's basically a bunch of CEO's having a bid war for the future of our world.

Things that I think ought to be done which are also likely to be dumb and underthought.

1. Outlaw campaign donations and outside interference in elections. Each candidate gets a set amount of money from the FEC in order to make their platform heard. Political ads paid for by non-affiliates of the involved candidates then also become illegal. Only those ads paid for by their affiliates can be aired or shown. Granted this would not affect journalism, if a scandal breaks it breaks, just not in the form of advertising.

2. All forms of (edit: monetary) lobbying should instantaneously be made illegal.

3. The dumbest idea. Try every member of Congress for perjury, on the idea that they lied under oath. 

I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter: So help me God.”

Currently they are not protecting the constitution from domestic enemies, and rather have become them. They are not well or faithfully discharging their duties, spending more time fundraising than legislating.
Perjury is defined as lying under oath, but only becomes a crime when they intentionally reaffirm this. In this case reelection.

I would even argue some of this could be considered Treasonous behavior. I really want to be wrong so please change my view.

TLDR-Congress is made of entirely corrupt individuals not representing the US population or their constituents and has lost their legitimacy.

CMV: The trend of video games becoming a service instead of a tangible single product like they always used to be is not a net positive for gamers,3280,166,2019-04-01 03:06:40,"As I see it with technologies like Google Stadia, MS xCloud and potentially others in the near future, publishers and developers try to take every bit of control and sense of ownership from the hands of the end users (the gamers).

I can accept the arguments of practicality and ease of use, but I reckon that it should only remain an option and that the delivery of games should continue to be handled the traditional way - which means via either physical or digital copies, practically owned by the user, stored in his drives and operated at his own time of choice without the need for subscriptions.

A very short list of the main problems so I find in game streaming: 

a) the sense of ownership is totally abolished. You essentially rent the games you play month to month, paying a fee for that time and never owning anything for offline use. You could pay hundreds of dollars and if you don’t pay for one more month you end up with nothing but thin air.

b) the image quality. Streaming is actually video. Video is always noisy compared to locally rendered graphics - yes even video sourced from 4K blu rays doesn’t compare with the cleanliness and vibrancy (in absence of more proper words) of a game rendered on the screen of my PC by my rig. I think it’s an intrinsic video feature that cannot be improved much - if at all. I hope you understand what I mean. 

c) it creates a very bad precedent. Many people claim that it will only be an option, and that traditional systems will continue to exist for many years to come (and I hope so too), but I fear that this situation is the secret wet dream not only for Google, but Sony and probably other big players too. 

Do I think of it wrong? Am I mistaken at some point? Change my view.

CMV: Getting rid of the plastic straw to ‘help the turtles’ is just a coverup for the much bigger issue of coastal development.,3269,186,2019-09-01 17:19:27,"Now it may be easy to change my view as I don’t really have much data to back me up here. The way I think about it is while straws and plastic debris in the ocean is killing turtles, it’s also an easy scapegoat, now I’m all for getting rid of single use plastics because they pollute our oceans, but governments and people are acting like the issue is solved because McDonald’s has paper straws.

The destruction of turtle nesting areas and coastal development in places like Hawaii is destroying the breeding grounds of turtles and killing them before they’re even hatched, turtles are forced to go to other beaches which affects the hatch rate and gender of turtles. Recently as many as 70% of sea turtles are born female due to rising temperatures.

Now a few things are being done to protect the nesting grounds of turtles, but it’s posed as a much smaller issue than “get metal straw save the environment” when it really just strokes our egos and is not as important. 

A turtle chokes on plastic, it gets eaten by something bigger and the cycle continues. A turtle nest gets crushed, it’s buried forever and no creature on earth benefits from that death. 

I believe that it is government propaganda due to the only thing people care about... money. It’s cheaper to get rid of plastic than to ACTUALLY conserve the environment by limiting tourism during nesting season or even just staying off the beach. That won’t happen though because money.

The one thing I see against my suggestion is the fact that conserving those beaches means many local people lose their jobs working in coastal tourist attractions and hotels. My counter to that is the fact that people lived there before huge companies moved in, and they will find a way to live after they leave. If you want to live or are born on a tropical island, respect your surroundings and don’t destroy habitats just because it’s easier to work in a hotel restaurant than to fish or work in a local shop.

"CMV: The 8 to 5 workday, in an office M to F, in a modern office environment creates more problems than it solves",3265,344,2020-02-08 00:55:42,"This has come up recently as my company underwent a merger, and my geographically dispersed team, who were previously working from home except for travel, were suddenly, with a months notice, required to work in the office (if we live within 25 miles of one) 8 to 5 Mon through Friday unless an emergency like sick kid or 2 feet of snow.  

1) The 8 to 5 assumes that employees don’t have kids to get off to school in the morning, or if they do, there is a stay at home parent for coverage, which is not realistic for double income households

2) the assumption that everyone takes an hour lunch break.  Sure some people like to go offsite and get a hot meal, or hang out in the cafeteria for an hour, but Many people can eat lunch in 20 minutes or less, while multitasking 

3) I get that having teams co-located in an office may enhance productivity if you can reach out and tap a coworker on the arm for a request that may take an hour going through email, but if corporate culture has tools available for constant and reliable communication, I don’t see a difference

CMV: You can’t expect those working for the minimum wage to do more then minimal work,3260,801,2019-03-11 20:50:29,"I’ll try to keep it short because I can ramble.

I may just be acting like a disgruntled retail employee but this is my view on this.

I’m not debating minimum wage rates or anything like that, I realize even at a living wage a minimum wage salary is just going to get you by not put you in a position to save, etc. so my point would probably stand despite an increase in minimum wage.

If an employee is being paid what is deemed as the lowest amount legally able to be paid to an employee you can’t expect than the lowest possible effort they can get away with from those employees. 

A lot of minimum wage employees have other things on their mind, such as advancing economically, they may have a side hustle or be a student, both of which are probably way more promising (as far bringing them a meaningful career and satisfaction from their work) then whatever minimum wage job their currently working.

That being said, I totally respect those individuals who give everything their all and will go above and beyond for little or no reward. That’s definitely a positive quality for someone to have IMO but it’s unrealistic for the average individual raised in American, watching countless people make millions off BS, to be satisfied living paycheck to paycheck making minimum wage and therefore give maximum effort in position with little possibly of raising the ‘corporate ladder’ and a good chance you’ll be constantly in fear of company restructuring, lay offs, etc. 

To sum up my point, most people (unless your one of those fine individuals truly motivated by helping, improving thing, etc.) especially those working for minimum wage are solely motivated by money so for a company or even customers of a retail business (or any business not motivated by extra tips for good service) to think an employee is suppose to be go above and beyond or even really care that much is u realistic and somewhat delusional considering all the factors.

CMV: China is bad and I dislike the country for its government,3251,825,2019-10-09 05:21:07,"I am a gamer, I truly don't care a whole lot about politics. I do keep up with some breatuberish people because I like watching their content, but my general position is that the U.S. government sucks and it isn't my job to fix it because I want to do other things.


Recently, there have been some incidents where gaming/entertainment people have been fired/disciplined for going against the political interest of china. Here are some examples:

Yeah so I dislike china and its government. No qualms with the people. I feel that they are limit free speech in their own country and combine their political stances with their economy(through propaganda or whatever) to force their view on the rest of the world. At the very least, I prefer governments that can be HEAVILY criticized constantly. Take America! All the europeans I've ever met have strong opinions on all the things we are doing wrong and I would be happy to have them come to America and give a speech about it. It is fine. America does a lot wrong but we are fairly good at politics(ignoring the horrible high profile cases)

I honestly think that one human trying to make money and work in a field he/she likes should not have to ""watch their mouth"" about china, they suck and are bad. Money be damned.

Gaming companies have been known to censor something in worldwide releases of their game so China can play it and also have been known to moderate Twitch chat and the like so that Tiannanmen Square is auto-moderated. Absolutely RIDICULOUS


All this leads to me thinking China is bad. CMV!",1
CMV: Allowing your child to be overweight should be considered abuse/neglect.,3257,393,2018-11-11 11:30:12,"* To clarify, this does not apply if your child has a medical condition that affects their weight, diet, or ability to exercise. This is for parents who let their kids eat too much and exercise too little, and thus become overweight at a young age *

I have a lot of emotions about this so I apologize if it’s written poorly. Basically, I was overweight from the time I was about 3 until 18 when I finally started buying my own groceries and being physically active for the first time in my life. My parents never taught me about healthy eating or exercising. I don’t think I ever even heard them use the word “healthy”. They tried putting me in soccer and t-ball when I was young but I would just sit in the field and pick dandelions because I was chubby and hated running. Not only was I never being active, but I was being fed garbage all the time as well. My mom’s cooking usually consisted of chicken fingers, fries, Kraft dinner, occasionally spaghetti or shepherd’s pie, basically the same comfort food and junk that she grew up on. My school lunches were always chalk full of sugary snacks and drinks and things like canned Alphagetti pasta and bologna + Cheese Whiz sandwiches.

I would say my mother was very permissive which is why I had no self control or discipline when it came to over indulging and being lazy. I would say no, or cry, or throw a tantrum and she must’ve let me have my way every time if my weight was any indicator. I “didn’t like” cooked vegetables so I always got them raw with ranch dip. I didn’t like exercising so I was allowed to watch tv or read or play around inside. I was happy doing those things, sure, but being overweight essentially ruined my self esteem, confidence, and ability to socialize by the time I was in high school, much like other forms of abuse do to a child. Maybe not as extreme. But similar.  

I’m now 26 and even though I lost a bunch of weight in my early 20’s and developed healthier habits, I still struggle with a slight grudge against my parents (mostly my mother) for letting me go on like that for so long. I have my own child now and every day I work hard to break the cycles and not fall into the same parenting habits I was raised with. I was bullied about my weight all through elementary school and my mom knew how much it hurt me, but not once did she ever sit me down and say “look, I know your weight bothers you, so let’s try to make some healthier choices and you’ll feel a lot better”, or anything like that. I’m not sure where my family doctor stood on the issue or if he ever talked to her about it. I definitely don’t remember it ever being addressed as a health problem, I was just “the fat girl” and that was that.

I feel like because I was so young I shouldn’t have had a choice. They should’ve done more. If there was some kind of legal action that could be taken in this situation, such as classifying it as abuse or neglect, maybe she would have tried harder. Please help CMV. 

Edit: thank you for the overwhelming responses. I have some deltas to give out. I just wanted to clarify though, I posted in CMV because I do not enjoy feeling this way. I struggle with it and feel guilty about it all the time which is why I asked for help in changing my view. I understand I come across as some entitled slob who never let go of my teen angst but I assure you I am a very sensitive, empathetic person and feeling this way about my mom for so long has likely been more detrimental than the extra weight ever was. 
She’s the only person I have left and I’ve been working on building a better relationship with her for a long time. This issue has just been a hard one for me, so, thank you all for helping me change my extreme view.

Edit 2: I’m new to Reddit but I understand why it’s so popular now. I’m blown away by the intelligence and integrity shown here, even those of you who made me feel like a total idiot. Thank you again - this has been therapeutic in a way and I’m learning a lot.",1
CMV: Anyone who identifies with the Joker or Harley Quinn in any of their incarnations is admitting (consciously or otherwise) that they're an asshole.,3259,380,2020-04-11 11:05:30,"The Joker is a bad person.  He has never not been a bad person.  Everyone who wrote him wrote him as a bad person.  Everyone who played him played him as a bad person.  He has always been a personification of obscene, perverted, absurd, but recognizable evil.  In his most sympathetic incarnation (Joaquin Phoenix), his portrayal only makes society culpable in his evil without ever excusing his - he's still a bad man doing bad things for bad reasons, but we have some unwarranted sympathy because he's pathetic and because we might've stopped him.

Harley Quinn is also a bad person.  She is, minor details aside, a female sexed-up Robin for Joker who is as evil as Robin is good.  There's no redeeming value in her character beyond some occasional humor and sex appeal; apart from that, she's as much an irredeemable villain as the Joker.

Their relationship is one of abuse and mutual reinforcement of evil behavior.  It is not a love story between two nonconformists rebelling against the world, it's two abusive psychopaths killing for fun.

My view is that if you look at these characters or their relationship, see some aspect of yourself and feel anything but a horrified chill up your spine, you must be an asshole.

You're a Joker looking for his Harley Quinn?  Asshole.

You're a Harley Quinn looking for her Joker?  Asshole.

CMV: Black Lives Matter the movement and the organization should be treated and judged separately,3247,843,2020-09-02 18:41:46,"After I received a wordless permaban on /r/selfawarewolves on the subject I believe I thought it's a good idea to raise the topic of BLM the movement and organization.   

Let me preface by saying I highly support the BLM movement but I am highly apprehensive of the organization, to the point I consider them disparate and at times acting in completely different ends. To elaborate:

1) The BLM organization is very decentralized. While the *movement* prioritizes racial injustice and stresses fighting police abuse, the organization's goals appear unfocused, leading to disparate postulates depending on a given city's BLM chapter. For example, one of the BLM co-founders has admitted to its members being trained marxists and I don't believe people who support BLM the movement have signed up to support an anarchist or a marxist political option, policy or any poltiical agenda for that matter. Chicago's BLM has cheered for looters, while another BLM has used BLM popularity to ask for extreme defunding the police - not demilitarize or reduce its abuses, but scrap it entirely in the name of anarchist agenda. Another BLM asked for reintroduction of artificial racial divides or appropriation of property in the name of black nationalism. I don't believe people that support the movement have signed up to support any of these. With all due respect, some of those postulates appear to have an opposite effect than what people supporting the movement intend, while those on the fringe and to the opposite side of the matter are visibly polarized and radicalized.

2) The BLM organization is conveniently using the movement to shield itself from critique. Similar to Antifa, if you criticize Antifa you are conveniently branded fascist; if you criticize BLM you are conveniently branded racist. It should not be banned, taboo or even politically incorrect to criticize extremists, looters, violent people or terrorist activities just because they fly the BLM banner.

3) BLM the organization is IMO shady about its finances and where its funding comes from in its entirety and where it goes. While its unclear where donations to BLM go, I believe people should be at the very least skeptical of the org until it is verified that BLM *the movement* and BLM the organization's goals are aligned - something that I currently highly doubt.  


Because of the above, BLM the org has successfully shielded itself from responsibility for any transgressions it is warranted or that of its more extreme members, much to the BLM movement's detriment. Having little central leadership or unified postulates while sharing the name with the movement makes it not only difficult to hold people responsible but also difficult for the movement that achieved popularity to achieve its broader goals.  

What would change my view is proving the BLM organization's actions and goals are aligned with the popular movement and that the organization is worthy of people's trust to implement them in reality.

Thanks and discuss!  

Edit: [My thoughts on the matter are well summarized by Terry Crews.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzR8x_jlGaI) - It also well demonstrates how the organization and the movement is muddled by the interviewer which leads to total misunderstanding of Terry's point.  

Edit 2: Guys, I'm not here to discuss marxism or the marxist view on the movement. I believe the BLM movement is disparate from the org in the sense it doesn't support *any* political option, merely is against racial injustice and police abuse. Whatever the option would be be it leftist or rightist, that's the point where I find it straying from the BLM movement's spirit and ought to be treated separately. I find this to be making the discussion go wildly offtopic.",1
CMV: Transfiguration is not that useful and should be an elective,3237,194,2020-05-01 23:24:40,"I understand why transfiguration was part of the core curriculum.  Vanishment is a sub-field of transfiguration, and in historical times everyone needed to know it for sanitary reasons.  However, in the modern day this isn't the case, and I feel an inordinate amount of class time is devoted to a subject that is fairly limited in its applications.

Why do people need to know how to turn mice into teacups?  Animal cruelty aside, why not just buy a teacup?  Or, in a pinch, I'm sure a creative wizard could easily create one with the right combination of charms.  Or simply summon a suitable vessel.

I'm slightly more impressed by conjuring.  The idea of creating matter out of thin air is interesting.  However, charms can do that too, and too it better.  Matter conjured through transfiguration disappears after awhile.  Matter created by the Engorgement Charm or Doubling Charm has no such restrictions.

For these reasons, I believe that transfiguration should be removed from the core curriculum, and reduced to an elective.  The empty spot in the schedule could be devoted to extra charms or potions, or dare I suggest general knowledge not specific to magic to make our wizards more well-rounded people.",1
CMV: Debate moderators should cut the mic after the allotted time has passed.,3236,145,2019-06-29 00:58:48,"I have noticed that during debates (like those that took place over the last two days between dem. primary contenders), often times the moderators will try to get a candidate to stop talking after their time has run out but the candidate will continue to just ramble on and on, largely ignoring the moderator for significant periods of time. My contention is that 

- this gives an unfair advantage to candidates who are the most boistrous
- even if what they are saying isn't particularly compelling, they are boxing out valuable time for other contenders
- there is a really easy fix. just cut the mic after the time has run out and move on.

CMV: Separate Chess Titles Given Exclusively to Women Should Not Exist,3214,551,2019-01-19 06:42:30,"First off, here's some information for those who are unfamiliar with the chess world:

In chess, players are given ratings based on the results of the games they've played. The higher the number is the better the rating. For every game played, your rating will either increase or decrease depending on your result (even for draws, but less so). For example, if a 1000 rated player beats another 1000 rated player, then the winner might receive a new rating of 1012 and the loser might receive a new rating of 988. If however, the 1000 rated player beat a 2000 rated player then their rating would increase by a larger amount and visa versa.

Beginners are roughly rated between 0-1400. Intermediates are roughly between 1400-1900. Experts very roughly being 1900+

In order to be awarded a chess title of Grandmaster (GM), your rating has to be 2500. This is unless you are a woman, in that case you can receive the title ""Woman Grandmaster"" (WGM) at 2300.

This may seem like a small difference on the surface, but it is in fact significantly easier to obtain. There are roughly 1,500 people in the world with a 2500 rating or above, whereas there are roughly 15,000 people with a 2300 or above.

The lowest female chess title is the Women Candidate Master title which is rewarded at a 2000 rating. 2000 is my rating, if I was a woman I would have a chess title. Because I am a male however, I will likely never receive a chess title (unless I git real gud).

Common justifications for the use of separate female chess titles starting from the most stupid to the least stupid:

A) ""Women are biologically at a disadvantage in chess""

This is a perspective shared by quite a few high profile GMs, such as Bobby Fischer and Nigel Short showing that you do not in fact have to be smart to be good at chess. The common argument is that men's brains are wired to be logical, women's brains are wired to be emotional. I'm of the opinion that there's just less female chess players than male ones, I've read a couple studies that say females are rated similarly to males but there's just way less of them so of course there's not going to many women at the top.

B) ""If we took away women chess titles, there would only be 12 female GMs in the world""

Well then fuck it, then there'll only be 12 female GMs in the world. The rating system is based on an objective system that does not care about gender, I want it kept that way. It's demeaning to give these fake titles.

C) ""Women are socially at a disadvantage in chess""

This argument actually has a tiny bit of credibility. If you go to a chess tournament, you will notice that 99% of the people there are men. I can imagine how this could dissuade some women from continuing. However, you do not make progress in chess purely from chess tournaments. It's all done online now. Anonymous chess accounts, it's so fucking easy. I got to 2000 rated just from using anonymous chess accounts online, they don't know my gender unless I state it. There's so many learning resources to help without making yourself known, youtube videos, chess books, practice online etc that I don't really buy this argument anymore. Especially as I've never witnessed any kind of sexism at a chess tournament before.

D) ""Women should have more female role models in chess""

As I said before, it feels like 99% of tournament halls are men. This is the case EXCEPT for children. It is much more equal for children, I would estimate about a 30:70 ratio of girls to boys. In fact, my very first tournament opponent was against a 10 year old girl who I beat and flexed on her afterwards while she was crying (I joke, I won but it was very close).

It seems that the number of female chess players will decrease significantly with age. There's a number of suggested reasons for this: 1) Girls are not as interested in the competitive chess arena as much as boys. 2) Because chess online and in tournament halls are filled with men, so they lose interest.

I accept that. But is offering chess titles to women barely rated higher than me going to change that? No. They've been giving out female chess titles for 70 years now, it's not working. Take a fucking hint already.

Is it going to make guys like me incredibly salty when they have to pay £40 to enter a tournament when female titled players rated the same as me get to enter for free because of their weakass title? Yes, very much so.

E) ""But why does it even matter? It's just a title""

It matters because these titles mean a lot to chess players. I've seen people cry when receiving a title. Hell, I would cry. By giving chess titles to people at my rating, it devalues the chess title. Also, you get to enter tournaments for free and win prize funds so it's basically a part-time job instead of a hobby when you're titled. Finally, it opens the avenue for online coaching, you can brag about it on your cv etc.

In conclusion, I know nobody outside of chess cares about this. But I also know that if I posted this on r/chess I would get downvoted to oblivion (seriously, all that sub does is downvote) so I come to you, no knowledge of chess is required to answer this. Give me a reason why there should be separate female titles.

"CMV: If you critically examine the Bible like a movie script, you'd find God as a poorly developed character with inconsistent character traits and unexplained attitudes.",3220,433,2019-01-12 14:17:06,"I've been thinking about how horribly The Last Jedi was written, and how inconsistently the characters carried over their personalities from The Force Awakens. And then it hit me. What if the Bible was examined in the same way?

I thought back to the days where I went to Sunday school and learned about God. How God is supposed to *love* humankind to the point where he sends a part of himself (Jesus) to endure physical suffering and make the greatest sacrifice in all of Christian history. But then it hit me: Why does God love humans? Does God choose to love humans? If not, can God have no choice but to love humans? Why does God *exclusively* love humans?

But of course, God couldn't *exclusively* love *all* humans, since he had some humans kill other humans in his name. So why choose *some* humans over others? Does he *choose* to love based on who agrees with him? And what about the fact that God created humans *last*? It is clear throughout the story of Adam and Eve that God can grant eternal life/suffering and take it away in a moment's notice. This is the conclusion you get with the story of ""The Fall"", where Eve gets tricked by a snake into eating a fruit from the forbidden tree causing humanity's banishment from the Garden of Eden and subsequent physical suffering we have to endure. 

So if God has the power to grant/take *eternal life* and *immunity to suffering*, why couldn't he create just humans *first*? Wouldn't he allow them to be immune to the effects of entropy (hunger, deterioration) in a *breathable atmosphere* on an Earth without anything *but them*, and interact with his creation? Why did he have to create the other animals and plants first? Hell, why did he even have to create *light* and *a planet*? He could've created Adam and Eve and make them *immune to suffering*. A part of the story in The Fall is that God gives Adam and Eve the capacity to feel shame. When they notice that they're naked, they quickly cover themselves up. So if he is *also* able to change the way we feel about certain scenarios (another example would be the story of Moses where God 'hardens' the Pharoah's heart), then why couldn't he just create humans *first* with total immunity to death and without the ability to feel negative emotions in open space?

Him creating the animals first makes no sense whatsoever. For a creator whose goal is to create something *of his own image*, why would he start off with a *lion* or a *serpent* than start off with a *human*? He is very *tribal* about it, seeming to allow us to cause the suffering of his *other* creations by hunting/killing/farming them. He *rewards* his followers and *brings judgment* against their enemies. He gave his people the land of milk and honey. He gave that jerk-off Pharoah some desert pyramids and an ass-whooping back to the harsh desert from whence he came. He *wanted* these people to be happy because they are on *his* team. Yes; God is very tribal. He specifically chose *us* to love, but he specifically chose to make us *last*? This doesn't make *any* sense with the God's tribal character trait that is thoroughly described in Biblical text. Why not make us first and just interact with us as he made everything else?

Who is this character? Who is this God that Christians follow?

Reddit, I need a serious change of view. Otherwise, I could never take a Christian seriously, which would detriment my personal relationships with my Christian friends. So please. Change my view.


Edit: 

u/kilkil:
>To the best of my understanding, the purpose of religious faith is not factual correctness, but emotional fulfillment. The logical inconsistency of religious faith is, in a way, similar to the logical inconsistency of an irrational hope, or to that of a dream. That is to say, it's there, but it doesn't matter that it's there.

>The other thing to consider is that, despite official statements to the contrary, in the case of most people, their personal faith isn't actually the same thing as believing everything in the Bible is 100% true. That is, their religion may say so, and they may themselves believe that they believe everything in the Bible, but for the purposes of examining logical inconsistencies, it's an important distinction.


I seriously didn't expect such great answers to come in so early! This definitely changed my view, and outlook on Christianity. Christians aren't inherently fools - they simply exercise their human capacity to be invested in something with *emotional* value. My friends are definitely *smarter* than I am in many ways, so I understand that they can be rational. Their irrational indulgence isn't something to be shamed, but an indicator that they *can be human*. This was a very fast CMV. Thanks u/kilkil!

Edit 2 : Alright guys! Thank you all for your lovely responses. I mean no offense. I do not mean to nor have I insulted you. I genuinely appreciate the response. But I will have to stop responding and place my attention elsewhere. My stoned mind demands other content. Whether you are Christian or Atheist, I am just happy that we can coexist peacefully!

CMV: Prisons should be about helping criminals become normal people rather than being about revenge.,3198,330,2019-01-17 04:13:56,"Alright so before I get into the actual post, I feel as if I should clarify a few things. 
1. This is my first time posting. 
2. I am not American so feel free to call me out if I get anything wrong. (I'm European)
3. I'm here to learn, okay. The point of this post if to see if my opinion is flawed, not to prove that my opinion is perfect. 
4. Sorry for my writing.

So I think that prisons should be about helping criminals become integrated into society. In my opinion, I feel like there would be a much lower crime rate in the US if instead of treating prisoners badly, they were treated nicely. That guards talk to them and mental health experts too. If you can convince prisoners to stop doing crimes and live like others instead, you are basically eliminating crime.

 In my opinion, if I was in prison, then got let out, I'd be much more likely to stop doing crimes if I was treated nicely. While I do understand this would mean we would have to spend alot more on prisoners, I feel like this would greatly increase the safety of the people. Just like spending money on the military makes citizens safer, so would lowering the amount of criminals in the country. 

My main point:

Prisoners should not be treated in a way that causes anger. I believe that the reason that the American system does this is revenge. They treat them badly because they have treated others badly. In my opinion, this should not be the way it works. I believe that you should not treat them badly. If a person who has been bad it doesn't mean that they cant be lead on the right track. I believe that all you need to do is help them. In my opinion, prisoners should be treated in a way that allows them to become a new person. There should be mental health professionals who can get them on the right path. People who can teach them things so they can get a job. Companies should be paid to hire some of the prisoners who have had good behaviour and are good at that thing.  Of course this won't work with everyone, but it will most likely help atleast a little. 

I also feel as if a prisoner seems chill and generally a better person, they could be let out. Of course this would probably not realistically be possible, as most likely this would cause lots of cases where people would be exploiting the system. But I'd still like to know if there is anything wrong with that idea other than what I just addressed.

I also feel that the cells need to be improved. While I don't think they deserve what a normal citizen has, I think they definitely should atleast get something that makes them feel as if they're not in hell, but in a place to become a new person.

CMV: Mega threads are not a good place for any type of discussion,3201,130,2018-10-20 22:00:07,"Almost every sub has a “general discussion megathread” and every time I see it I find it useless. The thread gets too cluttered way too quickly, even in smaller subs. Furthermore, after a few strings, it’s impossible to start a discussion because of the clutter. In my experience you’d have to be one of the first posters to talk about anything you want to talk about. This is not a part of the cmv but I see very little use for megathreads outside of announcements. Even discussions on single topics quickly devolve into the equivalent of standing in a crowded party where everyone is trying to shout over each other.

I’ll be honest, I started this thread  after the umpteenth time I got my discussion thread deleted because “it belonged on general discussion”. You can change my mind if you can show me

One such commercial features a woman with a tracheo-oesophageal puncture(hole in neck) warning potential smokers that dating is hard in her condition. I beleive that the same route should be taken towards obesity. Junk food should come with a warning and a distasteful picture showing the effects of obesity. There should be commercials with obese or formerly obese people warning of how hard it is to date while obese. CMV

CMV: The Wakandans fight in a laughably unrealistic way,3187,429,2019-07-12 02:18:07,"This applies to Black Panther and other MCU movies they appear in.

They are a highly advanced civilization, they have force fields guarding the city, city wide camouflage, hovercrafts, nanoparticle technology, and loads of other sci fi tech.

When it comes time to fight, they line up in classic formations with swords, spears, antiquated ranged weapons, and shields. Then when the fighting occurs, they **break formation** and fight single handed melee style combat.

Guns? Artillery? Aircraft Support? How can they be so advanced but have tactics that would lose to Napolean? There weapons are enhanced, but they would get absolutely get clobbered by any modern army.  Surely they would do much better if they had guns?",1
"CMV: Lab-Grown Meat Technology Research Should be prioritized to help pave way for sustainable, scalable and more efficient production of proteins",3193,389,2018-12-26 22:16:58,"I have been hearing and reading a lot about culture grown meat and the potential it has to produce proteins such as chicken and beef. The meat grown in these labs are molecularly identical to that of its counter-part minus the process of slaughtering and processing the animal.

&#x200B;

I 've watched a [Wall Street Journal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjSe-0vSRMY) video and read a [WIRE](https://www.theweek.co.uk/96156/the-pros-and-cons-of-lab-grown-meat) article about the benefits and current advancements the lab-grown meat technology industry is starting to gain track. This technology could offer the potential to cut down on massive amounts of space needed to breed, grow, and slaughter the animals. It could conserve and decrease the time, energy, and CO2 emissions that are by-products of the current system in place to produce these foods. My last main argument is the scalability potential.

&#x200B;

If this tech was prioritized and funded I can see a more sustainable agriculture future for humanity.

&#x200B;

**Edit(s)**

&#x200B;

**1st:** Thank you guys so much for expressing your perspectives. I love looking at all the different viewpoints people have on this topic.  Hindsight is 20/20 and I wish I could change the last word in the article to **meats.**  I can see how proteins are can be interpreted as a wide variety from different independent sources

&#x200B;

What I'm trying to say is I believe we should prioritize (NOT TOP PRIORITY) research for this method in order to make advancements for this technology which would help shorten the gap between the way the industry currently obtains meat.

&#x200B;

**2nd:** To CMV, please explain a reasonable alternate solution that we should prioritize to the way industry produces meat that is less environmentally impactful, more scalable, and more reliable than the current process industry uses to produce meat

CMV: Terrorism in the US is not a big deal and Trump's ban will have no impact on it,3182,818,2017-01-29 23:33:27,"A lot of people have been bringing up that ""the countries on Trump's ban aren't the ones that have people who killed Americans in terrorist acts in the US."" Which is valid. But I'd go even further: America doesn't have a terrorism problem. There's around an average of [10 deaths](https://www.start.umd.edu/pubs/START_AmericanTerrorismDeaths_FactSheet_Oct2015.pdf) from terrorism in the US per year. How low could we possibly get that in a country with more guns than people?

Even assuming a diffuse probability in Muslims having a certain chance to commit these acts (which again, is not the case), that is a 10/[3.3 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_the_United_States)=0.0003%  chance that any given Muslim will kill someone through terrorism. And if you stopped all Muslim immigration (which this ban is not even doing), that would decrease your chance of death from terrorism by 0.0003%*[50,000](http://www.pewforum.org/2013/05/17/the-religious-affiliation-of-us-immigrants/)=15%. So around 1 more death from terrorism a year.

And this is ignoring the possible increase in terrorism from growing animosity, problems with relations between countries, the deaths of refugees that we don’t help, etc.

EDIT: Not exactly the change I thought might happen, but it turns out that the ban might actually increase the risk of terrorism due to alienation. I said ""Trump's ban will have no impact on it"". It very well could have an impact. Just probably not the direction we'd like.

CMV: Suspects physical appearance and name should be hidden from those who judge them in court,3181,234,2020-07-12 09:12:56,"I think the American justice system (and any country, but I'm thinking in the US as the prime example for this) could be better if the jury/judges don't know the identity (appearance and name) of the suspect. He or She would be assigned a code name (or number i.e. suspect 1453) and details of his identity would be revealed only when necessary (i.e. suspected of murdering his/her father).

This measure would benefit those that are allegedly usually discriminated in the judicial system (i.e. African Americans). There are many examples of these cases of unfair treatment circulating on the internet and I think this would eliminate (partially) our, sometimes natural, prejudice when presented with accusations like robbery, murder or else. 



I'm willing to change my view if someone shows me some decent arguements either against my position or in favor of revealing the ID of the suspect. CMV

"CMV: We should give tropical systems (Hurricanes, Tropical Storms, etc.) more menacing names because then, people may start to take them more seriously.",3178,334,2019-09-20 22:55:21,"I'm from the Houston area, and we recently suffered the wrath of Tropical Storm IMELDA. 

Now, I know this may seem stupid when compared to more serious topics that are often discussed on this subreddit, but hear me out. 

When is the last time you met someone threatening named IMELDA?

I know this is purely psychological, but why not give tropical systems more threatening names like ""Vader"", ""Stalin"", ""Adolf"", or ""Cthulhu"". 

I feel like people living along the southern coasts would at least begin to think about evacuating to seek shelter if HURRICANE DRAGO was about to make landfall.  Maybe giving these storms more menacing names would be a good first step in helping people take these things more seriously. Especially if the planet is warming, and we'll begin to see more of these things over the next 10-20 years. 

Tell me why I'm wrong about this.


***UPDATE***

So, wow. Didn't expect this post to blow up the way it did. 

Anyways, consider my view changed on this one. 

I came to the conclusion that in order for Hurricane Updates and Tracking to be effective, we need to be able to name and track storms with ease, and they're just aren't enough MENACING names to go around that are both easy to pronounce while still striking fear into the hearts of others (in regards to where I reside: Texas). 

And even then, while I may find Hurricane Santa Anna menacing in Texas (yes, this is a joke), those who reside in Florida or the East Coast may have no clue who that historical figure is. Not to mention, there is no guarantee all Americans directly threatened by tropical systems are Star Wars fans, let alone LTOR fans, Harry Potter Fans, etc. 

So naming things ""Lord Voldermort"" or ""Sauron"" is also pointless. 

Instead, I want to adopt a suggestion user TiVO25 posted below. We redo the classification / catergory system. We can still keep 1 through 5, but here are my recommendations:

* Category 1 &gt; Rug Burn
* Category 2 &gt; Anal Fissure
* Category 3 &gt; Ball Crusher
* Category 4 &gt; Cthulu
* Category 5 &gt; Explosive Ass Cancer 

I feel that should do the trick. 

And if none of this makes sense, I was really just bored this AM, as I was waiting for my dog to take a dump, while I was reading an article about TS Imelda and thought to myself ""Man, that is a very non-threatening name. We can do better than that.""",1

How it actually is that 55 is the minimum speed drivers typically drive 55-65 and anyone going 50 will be viewed as going to slow and an unsafe driver.

Yet a cop can and will issue tickets for going 5-10 over the speed limit which realistically means they can pull over 50%+ of all drivers at basically any time to give out tickets.

There are 3 lane roads in my area with a speed limit of 25 that should realistically be driven at 40-50 mph safely.

CMV: Personal lifestyle choice to reduce carbon emmisions have no impact on climate change and are counterproductive to coming up with real solutions that can be implemented for everyone,3146,413,2019-09-03 22:04:12,"I don't think this whole push towards living a ""greener"" lifestyle through personal choice to reduce your carbon footprint is an effective way to combat climate change.  There are wayyy too many people unable or unwilling unwilling to make the changes necessary to live sustainably off a society fundamentally based on fossil fuel energy.

It doesn't matter if you take shorter showers, go vegetarian, turn your heat down during the winter etc etc when so much of our lives outside of our own control are based on fossil fuels. The roads we drive on, the water we drink, the food we eat, the metals in our appliances, electronics,and infrastructure, the lumber that makes our homes/workspaces, all are derived or produced using fossil fuels (nevermind transportation and electricity).

 There are so many people living in poverty or barely making ends meet that don't have the luxury of going to the local farmers market to ""buy local"", voluntarily paying a higher electric bill to support renwables, or biking to work instead of commuting because they can't afford to live a couple miles down the road from their office (or dont work in an office and have to drive to constantly changing job sites instead).  These things are only accessible for the most privileged of us and are not real solutions to these issues, they simply take away resources from real solutions to these problems.

The only way I see the world moving forward is to make renewables as cheap and reliable as fossil fuels.  Car manufacturers need to release reliable and inexpensive electric cars, trucks, and public transport.  Governments and industry need to invest massive amounts of money into developing solar/wind plus storage solutions that are as reliable and inexpensive as natural gas.  These are the only solutions that can actually be implemented worldwide to combat carbon emissions.  Otherwise, we will simply end up with western democracies and China half heartedly investing in a more expensive electric grid while the rest of the world continues to burn coal, natural gas, and oil.",1

CMV: Australia's government (and in turn others) are right to be concerned about child sexualisation in anime. Change needs to happen.,3124,368,2020-02-27 20:19:09,"As much as I love to shit on the ignorance and xenophobia of Australian parliament, a recent meme-worthy case came up in the last couple of days in which senators discussed, in the middle of Australian parliament, the nature of paedophilic (yes, that's how we spell is) imagery and themes in the anime series *No Game No Life* and *Eromanga Sensei*. 

As much as the mention of anime in such a high place is funny, there really is no falsity in what is said. These series do sexualise young girls in ways adults (the target audience of many of these series) have absolutely no healthy reason to enjoy. 

I watch a significant amount of anime myself, but I and the people who I enjoy it with always feel significantly less okay with what we watch when a scene of a teenage boy being groped by his D-cup-sporting ten-year-old sister comes up. Nobody likes it (or at least I hope not), yet we put up with it because so few modern series are without this content in some form of another. If it's not misogyny, incest *and* paedophilia, it's usually at least one of the three. 

Anime is not small in Australia at all. Melbourne alone has four conventions (recently merged to create three) conventions per year centring on anime and manga. People like it here, and in a country where paedophilia has never not been an issue, there is good reason to be wary of this content.

Now at risk of sounding like I'm backtracking, **I do not believe in censoring the content given**. People will always find ways around any restrictions placed, demonstrated well with the ban on the game *Hotline Miami 2*'s release (thanks Humble Bundle), however I do believe there needs to be an official, powerful effort made to reduce the acceptability of paedophilic content's acceptance in any respectful society. If other countries joined in, content of the anime and manga industries may care enough to be more respectful with their content - producers of One Punch Man relied on its western reception to justify a second season, and if American distributors had cared about the actual content of their media, changes may have been required to the [series' concerning depiction of adolescent-appearing women](https://66.media.tumblr.com/953d1bc358edf925fa1c43d233968e9a/tumblr_pqbvvrUHY21s307p6o2_r1_540.png).

CMV: Prison rape jokes are disgusting and not funny,3118,453,2020-09-23 09:13:47,"This belief partially started from when I asked a theoretical question [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/iwl6sd/if_american_college_students_were_arrested_for/) about how would college students arrested for underage drinking be treated in jail (since people often talk about what crime you commit determines your treatment in jail and underage drinking is an arrestable offense in many places). 

The responses include comments like [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/iwl6sd/if_american_college_students_were_arrested_for/g60to21/) and [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/iwl6sd/if_american_college_students_were_arrested_for/g60tq4l/), which were both rape jokes. 

These comments also show both how American culture believes that prison rape is frequently a laughing matter and how disgusting prison rape jokes are. Such jokes are disgusting because it makes being sexually assaulted in prison something that should be expected or normal as such abuse is not taken seriously. This stems from the problem that people treat inmates in prison as people who are lesser beings who deserve zero respect. The fact is we are all humans. If it is not funny for your neighbor to be abused, the same should apply to people in prison. 

In addition, such jokes aren't funny because they are flat out ignorant and gross. In the example comments I talked about above, both of them are comments that joke about college students being treated as sexual objects in jail. It is not funny for someone to be treated as a sexual object. These jokes are also flat out wrong because the question had to do with jail and not prison, and such sexual abuse is rare in jail. Someone arrested for drugs or alcohol would not be treated poorly in jail or prison. These jokes make it impossible to reform the system because people are so used to being ignorant of reality due to popularity of such jokes.",1
CMV: You should be able to enjoy life while working hard rather than after.,3109,144,2020-02-15 01:50:22," Many hear and often preach the phrase “Work hard, play hard,” but we also hear the importance of maintaining a “work-life balance.”

What is the perfect “work-life balance?” Does this mean continuously maintaining a 9-to-5 job and being able to spend quality time with loved ones afterward? Does this mean getting 8 hours of sleep, attending all classes, participating in extracurriculars and leaving time to take care of yourself? And is this definition of a work-life balance realistic? According to [research](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/only-the-overworked-die-young-201512148815) from the Harvard Medical School, it was found that working more than 55 hours per week significantly raises the risk of heart attack and stroke, and these individuals are more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression, in addition to loss of sleep. Loss of sleep can be easily perpetuated if hard work and maintaining other responsibilities of life are prioritized.  

Work hard, play hard usually implies that one should spend an abundance of effort in their work and maintain a hard-working mindset until success is reached. But then I raise the question: what is success? How do you know when you reach it? Especially for myself, it’s very easy to get lost in the busyness of life and forget to enjoy life for what it has to offer. But then I wonder, when do you know you should “play hard?” Do I deserve to enjoy myself when I have an abundance of work to do? 

Though both “work hard, play hard” and “work-life balance” seemingly conflict in meaning, I believe that a combination of the two meanings is the best way to go about life. I think being successful in your work means putting quality effort to learn from your experiences every day, rather than simply attaining some professional/work-related goal. And by doing so, we can create time to let loose and in a sense, celebrate ourselves for being productive in our daily lives. Thus, this balanced mindset to life is working hard and playing hard in sync. 

If one just continues to work hard in hopes of playing hard in the distant future, they may never reap the fruits they sow, never pause to appreciate that life has more to offer than just working (school or a job), or at least give their mind and body a break from life. On the flip side, if you always go out and don’t prioritize productivity and working, how can you sustain a life for yourself? How can you contribute to society and make your life meaningful?

This is why I think we should at least try and maintain both aspects of life at the same time. Is there a better alternative to this mindset?",1
CMV: Liberals should abandon identity politics and instead focus on class/economic issues,3105,1260,2017-10-12 22:02:04,"Identity Politics (IP) is largely unhelpful and extremely divisive. The focus on identity by liberals alienates other people on the left and creates huge distance from those in the middle and those on the right. Class/economic issues, such as wealth inequality and ending crony capitalism, are far more unifying messages for those who hold liberal ideology. Alleviating class/economic issues would also have downstream positive impact on many other issues (often championed by IP) such as racial inequality.

Proponents of IP get caught up too often in the characteristics of the individuals making political arguments – practically by design. The speaker therefore is weighted according to inherent traits they happened to be born with (race, gender, sexual orientation). This creates an environment in which large portions of the population/electorate (i.e. straight, white, male) feel that their opinions and issues are valued less than others. The resulting atmosphere, exacerbated deliberately by right leaning talking points, causes many to abandon the left.

Class/economic issues should become the leading message for liberals, given the broader appeal it would naturally have. Discussing and championing issues of income distribution/poverty/corruption would reach a much larger population and could pull many in the middle and on the right back toward the left. This would not only be practically useful for political reasons, but would also have a net positive impact on many of the class-related social issues that we see in society.

"CMV: The logic that beastiality is wrong because ""animals cannot consent to sex"" makes no sense at all. We should just admit it's illegal because it's disgusting.",3111,824,2019-08-29 12:36:01,"Gross post warning

I'm not sure if it's even in the law that it's illegal because ""animals can't consent,"" but I often hear people say that's why it's wrong. But it seems a little ridiculous to claim animals can't consent.

Here's an example. Let's say a silverback gorilla forces a human to have sex with it, against the human's will. The gorilla rapes the human. But what happens if suddenly, the human changes their mind and consents. Is the human suddenly raping the gorilla, because the gorilla cannot consent? If the human came back a week later and the same event occured, but the human consents at the begining this time, did the human rape the gorilla? 

I think beastiality should be illegal ONLY because it disgusts me, as ridiculous as that sounds. No ethical or moral basis to it. And to protect animals from *actually* getting raped by humans, which certainly happens unfortunately.",1
CMV: A company going public inevitably will sacrifice its humanity and become inherently concerned about money only,3105,371,2018-10-11 09:30:32,"I work for a very humanist company with strong environmental, equality and respect values. It's apparent in the way it treats its employees, and how it conducts business. These values will sometimes drive decisions that lead to less profit, but more employees and management satisfaction.

Right now, there are approximately 30 investors in the company, and with such a small number, it's easy to get them on board with our values because we can have a face-to-face conversation.

However, the company is starting to plan an IPO and I fear that this will be the moment that it becomes like any other large company and investment funds: all decisions will be motivated by money alone. This would mean the end, or at least very near the end, of the social aspect of the company.

I'm hoping I'm wrong, but the discussions I had thus far only seem to reinforce my current fear and opinion.  Can you change my view?

**Edit:**

Thank you for the responses. I came here in a state of fear, and I stand now with valuable leads to investigate, namely the legal (and exchanges) requirements for profit making and share retention, and alternative markets and b-corps. I therefore consider this CMV a success.

I wish I had created a less biased exposition of my situation to begin with. A better CMV statement should've looked something like /u/melodyze's suggestion: ""Public investment creates an incentive structure that tends to erode the values of the company and move the company to only focusing on the common denominator of financials"". However, I'm neither well-spoken or smart enough to come up with such a beautifully-crafted statement, so thank you to the people who took time to reply constructively with facts regardless of the absolute tone of my post.",1

That opinion isn’t changing. The discussion at hand is that traditional debating and politicking didn’t win the last election and won’t win the next so long as Trumps media dominance holds strong.

CMV: Getting a tax refund is not a good thing and people should file their taxes differently if they are receiving gigantic returns,3091,416,2020-01-17 10:08:14,"In my opinion, getting a tax refund just means you gave the government an interest free loan. People are always saying ""Oh I got $4k in taxes how great is that"" but in actuality you could have had an extra $75 each paycheck if you are paid weekly, thats approx $300 a month lost to overpaying the government. 

Even if you didn;t need an additional $300 a month, you could have invested that money in literally any other way and you would get more return on it, resulting in more overall money. 

I file my taxes in a way that I owe about $100-$200 this way Im the one getting the loan.  Am I the crazy one here?",1
"CMV: Kneeling During the National Anthem is not Disrespectful to America, Veterans, or Really Anyone at All",3085,487,2020-08-03 12:36:01,"For a little background, this is a topic my view has been evolving on for some time. When professional athletes first started kneeling during the national anthem a few years ago, my opinion was more along the lines of ""I respect your right to peacefully protest, but I disagree with your actions and find them disrespectful to veterans who fought and died to give us the freedoms we have today.""

While I still have the utmost respect for our veterans, (I personally know a more than a couple veterans and have seen first-hand the toll it takes on them and their families) I now think the idea that simply taking a knee during the national anthem is somehow disrespectful to them or the country as a whole is misguided.

For one, there are far more disrespectful things a person could do during the anthem than kneeling. Would it not be a more disrespectful, yet equally peaceful protest for someone to turn their back to flag during the anthem, or to try to shout over it? Even more those more disrespectful measures would be protected by the first amendment rights to the freedom of speech and the freedom to peacefully assemble and petition the government for a redress of grievances, so why the uproar over simply kneeling?

Secondly, why should kneeling be considered disrespectful at all? For a personal example (but one that should be familiar to most anyone who has watched or participated in team sports in America at any level of competition), I played (American) football all the way through junior high and high school. Whenever a player on either team was injured, every player on both teams, whether on the field or the sideline, would take a knee until that player left the field. In that context, kneeling was a sign of respect. This may be getting a little metaphorical, but I don't believe it's a stretch to say that our country is injured right now. Should it not be a sign of respect to kneel for our injured country?

Edit: Apologies for the messy delta-ing. Couldn't get a well-deserved one to go through. Pretty sure I got it straightened out.",1
CMV: It is hypocritical to criticize liberals for politicizing school shootings while using the Mollie Tibbets murder to argue for increased border security,3077,805,2018-08-22 21:55:43,"Every time there is a school shooting in America, Democrats make an argument for increased gun control. Conservatives and conservative media come out and criticize democrats for being heartless. They say it is wrong to politicize a tragedy so quickly after it happens.  

But with the announcement that Mollie Tibbets was murdered by an undocumented immigrant, Republicans are making no delay in using it to push for increased border security. /r/the_donald had a post with 7.3k upvotes on their front page calling for ""Mollies wall"". Politicians were politicizing it last night. The comments section of any news article politicize it. Conservative twitter accounts too

Im not saying its wrong to  politicize tragedies. I am saying you are a hypocrite if you are using this tragedy to justify building a wall, but criticize liberals for using school shooting to justify increased gun control

"CMV: Using Phrases Such as ""White Tears"" is Inflammatory and Counterproductive to Social Liberalism",3074,639,2018-04-28 22:21:56,"For Context: I am not white. I am of Afro-Latino descent.

I'm very socially liberal and support the empowerment of minorities in a system that was designed to benefit white individuals. Racism is alive and well today, and there's much work that still needs to be done with deconstructing racist elements from within our societal institutions.

That said, I feel that there is an incredible disconnect as to how activist POC communicate with not just white activists, but activists in general. Many have begun to operate under the notion that because societal power in America naturally benefits the white man, it is impossible to be prejudiced against whites. I usually here the ""you can't be racist against whites"", which is a fundamental misunderstanding of the sociological theory they derived that notion from (individual prejudice still exists).

It's become increasingly popular in my field (academia-student affairs) to begin wearing shirts such as, ""Sipping on White Tears"", or, ""White is Wrong"". Personally, I've grown incredibly uncomfortable with my colleagues because of this.

I believe it to be inflammatory, and generalizing all white people into a singular unit is significantly lacks much needed nuance. I feel that activists hurt themselves by alienating white people based off my anecdotal experience.

CMV: Mass shootings are a poor justification for gun control,3067,1694,2019-08-08 00:13:07,"My concern is that mass shootings get more attention from the gun control movement than they objectively deserve, and this distracts from the kind of regulations that would reduce gun murders.

1. Mass shootings get a lot of attention in the news media because they are exciting. But they don't actually kill that many people  (e.g. in 2017, [117 people died in mass shootings](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/) out of [14,542 total gun murders](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/homicide.htm) = 0.8%).
2. The pathology of mass shootings is atypical. They are mostly carried out by lone individuals who have spent some time stockpiling weapons and building themselves up to carry out a fantasy of destruction against some institution or group. There is an eerie impersonality to their violence: the particular people they kill are just extras in the screenplay they are trying to produce. (This may be what makes mass shootings so upsetting - they can happen to anyone, even nice middle-class white people minding their own business in the mall.)
3. In contrast most gun violence takes place within poor, badly policed, gang-ridden \[Edited to add: ethnic minority\] neighborhoods in parts of cities like Detroit and Chicago. It tends to be much more personal and is mostly carried out with illegally owned handguns, not legally owned AR-15s.
4. Focusing so much on mass shootings makes it seem that if only we could stop (the wrong) people from getting hold of AR-15s we would reduce gun violence by a lot. It wouldn't.
5. Focusing so hard on which guns people who follow the laws should be allowed to buy really pisses off the community of gun owners (who are less likely than the average population to commit crimes). That makes it harder than it ought to be to build a political consensus for effective gun control. \[Edit there are millions of AR-15s in legal ownership but very very few get used for mass murder\]
6. Effective gun control isn't just about laws (most guns that kill people are already illegal) but policies that implement them. e.g. national database of gun buyers to prevent straw buyers funnelling guns into cities, and also better funded detective squads so that gun murderers get punished (some US cities now have only a 35% clear up rate). That's what the gun control movement should focus on.

Edit: Thanks for taking the time to challenge my view. I maintain the broad outlines, but I was persuaded to add a lot more nuance. I posted the result [here](https://www.philosophersbeard.org/2019/08/mass-shootings-are-poor-justification.html).",1
CMV: Jason Bourne is the best spy.,3062,355,2020-06-20 01:15:44,"Out of the 3 largest modern spy series: 007 (James Bond), Bourne (Jason Bourne) & Mission  Impossible (Ethan Hunt), Bourne undoubtedly is the best spy of them all. 

Throughout his trilogy, Jason has not revived any sanctioned help from his organization (CIA). Bond often gets support from his (MI6) and Hunt as well (IMF). 

Bond & Hunt have received sanctioned help, gadgets and support teams. Bourne is usually on his own or with a single individual helping him out occasionally. 

All three spies do have a diverse ability set. Bond and Hunt do see you have Bourne beat when it comes to flying, but when it comes to land vehicles, they all are well versed. 

Bourne is the only one of them who has not gotten captured. Craig’s Bond has gotten caught at least twice and Hunt had his ass beat by (then) John Clark and would have died if not for back up. 

Bourne has evaded capture at every turn and has not lost a fight (after the start of the series). 


So change my mind that Bond or Hunt does their job better than Bourne.

I’m willing to also talk about other contenders but I am mainly looking at the top 3. I considered including Jack Ryan in the discussion.",1
CMV: Mass shootings in the US are a greater national emergency than illegal immigration (the reason for the wall),3061,713,2019-01-31 07:19:38,"Forgive me if this post is out of line or not properly formatted. I have not been to this sub. I saw a meme on the facebooks today that proclaimed

- 4 dead, one injured in Rockmart Georgia, January 24; suspect: 27-yo male, arrested.  
- 4 dead, one injured in State College Pennsylvania, January 24; subject: 21-yo male, died by self-inflicted.

CMV: We need to change the way the world views pedophilia: in the sense that we need to view the problem as an illness rather than a purposeful crime.,3056,732,2017-11-04 16:28:33,"My basis on this argument is that pedophilia is as much an illness as your depression or other mental disorder.

A lot of people who are sexually attracted to children don't choose to be. It is simply how they feel and have zero control over it.

I have come over several people online who have had sexual attraction to underage kids and feel like monsters, they hate themselves for it and how they even could have thoughts like these. (This is however anecdotal, yet I feel like it sets the basis of my opinion.)

These people would never admit these feelings out of fear of being an outcast. Families and friends would avoid them, they would find it hard to get jobs and would be treated like monsters. If they felt it was safe to be honest about these feelings without the fear of becoming ostracised than maybe they would come forward more often to seek help.

If hidden and not dealt with, these emotions could result in using child pornography or even sexually abusing a child themselves.

The reason we classify things as mental disorders is because it does not fit our societal expectations or understandings.

It is the same reason that homosexuality was seen as abnormal and deemed as a mental illness and it wasn't that long ago that transgenderism was seen as another mental illness.

These people need to be seen as humans and helped before they do something they will regret.

I have been meaning to make this post for a while but felt it seemed fitting now with Kevin Spacey's allegations coming into light.

Could this all have been prevented if he got the necessary help in the first place? I don't know, but I would like to think it would be a step in the right direction.

End point: pedophilia is an illness and should be treated as such, not a purposeful desire to harm.

CMV: 1-Ply is inferior to 2-Ply toilet paper and shouldn’t exist.,3054,256,2020-08-08 09:07:38,"
Disclaimer: This is my one crackpost for the month and I apologize in advance. 

I know. It’s an odd thing to get a little stuck on, but I’ve found myself thinking about this for the past few nights. 

Although the “Folding” versus “Wadding” community is nearly even, folding tends to be the one that stays in a constant lead. With this in mind, I have a few reasons that I believe 1-ply toilet paper is absolute trash. 

1-ply toilet paper is very thin. This thinness normally makes it horrible for absorbency and easy to tear, which can lead to more toilet paper being pulled in the bathroom. I would estimate that you would pull 4 1-ply sheets for every 2 2-ply sheets. 

To correlate with my first thought, if you’re going through 1-ply paper at a quicker rate than you would 2-ply paper then you are paying extra money for worst services. Would you pay $10 every week for a new pack of paper or $10 biweekly for a new pack of paper?

Very FEW 1-ply toilet papers are a good quality. If you’re buying 1-ply for cheapness, you probably aren’t buying name brand, which means you might as well be stealing toilet paper from the sketchy gas station down the street. 

The only positive I have heard about 1-ply toilet paper is that it is less likely to clog your septic system. I would state that this could even out that cost value; however, I’ve also heard that toilet paper clogging the septic system is a myth as toilet paper’s main purpose is to go into the septic system after waste cleanup. Most toilet papers are tested for septic safety before they are marketed. 

Lastly, this is more of a personal thing, but as a lady, I’ve got to wipe three times (urine, feces, period mess) as much as a dude and would much rather prefer quality over quantity. I don’t know if dudes will be able to empathize or understand the horror of possibly getting all three of those bodily fluids/solids on my hand due to a worthless thinass sheet of toilet paper problem.",1
CMV: Left and right are outdated terms that no longer define the current ideological spectrum.,3055,243,2020-03-30 08:24:21,"Every generation that grows and becomes politically active, goes further away of the classic left and right definitions, and mixing things of both sides is increasingly common. We still have polarized sides and one is clearly leaned to the left and the other to the right, but I feel this words no longer encapsulate the real difference between both sides.
Each country has slightly different concepts of left and right, and probably most countries have two ""sides"" politically speaking. I'm my country, we have many political parties spreaded along the left - right spectrum, but as polarized politics are increasingly the norm, two sides end up against each other every time. And we join people of the same left or right tendency, because it's the reasoning we were taught to follow. But isn't there a better, modern view of what people really think and want this day and age? I really don't think that this definition helps, only worsens the polarization and ignorance.",1
CMV: Transgendered individuals have serious and legitimate mental problems and they deserve clinical help to reverse their dysmorphia.,3052,709,2020-04-11 21:49:24,"Being trans leads people to take extreme amounts of hormones, drastic measures, and mutilating surgery all to blend in as the gender that they would like to be and it's rarely successful. The rate of suicide and attempted suicide for these individuals is absurdly high, even after transitioning. They need actual help, not blind acceptance, as socially uncomfortable as that may make people. I believe that we, as a societal whole, are coming at this issue the wrong way and it's causing suffering. My half brother has been transitioning to a female for years now and he's always been horribly depressed, even now that he's been ""passable"" for some time.

That being said, you can live your life however you wish as long as it doesn't negatively impact anyone else, but there should at least be a viable solution for them to turn to.

Edit: mind changed. People are looking at the root cause, but haven't found a cure or a reason yet because the brain is immensely complicated and our current technology has only allowed researchers to move at current speads. The current treatments, as extreme as they seem to me, ease the suffering of trans individuals and shouldn't be ignored even if they aren't a 100% fix.",1
CMV: Rappers Shouldn’t Be Obsessed With Diamonds Considering Where Most Diamonds Come From,3053,319,2020-03-20 20:20:23,"First, I’d like to say I am a huge rap fan so I’m not coming at this idea as an outsider. I like flashy chains and designer clothes as well and I don’t think that materialism is the issue here, just the fact that most diamonds are mined by enslaved Africans. 

However, I think it’s interesting how rappers seem to be obsessed with diamonds and those same diamonds potentially come from their distant enslaved African relatives. Everyone knows how disgusting the diamond trade is in African and unless rappers like the Migos (who have, no exaggeration, probably 10 millions worth of diamonds between them) specifically source non slave trade diamonds, I don’t get how this doesn’t impact them morally. If I can afford them one day, I’ll probably have a nice classy diamond necklace or something because I like jewelry too but I’m going to ensure those diamonds didn’t come from African slaves. 

I hope nothing I said was offensive and I’m interested in what you guys have to say about it. I feel like this is something that has’t been posted on here before.

Edit: I don’t mean to make it seem like all rappers are African American. More so, Rap was originated by very conscious African Americans and I would expect any race rapper to respect African and African American culture and not want to partake in anything negatively contributing to Africa, or anywhere a historically oppressed people come from.

Conclusion: I thank everyone who responded with thought out and educated responses. I did learn a bunch and awarded deltas to those with good comments. However, to the PC easily triggered white people, the racist accusations are pathetic. This was simply a post to discuss a thought, I’m not a racist, I don’t think Africans and American Black people are the same, I feel like anyone with a brain would have realized that. Just had to give a big FU to PC wannabe racist reddit vigilantes. Thanks again to those with good comments. My view on this has been changed. Peace!",1
CMV: There should be a 'No Wet Markets' agreement between nations,3047,375,2020-04-06 02:52:06,"Without having this stumble into any area of racism, I want to make it clear that I'm not focusing on any country.

If these wet markets are more dangerous than nuclear weapons, we should have an international treaty type of document that says no one will do business with any country where wet markets are legal and or permitted.

Without drawing any parallels to any other types of international documents, I just think we should make it very clear that these types of practices and lack of hygiene have international ramifications. 

I wish I had some historical references to show that doing something like this is highly effective but I can only think about the European dark ages and how they figured out that maybe not throwing shit and animal entrails everywhere was possibly causing all the problems. There was a Renaissance shortly after... so maybe this is our opportunity for an International Renaissance?  

Please.... let's not get racist about this.

edit: As pointed out by several users, after posting this I realized I shouldn't have been so narrow towards wet markets and probably should have said unsanitary or unsafe food practices that would also cover things like overcrowded cow and pig farms etc.

"CMV: It's 2020, so there's no excuse anymore for popular apps to not be available on both iOS AND android phones.",3037,330,2020-01-20 02:39:35,"I believe that if an app developer has an app on the App Store, they should also work towards releasing that app on the google play store as well. Obviously if there's a specific reason it's only meant for iOS, then fine. If the app isn't popular enough for it to make sense for them to spend the money to develop the app, then fine. 10 or so years ago it was super common for apps to only be on the App Store. As someone who grew up with android, I felt cheated out of certain apps or games I wanted. 

Thankfully, it's become easier in the past decade to create apps and release them to the public. For the most part, apps do have both apple and android versions. However, there are still apps that are only available on iOS that I would like to download (e.g. Procreate) and it just doesn't make sense at this point. 

also: please no comments about whether apple or android are ""superior"" or whatever. both phones have pros and cons.

EDIT: have awarded deltas based on the concept of ""opportunity cost"" between iPhones and androids, and on the concept that android tablets arent nearly as popular as iPads. My view has not completely been changed. However, a new take that I have is that even if Procreate doesn't make an app for android tablets, they could release a version of Procreate Pocket for android phones, which are about as popular as apple phones. OR another option I'd accept is for them to release a version for windows (due to the wide availability of touch screen laptops from them). 

EDIT #2: a lot of comments are from solo/small developers who say that it would be difficult for them to personally make an app for both platforms. that's understandable. my post is more about the larger app companies whose job it is to create/maintain apps. hope that cleared things up.

EDIT #3: someone brought to my attention that the specific company I am talking about in my example (Savage Interactive) is not as big of a company as some sources I've seen make it seem. I awarded a delta to them because I can see why it may take more effort to produce an app for multiple platforms if there aren't many people. they only have 17, but I still think it's a project they should work towards due to the popularity of the app. also they say on their site they are hiring, which means they are looking for more team members and can afford to hire more. imo they should hire people who have android or windows experience.

CMV: when the woke left dismiss people like Joe Rogan and call him alt-right it turns more moderate left people away because they know that isn't true.,3020,2154,2019-12-05 01:14:44,"I have noticed there is a lot terrible things said about Rogan because he platforms these people. I also know Rogan has a huge audience and they're not just a bunch of crazy alt-righters. When you hear Joe talk about his own views he actually sits very left of center. 

It's seems to me that when people dismiss Joe and label him this way it makes a lot of his audience (who knows where he actually stands) think that these people are overreacting and are too extreme. Point being that by doing this they are actually hurting their cause and excluding many people they actually agree with, making less people support the rest of their ideas. 

Obviously there are more examples that could be used, but I felt Rogan was a good place to start since he does have a massive audience.

"CMV I would rather vote for a third party candidate that is closer to my political standings rather than ""the lesser of two evils""",3011,1053,2016-07-25 20:49:02,"When I registered to vote at 18, I registered as a democrat without being fully aware of what the party platform was, and its recent history. I knew I agreed with democrats more than republicans, and decided I was a democrat. I'm 24 now, and have learned a lot since then. I have also realized since then that I am very far left of the Democratic party.

Democracy should be about having a voice for your opinions, and having a two party system keeps many people voting for what they would consider the lesser of two evils instead of voting for someone they actually agree with. I'm far left of the Democratic party, and think Hillary Clinton is doing a lot of things I find morally wrong. I have read through her website multiple times, and disagree with a lot of what she wants to do and why she wants to do it.

Donald Trump seems like he would be a horrible president, and is way too vague when it comes to what he wants to do. Even with the vagueness, I strongly disagree with his plans if he becomes the president. 

Democracy in the US has been a two party system for almost its entire history, and I think that's horrible. I'm far left of both parties and would rather vote my conscious with someone that has a political stance closer to mine. 


Most people's argument against this is ""but imagine TRUMP as president!!"" Yes, I agree that would not be a good thing, but I also feel that Hillary would not represent me or my beliefs. Although I would consider Hillary Clinton as the lesser of two evils (only by a little), she is still far right of what I would want in my president.

CMV: Net neutrality will never be truly & permanently protected until it is recognized as a basic civil liberty in the US.,3004,274,2017-12-15 00:28:04,"With the FCC expected to repeal net neutrality, I began thinking about the incredible harm this could do, and what our options even are in the face of this decision. Was this somehow inevitable or could we have taken steps to prevent it? Once it is officially decided, will there be any way to reverse it? Even if we do reverse this attempt, what will stop them from trying this again in a few years? I came to the conclusion that the only way net neutrality will be entirely and permanently protected is if it is recognized as a basic civil liberty, and therefore is protected by the Constitution. This is a sad thought, however, because it seems very difficult and unlikely to get that kind of ruling (basically a constitutional amendment). Is there any other way? ",1

Simply put, the dude was paid more for being next to useless and as result, guess who was coming with a good solution? The employees in the team. Who was taking most of the credit?

"CMV: Bitcoin's value is strictly backed by the idea that the next person will pay more for it (greater fool theory), not because it is a finite and decentralized currency.",3000,447,2017-11-30 12:22:20,"Hello Reddit, as the title states I am a firm believer that bitcoin has no value other than the idea that the next person will pay more for it. I myself invested quite a lot into bitcoin and was successful in paying off all my student loans thanks to this, so I should be happy about bitcoin's popularity, but as I see more and more friends investing I am worried they don't fully grasp what they are getting into. I invested with the thought in mind that my investment had no actual value, but would increase because people would think it had value. However, other investors I speak to seem to invest because they think bitcoin itself has value, but I just don't see it. My worry is that this rumor based investing is getting out of hand and will eventually result in greater economic consequences when bitcoin crashes, taking the savings of the many ignorant investors down with it. 

Reasons I do not think it has value:

* not widely accepted enough to use in day to day transactions (arguable)

* fluctuation in value negates any use as currency 

* liquidation can take 2-3 weeks 

* Defined as currency, yet treated like an asset.

CMV: The entire Commercial Air Travel business thrives on purposefully making your experience bad so that they can charge for upgrades.,2981,271,2019-12-23 21:42:09,"While most businesses become successful by creating good service and products - and getting paid for these good services and good products - the commercial airline industry seems to be trying to make money by creating the most miserable experience possible, and rewarding customers with slight comparable *conveniences* for paying additional money.

Even in industries where everything sucks, there is always an effort by other companies to make things better and to *compete* with others.  As far as airlines go, they all really suck, and no ones doing anything about it except for minuscule differences.

Consider the points below and tell me it doesn’t sound like someone maliciously just trying to inconvenience everyone for upgrade payments.  These inconveniences illustrate how something can easily be done to improve customer experience, yet years are going by with no change.

1.	All research suggests that even boarding passengers in random order is more efficient than the stupid grouping systems in place.  Yet, no company does anything about it.  They make you pay to upgrade your group zone number so that you can just sit on the plane instead of the gate (and still wait the same amount of time).
2.	Aisles are only big enough for one person so everyone has to wait 30 mins to board and unboard.  I’m not an engineer, but making an aisle 2-people’s length instead of 1 does not destroy its aerodynamic abilities.
3.	They only have overhead compartment space for literally just 80% of people.  We’ve achieved safe ways to literally fly across the globe, but it’s impossible to load everyone’s bag?
4.	“customers” sit shoulder to shoulder with no room to stretch for 6+ hours
5.	bathrooms are so incredibly small that you can’t even extend your arms
6.	passengers need to climb over each other if they are not in an isle seat
7.	You get a bag of pretzels and a soda can instead of sandwiches or any other cheap food item
8.	WiFi is fast enough to load pages but not fast enough to be remotely worth it.
9.	cheap car seats are more comfortable than airline seats
9.	The suitcases are stored in a separate section of the plane, so entire building structures filled with carousels need to be made where wait times are up to an hour and bags get lost and customers need to go somewhere else to get them.

Airlines are not **competing** for business (apart from simply adding *two bags of pretzels* instead of one bag of pretzels). If an airline made an experience that doesn’t suck by implementing reasonable measures, it would run the competition out of business.  

Pumping gas isn’t fun, but at least gas stations put TV’s in the stations and add chips and drinks to make customers choose one over another.  Computers all used to suck before Apple came and made them desirable.  Where is the Apple of air travel?

Therefore, commercial air travel is *not* a service industry, they are a disservice industry with the added side effect of travel.

Edit: To clarify, experiences like first-class and airport lounges are great in comparison to not first class and standard gates.  However, the standard for everyone should just be similar to first class with a comfortable seat and some hot food.  It shouldn’t be a luxury.  Instead, they make the normal experience terrible just so that people upgrade to “ok”

Change my view. Thanks!

CMV: The power of magic has caused people born into the wizarding world in Harry Potter to lack critical thinking and problem solving skills.,2974,206,2019-08-31 01:45:12,"The ability to use magic in the Harry Potter universe has allowed for creative solutions to a lot of problems that people face. However, I believe that using magic to solve problems has caused people born into the wizarding world to be unable to think through basic problems well themselves. Instead, solving a problem is just knowing the name and wand movement of a spell that will take care of things. This reliance has bled into how people navigate all situations that don't have an obvious or magical solution.

I've been going back through the entire plot, mostly by listening to the podcast Mostly Nitpicking do a full movie series run, and have noticed how a lot of characters lack what people typically consider common sense in a lot of situations. The character who does seem to know everything in every situation is one who was born and raised entirely isolated from magic, Hermione. I think a lot of what makes her studious nature so unique is that she actually wants to understand things and how to deal with unexpected circumstances while people born into magic aren't worried about figuring things out for themselves.

A real life analogy to this could be comparing a student who came from a privileged background and had others, like their parents, do things for them versus a student who didn't have this luxury and needed to do more for themselves. A student who never needed to do things on their own typically struggles more with critical thinking than their peers because they're used to having other people do that for them. In Harry Potter, those born into magic face a similar problem as a result of magic replacing the need to do many things themselves.

This seems to be most apparent with the three main characters. Ron, the only character who has relied on magic to accomplish basic tasks for his entire life, is shown to be less independent in his thinking, to have less initiative, and to look like an absolute dunce when a solution isn't obvious. Meanwhile, Harry and Hermione take initiative for themselves much more frequently and are able to reach solutions themselves. This is a small sample size admittedly, and I'm using it more as an example than as proof. 

I can see how the ability to use magic to help with things can foster more creative thinking and promote problem solving skills, but I don't think that plays out in the people in the universe. Instead, magic is hamstringing most witches' and wizards' ability to think effectively for themselves.",1
CMV: To believe in a loving God requires a certain level of delusional thinking or ignorance to how the world works.,2969,1945,2018-02-06 20:42:02,"I have no intention to insult those who believe this, i've always just found it a terrible thing to believe. I'm genuinely interested in a rational explanation for the problems I have with this idea as i've never gotten one, most people just shut down or get angry when I ask it. With that out of the way let me tell you why...

If we are to think there is a God, and that it loves us, I assume we mean the definition of love we created. Not some backwards version we can say God has. So why would a loving God allow innocent people to suffer and die? Especially in Judeo-Christian values, this would be obscene for a God to do. 5 million children die a year. Even if we removed the number of children that died at the hands of another human, the number would still be massive. How does that sound like love? How does a child randomly getting cancer sound like love, in our context as humans?

I could go on, but I feel this is a good jumping off point. Thanks for posts in advance!

CMV: America is the corrupted enterprise Eisenhower warned about,2964,228,2019-01-04 23:27:37,"Other than the sections of the speech below, I think I can summarize my view shortly. I served for just about 5 years in the Navy as an officer. Over two deployments I shifted my view from one where the United States was ultimately a force for good to one where the United States is, at base, a hammer constantly looking for nails. I was repeatedly disabused of my ideals of American foreign policy by the lackluster ideas of the senior officials I spoke with and the incompetent logic of the few Admirals I had the luck to get into lecture rooms with. One exceptionally frightening experience was listening to a 90-minute lecture from an Admiral on his belief that within a decade we would be in a shooting war with China (this lecture was given in 2015).

In short, from these experiences and spending two extended maintenance periods in Navy shipyards, swimming with contractors, I believe that America's foreign policy is no longer a force for good. That an ""unwarranted influence"" exists between the military (and it's consequent industries) and our government. And that we do not have ""an alert and knowledgeable citizenry"" steering a ""proper meshing"" of the military, industry and our society's peaceful, pro-liberty goals.

Ultimately, my belief is that Americans no longer have the ability to extract ourselves from the state of constant war that we presently have. We will continue to expand our involvement internationally so that an era of peace will never again exist in the United States where all of our troops will be at home (excepting our international bases) and there won't be a looming clock of regularly planned interventionist deployments.

Slightly condensed, the speech reads as follows (full speech here: [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/eisenhower-farewell/](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/eisenhower-farewell/))

    Despite these holocausts America is today the strongest, the most influential and most productive nation in the world. Understandably proud of this pre-eminence, we yet realize that America's leadership and prestige depend, not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches and military strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.
    Progress toward these noble goals is persistently threatened by the conflict now engulfing the world. It commands our whole attention, absorbs our very beings. We face a hostile ideology global in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose, and insidious in method. Unhappily the danger it poses promises to be of indefinite duration...
    
    A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction.
    Our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime, or indeed by the fighting men of World War II or Korea.
    Until the latest of our world conflicts, the United States had no armaments industry. American makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well. But now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense; we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions. Added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment. We annually spend on military security more than the net income of all United States corporations.
    ... The total influence -- economic, political, even spiritual -- is felt in every city, every State house, every office of the Federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society.
    In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
    We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.
    ...Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity. For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers.
    The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present -- and is gravely to be regarded.
    Another factor in maintaining balance involves the element of time. As we peer into society's future, we -- you and I, and our government -- must avoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering for, for our own ease and convenience, the precious resources of tomorrow. We cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without asking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage. We want democracy to survive for all generations to come, not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow.

Edit/Update: Just wanted to put this link here because a few people got into it with me about whether or not the DoD budget was too large. They argued that military spending has been declining versus GDP for decades. I pointed out that the public does not know the actual spending on the military because SpecOps stuff is sometimes made secret and disappears from the budget. I linked a WaPo article from 2015 (it's down there in my responses) and today an article comes out about effectively legalizing hiding the military budget from the public.

CMV: Patients should always be offered the ability to record themselves during procedures that use amnesia type drugs.,2963,317,2019-09-08 00:28:18,"Had to take my last one down because of the wording.   

Before a patient is placed under a cocktail of drugs that effect their memory, there should be a *direct proactive* option for them to record it.     
      
It is understood these can be recorded upon request but this places physicians and staff at a level they feel personally attacked. It upsets some of them to a point they will not provide any additional services for comfort and recovery beyond what they are allowed to withhold.    
This is not an unusual request thrown into the mix that would be too tedious to add. This is an option that would benefit all patients in this scenario. They even proactively ask if sentimental jewelery is requested in the OR.        
          
And I also realize major operations are heavily monitored.  But even the minor operations should be recorded for the patient, for a fee. You are taking away someone's memories.         
        
If someone reacts poorly to something because their comorbidities were overlooked or just ignored as irrelevant, this could easily be erased from their memories and not a word spoken of it. Any lapses of memory they do have from it, pushed aside as hallucinations.                 

Some people do have conditions that make the setting of general anesthesia to be pretty traumatizing and many have no recollection. And no one speaks a word of it to maintain a cleaner record. And it just keeps happening.      
             
           
I believe most doctors are only doing what is best for the patient. But I also realize there are some that would rather drug the patient than admit fault. There are some that do not have the patients best interest at heart. This is important, this is your life vs someone's misplaced ego or direct carelessness for an alternative motive.          
         
 

Although I believe police are far more capable of direct malice than doctors, they do have body cams and a good handful have been known to physically do anything to stop the recording of themselves because it feels like a personal attack on them. It's human nature to feel threatened by the request of being recorded when it's not a typical scenario. Some doctors understand and don't mind this at all but unfortunately some are still very offended by this and if the patient was instead offered, this scenario of bias wouldn't exist.",1

I did give a Delta to a poster who convinced me that an overwhelming majority of professional journalists are Democrat, but my opinion is **not entirely changed** (the rules of this sub say to award Deltas even if your opinion is only slightly changed) - I'm still trying to encourage discourse but I don't want people to get the idea that I'm walking back every single point I've made so far. 

-----

In the world of cable news, it's no secret that Fox News is alone - however, viewership numbers show that Fox gets more eyeballs on the screen than CNN and MSNBC combined. From this alone, I believe it's dishonest to say that mainstream conservative media doesn't exist.

Conservative talk radio is another thing altogether - go down the list of most-listened-to talk radio, and you see that Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, etc. get several million listeners every week, and meanwhile the first liberal personality is at #16 - below about 8 programs that are explicitly conservative. Podcast numbers tell a less compelling story, but Ben Shapiro is still at #5 in a sea of apolitical or moderate shows.

Social media is another realm where I'd say conservative talking points are in the mainstream (although one of those talking point is how liberal social media sites are) though I don't have numbers to back them up. 

Anyway, my point is that the idea that ""mainstream media"" is exclusively liberal is a myth, and there is plenty, if not more, evidence that conservative media has just as much (if not more) sway on the population.",1

CMV: Prostitution should be legal in the states.,2943,972,2019-12-14 23:44:42,"*Resubmitted due to mod request.*

Hey everyone,

I'm someone who is a genuine advocate for legalizing safe prostitution practices. I will try my best to  the list reasons for why I feel this is the correct way to go about things. I truthfully, honest to god, don’t see why anyone would be against legalizing it.

&#x200B;

1. It’s illegal right now, and it still happens. Something must be done to make it a legitimate business.
2. Prostitution is no different then brainless labor work (coal mining)
3. Legalizing prostitution would mean these hotgirls and their ‘corners’ (would be a store prob) would have to meet regulation requirements ie: safer sex for everyone involed.
4. The government collects taxes on all of this, eliminates pimps, number of unwanted baby’s would plummet...

CMV: Transgenders will never be the biological sex they wish they were,2921,1111,2020-06-14 14:02:14,"Okay, my opinions are a tad complicated. Firstly, I believe gender is simply a list of stereotypical traits we've assigned to one sex or the other. Secondly, transgender people will never be the sex they choose to be from a strictly biological perspective. Obviously you can't change your chromosomes, but also obviously no one KNOWS which mix of chromosomes one has, and it doesn't particularly matter on a surface level. However, you can turn your dick inside out and snip your nuts off all you want, and inverted dick is still a dick. You still have XY chromosomes (presumably). That's not to say I don't have sympathy for those who are transgender, I do. It sounds like hell, and I'm sorry you don't have the body you feel like inside. And that's also not to say I don't support having SRS, HRT, etc. Your body, your life, do what makes you happy.

I think of it in terms of hyperbole, however, and here's where my failure to understand comes into play. Let's say I identify as Spider-man. Put aside the fact that he's a fictional character, and that identifying as Spider-man is inherently very silly, I identify as Spider-man. I wake up every day wishing I was Spider-man, that I had super agility, strength, and could stick to walls, all the traits a Spider-man has. Sure, I could build web-shooters, design a cool costume with mini ""hairs"" that help me stick to walls. Despite all of that, I will never, biologically speaking, be a Spider-man. I will never have a spider's DNA spliced with my own. What makes the ""Spider-man"" premise incredibly silly, and the other not so? Why is identifying as something seemingly more important than biological fact? (Aside from ""blah blah blah, 'female brain,' blah blah."") Why is one an unhealthy delusion, but the other seemingly not-so in recent years? This is more of a ""HelpMeUnderstand,"" but that sub only has 7 followers.

Edit: Appreciate the platinum!

CMV: when you move to a new country you should want to assimilate,2928,626,2020-01-18 03:59:46,"People often claim it’s racist to suggest that people who move to a country should integrate  with the culture they’ve moved to. I think that it’s perfectly reasonable to expect that they do. This isn’t to suggest that they cannot hold on to their previous identities, or speak their mother tongue language to people who also speak it, or practice their religious values, but they should want to adopt some of the culture exists in their new country. 

They chose to move to a new country, and it shouldn’t be surprising that people find some things like the fact that they won’t learn the language, or they talk down on the culture, a bit annoying. This in no way means that they should be harassed or mistreated for it though. 

I just don’t understand why it’s something people view as racis/xenophobic. 

Edit: when I say integrate, I don’t mean giving up things like their native food or likes and dislikes, but rather learning to speak the language of their area, or trying to respect the cultural values of their surrounding area. The goal should be that you want to combine your cultures.",1
CMV: The United States is a very racially tolerant country.,2923,938,2020-08-10 07:52:47,"This position will necessarily be stated in comparative terms; I can certainly imagine some post racial, colorblind society compared to which America would look positively dystopian, but compared to what's reasonable to expect a country to be in 2020 by comparing the US to other contemporary nations i think we're actually a very racially tolerant country. 

First it should be noted that [our citizens are about as racially tolerant as they come](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/05/15/a-fascinating-map-of-the-worlds-most-and-least-racially-tolerant-countries/%3FoutputType%3Damp&ved=2ahUKEwjcra7OhY_rAhVBKawKHd-cD1kQFjAAegQIBxAC&usg=AOvVaw3xNNSa1ib92qhg1Bw4VPG6&ampcf=1); some countries are our equal in this regard but none are really notably our betters. Most Americans [support diversity](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2019/04/22/how-people-around-the-world-view-diversity-in-their-countries), and again we're one of the global leaders in that regard. And our police forces, often derided as extremely racist, [might actually be less racist than our not very racist general public](https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=249126), or at least more able to repress whatever racial bias they do possess. 

Things like BLM can give the impression that race relations are very poor in this country, but I'd actually argue the opposite; the mere fact that the vast majority of Americans support BLM and that tens of millions of us are willing to take to the streets in its names is proof of how deeply Americans care about stamping out racism. The fact that up to 15% of Americans, some 50,000,000 people, are willing to go so far as *abolishing* the police entirely to help combat a tiny amount of police shootings that *might* have been racially motivated is frankly quite astonishing. Indeed, I'm unaware of any other country that has dedicated as much social, media, and academic time and interest to studying the issue of racism in our society and how to best combat it. One gets the impression that if black lives truly did not matter in the United States there would be no BLM, because nobody would give a shit about racial injustice - instead, most people here do, and I'm unaware of any analogous movements in any other country protesting the racial injustices that occur there. If we truly were a deeply racist, white supremacist nation then BLM would have never gotten off the ground. 

And there are racial injustices elsewhere. Racial disparities in things like wealth, incarceration, infant mortality, etc. are rampant across similar developed nations like the UK, Australia, and Canada, as well as many countries that scored as just as racially tolerant across South America. Obviously such disparities are even more egregious in less tolerant countries like India. Did any of those countries start a BLM type movement? Not that I'm aware of. Certainly none as large or notable or passionate. The kneejerk reaction to that fact is to assume that's because racism is a worse problem in the US, but perhaps its just because Americans are more aware of our racist problems and more dedicated to fighting against them. 

And obviously its asinine to think racism is over just because Obama got elected, but that fact shouldn't be trivialized, either; yes, America has only had one minority Commander in Chief, but that's one more than pretty much all our contemporaries can boast. Where's the ethnically Indian British PM? Where's the native American leader of Canada? 

Further, while I do fully understand that we often focus on much more significant racial issues in this country, the mere fact that we have the time and luxury to devote massive amounts of social attention to issues like the number of black Oscar winners not *precisely* matching up with the demographics of the country indicates just how good race relations are in this country. Its fairly hard for me to imagine a deeply racist, white supremacist nation giving a flying fuck about how many awards famous, rich black Hollywood elites are getting. 

Its often said that we need to have more conversations about race... but do we? Granted I've only been around for a few decades but for as long as I've been aware it seems like we're absolutely *obsessed* with the topic. We talk about it all the time. [Black history and various related racial injustices are major topics in US schools](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.socialstudies.org/system/files/publications/articles/se_810117014.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwispYb9-47rAhVIC6wKHTCQCoEQFjAAegQIBBAB&usg=AOvVaw2Vtyzv7PmWrR3NZ6jcFyoa). There have been countless articles and studies and books written about these topics. Documentaries and movies made. Special interest groups. Minority caucuses. Affirmative action. Grants and scholarships. Apologies have been issued and reparations paid. Tens of trillions of dollars and God knows how many man hours spent combating racial inequalities. 

Its not my view that just because I believe America is a very racially tolerant country that racism is therefore solved and there are no social frontiers worth fighting for. I also fully recognize that arguably the only reason that we're as racially tolerant as we are now is due to the heroic efforts of civil rights activists both past and present. But I do reject the fatalistic, defeatist, depressing, race baiting narratives of bestselling authors like Ta-Nehisi Coates who paint a grim picture of an indelibly, deeply, and inescapably racist American nation. 

Change my view.

CMV: religion isn't needed to have morals,2917,659,2019-09-23 07:35:17,"Change my view!

Hey, as you might've guessed I'm an atheist. Often times I see religious people say that without religion they wouldn't know how to act, wouldn't know what's right or wrong, and ultimately wouldn't have any morals. 

I've heard ""what's to stop you from killing people without religion?"", and I find it absolutely silly. I've lived my whole life without being religious at all, and I kill as many people as I want to kill, 0. 

I have empathy, I understand that everyone has emotions and the will to live and discover. I feel emotions that other people feel. Why on earth would I want to hurt others because I don't have religion? I know my definition of right and wrong  without ever needing religion, or any influence like that. I see that this world is here to not only survive, but to thrive. As humans we are always discovering and curious about new things and it's great! We don't need religion to act proper. 

I'm not sure how to explain what keeps me from killing others, besides saying that I don't have the want to or feeling to at all. I live a happy life, always trying to do my best and give to my community. And not once have I needed religion to guide me, I see a need and I try to fill the need. 

My last point; I see someone is hurt, and I try to help them. That emotion in their brain is real, they feel it, and I know how that emotions feels because i felt it. That emotion isn't religion, it's your brain. So I help them, because I know how it feels and I don't want them to feel that way either. 

Idk if I worded this right or not, I'm bad at wording things, but I don't think religion is needed to have morals. Change my view!",1
CMV: I support Donald Trump,2917,1485,2017-01-31 08:19:37,"In light of the recent massive online outcry against Trump, I want to once more reflect on the validity of my views. During the election cycle, I came to respect Trump even if I could see his flaws. The arguments I saw for him/his positions were generally logical and well reasoned, while the arguments against him were ad hominems, personal stories, and otherwise emotional in nature. Any time I questioned things, I was called a racist and a bigot. Even though for most of my life I considered my views liberal, the election cycled saw me switching to the Trump Train.

Specifically on the recent immigration issue, while I don't think it will particularly stop terrorism or that terrorism is a threat currently, I do think it shows Trump's commitment to preventing a situation like the one in Europe. The initial green card situation was unfortunate, but from what I have seen was quickly solved. In addition, I see no reason why non-citizens, regardless of what they've gone through, should feel entitled to enter the US. Yes, it would be nice to help people, but realistically the world is filled with people who are suffering, even in our own country, and we should be smart with who and how we help. 

I hold a similar view on something like the wall. I don't think it will even close to eliminate illegal immigration, and it won't even stop the main source of illegal immigration. However, it will stop some illegal immigration, and from what I've seen the cost is relatively minimal.

In terms of bringing jobs back, I think its a simple concept that if things can be done cheaper outside the US without any downside, they will be done elsewhere. I don't know how successful Trump will be, but I believe free trade deals will only hurt the average american worker. 

As for diplomacy, given the US's economic and military power, I don't see how Trump can hurt US relations. Dictators and horrible regimes across the globe are worked with because of the resources they have, and from a purely statistical standpoint I don't think the US can be ignored. I have no doubts some in the international community will hate Trump, but others will like him, and regardless the US has enough leverage that they will be worked with. I also don't believe Trump will start any major wars. He is highly successful and even his greatest detractors admit he cares about himself, so especially after he has stated he is anti-war, I do not see him getting into a situation where he puts himself at risk.

Finally, in terms of his provocative actions/statements, I generally don't have an issue with him. I am a quite un-PC person, and on top of that I have seen many of his actions/statements twisted brutally out of proportion. I think he has a blustery personality and has a habit of talking with his foot in his mouth, but I have yet to see something that makes me truly believe he is a cruel or vindictive person.  

If there are any specific questions or if somebody wants me to provide more information on a point, I will do so. I hope that a civic discussion can be maintained. ",1
CMV: All subreddits should specify the exact account age and post/comment karma required to post on them.,2909,60,2020-03-25 01:38:56,"When I first joined reddit I tried to post in several communities but my posts were either removed immediately since I had a new account, or would just disappear from ""new"" on the sub while still being visible on my profile. This can be very off-putting to new users who could be confused as to why their posts are being removed, and in addition users could put a lot of effort into creating original content that just gets removed immediately without a chance to be viewed.

If every sub specified the exact account age and karma required to post there, then people would be more motivated to post higher quality content elsewhere on subs to gain the karma that they need to post in a sub with stricter rules that they have created original content for. 

The subs that don't currently have a restriction on account age/karma would be unaffected, since this requirement would only apply to subs that have a restriction. In addition, although the upvotes on individual posts tend to fluctuate a lot, karma would still be measured in the same way that it is for moderator requirements so this wouldn't be an issue.",1
CMV: It's not anti-semitic to question the US's commitment to Israel.,2906,1085,2019-03-12 21:21:58,"*Preface: I'm neither Jewish, nor Muslim.  This CMV is about policy, not religion.*

This post is based loosely around the comments made by Ilhan Omar on foreign government lobbies.

>""I want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is OK for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country. I want to ask why is it OK for me to talk about the influence of the NRA (National Rifle Association), of fossil fuel industries or Big Pharma, and not talk about a powerful lobbying group that is influencing policies?""

She appears to be voicing her concerns on a powerful lobby (no doubt Israel), but the news articles seems to be pegging her words as ""tropes"".  Examples (including a very politically motivated FOX):

>Among the most basic anti-Semitic tropes are these: Jews employ semi-occult powers to control world events; they manipulate hapless gentiles with their money; and Jews in the diaspora are disloyal to the countries in which they live. Omar, in the course of making perfectly valid criticisms of Israel and its most powerful American lobby, has invoked each of these tropes.  - *NY Times*  
>  
>But given her previous comments, the latest remarks struck many observers as playing into well-worn anti-Semitic tropes about Jewish attachments to Israel making them disloyal to the United States.  -*VOX*  
>  
>By not forcefully condemning Omar’s anti-Semitism, by allowing her to stay on Foreign Affairs, by not condemning the BDS movement, the Democratic Party is helping mainstream anti-Semitism.  -*FOX*

&#x200B;

From my limited experience, there is some weird relationship the US has to Israel that I do not fully understand.  It's absurd, for example,  that presidential candidates are expected, near required, to go on national TV to announce their support of Israel before caucuses.  The amount of aid we send to Israel is also disproportionate in comparison to other countries.  Can you imagine if there was such fanfare over proclaiming support to Italy or even Russia?

It becomes especially concerning when hearing their Prime Minister refer to the US as almost a puppet:

&#x200B;

Maybe the military presence that Israel provides in the region is absolutely invaluable, but speaking out against them shouldn't be considered ""anti-semitic"".  They also appear to be the primary aggressor in building out their settlements.

Am I missing something here?  Why does Israel deserve this special treatment?

"CMV: People shaming others for ""only focusing on Hong Kong"" aren't being helpful whatsoever",2902,201,2019-10-12 22:02:01,"Reddit as of late seems like it's been focused on the events transpiring in Hong Kong more than I've ever seen it focused on a single issue before. 

I for one think this is amazing. *Insert ""I am so proud of this community"" meme here* I've seen posts criticizing Reddit itself for being part owned by a Chinese company that has been making efforts to censor the activism on this site on subreddits ranging in diversity from r/dankmemes to r/aww. 

Now I've begun to see a growing trend of people trying to shame others by bringing up other international tragedies and asking ""why we aren't doing anything about *insert oppressed population here*?"" (Uighurs, Tibetans, Kurds, Iranians,etc).

The points of my argument are as follows; it's not helpful whatsoever to bring up another tragedy without offering a solution. It's also not helpful to shame people for grassroots activism and using social media as a tool to inspire social change. And lastly, Reddit has no obligation to try and help everyone. If a political issue had gained a foothold in the mainstream, those who are passionate about helping other oppressed populations should be supporting Hong Kong alongside whatever other issue they care about. Not trying to take away from Hong Kong and trying to shift focus elsewhere.

To me it seems like it's a desperate attempt to seem woke by showing everyone ""Look! Look at me! I'm so cool and progressive that I know about other political tragedies too!""",1
CMV: Crazy Rich Asians is a mind-numbingly lazy film for the accolade it received,2900,210,2019-11-20 21:23:17,"There was so little chemistry between the main couple, Rachel and Nick. (How did she get a golden globe for that role?) The pacing of the film is all over the place, it feels incredibly soapy (which is okay for a mediocre rom-com), but then the responses were so good. It feels extremely circlejerk-y.

It did propel the career of many actors in Hollywood with Asian faces, and that is a good thing. But again, I saw very few great acting chops, or challenging roles (except for maybe Awkwafina and Sonoya Mizuno, Ken Jeong's acting was insufferable even though he's great in other things). I feel the accolade is not necessarily deserved.

The writing is horrendously slow, repetitive, shallow, on-the-nose and lacking momentum. The movie can't decide on what tone to strike from moment to moment. I've not read the book, so I wonder if the book is also this way, or was it just the screenwriters.

As an East Asian with friends that have affluent backgrounds, the film was causing all kinds of cognitive dissonance. For a film that talks about the cultural conflicts and importance of tradition in these communities, it failed tremendously in conveying that message consistently through actual behavior and world building. Aside from Eleanor Young, every other main character seemed like a bunch of white people partying non-stop like in Fast & Furious or the Great Gatsby but with Asian faces. People coming from countries with traditional values or even struggles with those traditional values don't act like that. It's overall just lazy and shallow pandering, like a glamorous versions of the fondness for Eastern mysticism, but with shitloads of money.

I think the film has inflated positive responses, CMV.",1
CMV: Being fat is unhealthy and should be treated the same as smoking.,2898,1156,2018-05-01 00:17:08,"Some facts: 
Overweight and obesity are the fifth leading risk for global deaths. At least 2.8 million adults die each year as a result of being overweight or obese. (http://easo.org/education-portal/obesity-facts-figures/)

Then why is society saying being fat is ok and that you should be proud of your body if your fat?...
Beauty arguments aside (cause my opinion is that fat people are disgusting, and that beauty is not a social structure, its a biological preference)
No being fat is NOT ok. You don't need to be proud of it. If you say that people should be proud if they are fat, we teach kids it's ok to become fat. 
Being fat is a choice. It is NOT the same as being in a wheelchair.
Nobody is forcing you to sit on your ass and eat junk food. 
Some people say ""I eat healthy and i work out, and still i gain weight""
That is just impossible. If you eat perfectly healthy , and work out , You will burn more calories then you burn , hence you will loose weight. 


Edit: To clarify. I'm not talking about shaming them or being rude to them. Like we dont be rude to smokers. But we are allowed to say that smoking is bad. Its common knowledge. We wont ever say that that its ok to be proud that you are smoking. 
I'm not saying that we should shame them or make fun of them. We should just not be ok with the ""fat-acceptance movement"" like we should not be ok with the ""nicotine acceptance movement""
Commercials for cigarettes are not allowed anymore , but promoting being obese gets posted on the bbc channel ? :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCWirtR20jk

Make me see why that is correct? Why should the bbc tell the youth its ok to be fat but are not allowed to air cigarette commercials? 


Edit2:
Im not advocatin fatshaming . If they dont harm anyone else besides themselves, thats their own choise. But when they try to convince my kids that being fat is healthy, yeah im allowed to shit on them.
Just like i'm allowed to shit on people with aids that try to tell my son that unprotected sex is totally ok. 

Edit3: 
Holy shit. Woke up with 100+ Replies. 
Let me clarify a few things:
1. A lot of people are arguing against the fact that allegedly defend fat shaming. You are creating a strawman argument and then fighting that argument. I never said fat shaming is good. (although i have opinions about that which i noted down below, i never mentioned fat shaming in OP. So that is not what i want my view changed off. So  please. Stay on topic .  If you think that saying that being fat is unhealthy and that they should do something about it, is fat shaming, then yeah you won't change my view.
2. What i want to present and try to have changed me view on , is the fact we should treat obesity the same level as we tread smoking. The common argument used here is  : ""U dont need to smoke to survive. You need to eat to survive"". My answer: ""Eating doesn't make you fat. OVEREATING makes you fat. Eating is needed to survive. Overeating isn't.""

For all the people that saying they do live healthy and exercise but still gain weight. Well then you either have a misconception of either ""healthy"" or ""exercising"" Its science. U can't deny science. Yes of course some people have a higher metabolism then others. So some people have to work harder or eat less then other to stay healthy, but that's life. Still basic science applies.

For all the people saying : Smoking harms others, obesity doesn't. Well.  That's where you are right. And that's where i realized i've chosen a slightly flawed metaphor.  Of Course there are technical differences.
But the basic principles of the metaphor still stand. We should not allow promotion of obesity just like we don't allow promotion of smoking. 


Fact is that fat acceptance is on the rise. I see it more and more each day , on the news , tv , online.  The fact is also that the world is getting fatter. Every statistic confirms that. 
CMV: Just like smoking we should create campaigns to combat obesity. And don't be afraid to be called fat shaming if we just state facts that being obese is unhealthy. Or should we just leave them be and let the fat acceptance grow and let people become fatter because of it?

CMV: There is nothing morally wrong with paying for sexual activity,2895,632,2019-11-05 04:30:49,"Today I read an article that called paying for sex evil and exploitative. I admit that I took it personally as I pay for sex. 

For context, I have very precise sexual needs. I am male with a foot fetish for other guys feet. I am not interested in conventional sex with either men or women and do not want a relationship. Instead, I am paying guys hundreds to take pictures of, rub and suck on their feet. They are adults, not trafficked and not forced. I maintain that there is nothing morally wrong with this. 

You could argue that an unequal, capitalist society puts people in a situation where they decide to do something that they would rather not do to gain some benefit. They have something that I want and they are willing to trade that for cash. How is it any more evil or exploitative than any other capitalist transaction? 

Some of the guys use the money to be able to better provide for their kids. If it is OK to allow a strong man to use his back to provide for his family then why is it less reasonable to ask him to put his feet up and get paid for something arguably less damaging to his body?

I think the same principle applies regardless of the sexual activity and gender of the individuals involved.",1
"CMV: Successful people from humble backgrounds have had to work harder, and so deserve more respect than those with well-off families.",2897,274,2019-01-26 21:02:40,"In my view, people who were born into well-off families, and who subsequently become successful, for whatever reason, don't deserve the same amount of respect as successful people who come from more humble backgrounds. It's always struck me that most of the time, that former type of person has never really known, and likely will never know, hardship - and even more likely, won't have had to work as hard to get where they are as those whose families have less.

Let's illustrate this idea with the current US President, and his 'small loan of a million dollars' from his dad (which, with inflation, would be more like $70 million nowadays). He wouldn't have got where he is today without his family's fortune. He's had a silver spoon in his mouth all his life - how can he truly understand what Americans who are struggling are going through?

Speaking more generally, let's compare their childhoods. The majority of well-off families are going to want to send their kids to the best schools they can, and good for them: after all, most parents just want the best for their kids. Said well-off families are also going to be able to pay for extra tuition if their kid is struggling, music lessons, and so and so forth. Meanwhile, the less well-off families, who in many cases will also want the best for their offspring, would no doubt want to try and get their kids into good schools - but for various reasons (catchment areas, financial barriers, rigorous entrance tests) that just isn't possible. Same goes for the extracurricular stuff - unless it is subsidised, for many working-class families, that sort of thing just isn't feasible.

It's the same story at university level (a.k.a college, if you're American): kids with rich parents are able to take full advantage of uni life; for example, they won't need to take a part-time job to fund studies/living costs (on a side note, in the UK, our student loan is basically a graduate tax which is written off after 30 years, so it's not quite as bad as in the States). They'll probably be able to pay for textbooks/study materials, foreign trips and all the rest of it. Conversely, the poor kid is going to struggle to pay for a lot of this without a job and/or significant financial assistance (in the UK, at least if you're dirt poor, I understand the latter is actually quite decent for students).

Then what about those who move to big cities (London, NYC, LA, etc) to try and 'make it' in whatever industry (i.e. the media/showbiz, finance, creative industries, to name but a few)? The rich kid is inherently going to be at an advantage, because their families can financially support them; meanwhile, the poor kid is at best going to have to take a job in order to cover (if they're lucky) the high living costs in such cities. The rich kid can take unpaid internships, some of which are necessary for certain industries (the media is fairly notorious for them in the UK); for the poor kid, these are basically off-limits. Just how is that fair?

This is why I have so much respect for those who have made it from nothing - as trite as this may sound, they've had to go the extra mile in order to get where they are; meanwhile, someone at a similar level who had many hands up in their life hasn't had to work nearly as hard (even if, in their minds, they've worked exceptionally hard). What have they done? They've had help from Mummy and Daddy all their lives. It seems like nothing they've done has been entirely off their own backs. They were born rich and will probably die rich, never truly understanding the struggles of those worse off than them.

I realise much of this post will likely come across as inverse snobbery, and to be fair, it probably is. It is also, however, a view I have held for some time, albeit one which I realise could do with being challenged.

TL;DR: Successful people from more humble backgrounds deserve much more same respect than successful people from well-off background, because the former will have worked much, much harder to get where they are; meanwhile, the latter will usually have had a lot of help from their families.",1

CMV: smoking any place where others inhale your smoke should be illegal (public places),2873,741,2018-12-09 00:48:17,"First off let me start off by saying I don't smoke and never have. 

My argument really comes from the fact that I am often outside commuting some place walking  and I walk by someone smoking that smoke gets blown in my vicinity and it ends up entering my lungs and causing me to cough. As a person with slight asthma any bit of smoke I smell often causes me to cough and struggle a bit to breaths as long as I am bteathing it. Also, it is harmful to inhale someone else's smoke and it shouldn't be legal to subject others to that harm. In a sense I shouldn't have to inhale yoir second hand smoke because you want to smoke. Especially when trying to blow the smoke in other directions it can hit the people behind you. 

A valid counter argument shouldn't consist of an idea of move elsewhere or walk across the street etc. because then we are inconveniencing the people who are just walking to work or having a picnic in the park rather than the person who  is making them move. If I want to generalize this I state, suppose a family wants to have a picnic in a park, but can't because they would have to inhale smoke at every square inch due to many smokers. Is it more fair to the family or the smoker?

TL;DR: smoking in public places(sidewalks included) should be banned because inhaling smoke is harmful for the people nearby. 

Edit: I want to clarify a point against the same argument I hear over and over in this thread. Public transit, cars, and other pollutants are different in the sense that they have a benefit to someone and they shouldn't be banned. There are also regulations preventing cars and such from polluting too much. However, smoking has a benefit to nobody, not even the person smoking it.

"CMV: Documentaries like Leaving Neverland are setting an extremely dangerous precedent in which we can accuse who we want, about what we want, and then sit back and watch the subject burn.",2877,546,2019-03-08 22:38:46,"Recently there has been a massive amount of buzz about ""Leaving Neverland"", a documentary in which two young men reveal they were sexually abused by Michael Jackson. It's important to note that these are simply *allegations*, nothing has been proven as fact and nothing has been confirmed in a court of law. While there is evidence of some weird behavior (faxes, photos, etc) all accusations of sexual assault are literally without any sort of evidence or facts to back them up.

In the days since the documentary aired, Michael Jackson's brand has suffered incredibly damaging consequences, including:

- radio stations and music channels worldwide banning his music.
- Simpsons episode featuring Jackson pulled out of rotation.
- Jackson being publicly shunned and rejected by former friends.

I'm neither for or against Michael Jackson, but I'm worried about the the power of one-sided *""allegations""*. As Winston Churchill once said, ""A lie can get halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get it's pants on"" (perhaps a poor choice of quote given the context...)

Are we saying that anyone is able to create a documentary, single out [insert name here], literally accuse them of anything we want, and then sit back and watch the subject suffer the consequences?

That seems like a very dangerous precedent that we're setting here.

While I certainly do not advocate silencing victims or blocking a platform for people to speak out against mistreatment and victimization, I don't think being able to say and do whatever you want on a public forum as huge as HBO (USA) or Channel 4 (UK) before the subject can respond is fair at all. What if YOU personally were on the receiving end of that? Anyone who has ever been falsely accused of something, and found themselves playing catchup in an attempt to establish their innocence will know that it is a terrible feeling.

To me, it's akin to punching and kicking a guy taking a nap and calling it a ""fight"". These documentaries are extremely harmful, dangerous and have the potential to destroy innocent people.

CMV: Government officials and lawmakers should not be allowed to own or trade stocks.,2879,203,2020-05-14 19:24:38,"Although my view is from the perspective of a U.S. citizen this could probably apply to any country for the same reasons, and maybe already exists in other countries. Government officials are too close to policy creation, law creation, and privileged information. Information that could easily be used to make extremely advantageous trades before anyone else. If there was a 0% chance they could own or trade stocks wouldn't that weed out people who aim for positions of power solely for money, rather than those who aim for power to help shape, change and run their communities? I'm sure there are solutions that ""meet in the middle"" for this problem. I would like to hear your thoughts on how this can be done.",1
"CMV: Andrew Yang's plan to give all Americans $1,000 per month would do little more than dramatically increase rent prices and other prices as well.",2878,755,2019-03-21 21:09:29,"It seems like a universal and equal influx of cash like that without a change in supply will only lead to higher prices. Especially in areas like housing, etc. Most people it seems, who are renters, given an extra $1k/mo would want to move to a nicer apartment. Given a much higher demand for nicer apartments, landlords will be able to increase prices and maintain full occupancy. Similarly, cheaper housing could see an increase in price, because people would have the ability to pay and no other option. This extra money flooding the market does not come from an increase in supply or labor, so I don't see anything to keep market forces from doing their thing. I don't really see the upside.

I understand the arguments for UBI IFF automation and AI take away enough jobs to tank the economy. But right now, unemployment is extremely low, and implementing his plan would just effectively lead to inflation.

You can change my view by demonstrating that areas that have seen extensive UNIVERSAL basic income have not seen price increases. Also, I could be convinced by a logical, coherent argument showing that there's a flaw in my reasoning.",1
CMV: New York City is a terrible place to live.,2874,477,2019-09-30 16:08:14,"
To quote my favorite depressed horse ""New York is a great city to live in for 6 months and not a minute longer and only if you're insanely wealthy""

I just can't hide my disappointment anymore. I grew up with movies and books that glamorize the city and people who live there talking on and on about it and showing it as the center of the universe... but after having live there for almost a year I just want to say are you kidding me?!?

 Sure it is a fine city,Central Park is pretty impressive and the city looks wonderful in Christmas time (fyi so does every other city in the world). And the ever famous Times Square is like the visual equivalent of people shouting at you; GIVE ME YOUR MONEY! Buy this and this and that too and you will be happy!Just consume!"" So nauseating!

You always have to wait long lines in front of every good club and night life is very restricted to whatever is “popular” at the time and seems like all the clubs are copying each other (as a counter example there is a nude night club in Amsterdam and don’t let me get started on the nightlife in Berlin) and charging waaay to much and people are taking more photos than they are dancing.

 At the end of the day city is just chaotic and crowded and frustrating and smells weird (urine?) and full of over overpriced cafes and shops that keeps opening and closing and creates unnecessary hype and people wait in looong lines for the weirdest stuff (rainbow bagel...really?) while on the other side of the city people eat whole meals at the price of 1 rainbow bagel,the difference between economic groups is terrifying and tragic. 

 Public transportation is a lifesaver when the traffic literally stops (unless you have a helicopter to fly over and appreciate the skyscrapers-you know like in the movies) but you always know your train will be late and subway system's poor infrastructure always makes you feel on edge aand you guessed it,it smells funny too! And weirdest things happen and people just shrug and SMILE and say “Welcome to New York” like a homeless guy masturbating in the subway is “so NYC” and it is somewhat okay??! What?? It is so disturbing and wrong and it was like the least weird thing that happened to me on subway...

Homeless people are everywhere (to be clear they are not the problem but victims of a much bigger problem) and people walk pass them like its nothing like they are fixed figures on the streets which breaks my heart. 

And on top of that people are mostly stressed and over worked and always running somewhere... and yes every business center in every city looks hectic during rush hour but have those people ever been to Vienna? Barcelona? Amsterdam? Montreal? Melbourne?

People are more peaceful in there,take long lunches and they don’t live to work and in general more friendly and happy-looking.

I am so tired of hearing people say “New York City is the best in the world” Ummm no.

All of those cities I mentioned are much nicer  and healthier to live in than NYC and I never heard them brag about “being the best in the world” or mentioning in every movie they made how NYC is the center of the universe.

But all I see is huuuuge buildings so close to each other and it is suffocating the air and not such a pretty view.

"CMV: Due to the for-profit nature of healthcare in the US, people should be skeptical about the tests/care they're recommended in the hospital.",2866,246,2019-09-15 22:53:48,"Note: This isn't an anti-vax post. I fully support vaccines and have vaccinated both of my children.

Because of the for-profit nature of healthcare in the US, hospitals have a financial incentive to give their patients as many tests as possible and to give patients the most expensive treatment options that they can. One of the most common phrases I've heard by doctors when recommending these services is ""better safe than sorry!"" And, while true, it's important to assess risk relative to benefit which is not something doctors or hospitals are incentivized to do. Sure, better safe than sorry - but does someone really need an X-ray or MRI for an ankle injury when it's probably just a sprain?

Therefore the onus to be informed and call ""bullshit"" on unnecessary tests falls to the patient. The natural consequence of this is that patients need to be skeptical of all tests and treatment options recommended to them. This of course puts the patient at greater risk since the typical patient doesn't have a medical degree and can't adequately assess risk on their own. But given the known consequence of medical debt VS the unknown consequence of skipping a test, the most prudent choice (depending on individual circumstance) would likely be to skip the test.",1

"CMV: Reddit is the worst site for politics, political congregations, and political discussion.",2862,498,2019-10-23 23:06:57,"[CGP Grey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc&t=294s) made a hauntingly prophetic video in regard to how emotions, particularly, anger, manifests within large groups of like-minded individuals. Although it isn't explicitly stated in the video, I believe that a way to diffuse much of the problem is by having both sides talk to one another.

[Germany Talks](https://www.zeit.de/wissen/2019-08/armin-falk-germany-talks-behaviour-research-english)'s story is far too long for me to go through, but the essential gist of it is that once someone fills out a survey of their political views, they get matched up with those who, if they check the box to be able to talk to people that disagree with their views, have different political views. The project was an unexpectedly wholesome success and there are already expansions towards this concept.

Reddit is the polar opposite of Germany Talks. Like many other platforms, Reddit allows for the specified indulgence in particular communities that interest them. While the first thoughts that come to mind would be relatively non-toxic hobbies such as the News, Gaming, Jokes, and many others, the isolation between said communities creates a literal cultural divide between subreddits with the only means of interaction between the two is through cross-posting or organized brigades.

While this isn't necessarily a bad thing as r/gundam isn't remotely related to r/accidentalitalian, issues arise when communities that revolve around politics surface. If you watch CGP Grey's video, the anger germ doesn't get cultivated between two groups interacting with one another, they get cultivated and get increasingly toxic in settings between groups of like-minded individuals (sound familiar?), where they get angrier by stating their detest for the other side (it sounds familiar to me). These politics also spread and take over other subs with wildly different purposes. While r/unpopularopinions used to be about, well, unpopular opinions, now they're a circle jerk hub of conservative viewpoints that aren't necessarily seen culturally as ""popular"" in mainstream media. r/murderedbywords is now a dilapidated retardation of r/trumproasts. And r/conservative and r/ChapoTrapHouse are toxic to anyone who doesn't exactly align with their beliefs.

r/changemyview is the subreddit ontop a shining hill confoundingly by actively encouraging participation on both sides. However, I believe that since the CGP Grey-effect is in full swing, people who lean on either extreme are disconcertingly becoming more and more unwilling to talk to each other, because ""obviously the other side is a brainwashed moron who needs Fox News or CNN to spoon-feed them fake news since they can't think for themselves. I watched Mr. Robot and it really says a lot about our society."" This leads to the trend of more and more centrist voices only participating in this sub, which although I don't discredit centrist opinions, is hardly a viable method for us to be able to congregate and discuss matters on political issues that concern us.

As a self-pronounced conservative myself, I get offended when someone attacks me of my viewpoint by generalizing me to fit a stereotype when they claim that they want to strip everyone from their stereotypes. I get offended when conservatives become disillusioned with ""society"" with their few encounters with those with political opinions that are different to them under the guise of ""we just want to talk!"". I get overjoyed when there are people like Boyan Slat who, at such a young age, created such a needed technology for our society and am unapologetically appreciative to people such as flat earth community, who dare to challenge against the industry-funded research and are willing to even do their research themselves. But if you bring up the good qualities of flat earth or even the anti-vax community, whom I'd applaud for similar reasons, (and also abhorrently hate for other reasons) in a discussion? You immediately get downvoted and essentially, for all intents and purposes, suppressed because you *dared* to speak against the hivemind.

We need more systems in place on our website, which does have its good qualities, to be able to encourage and cultivate programs similar to Germany Talks. I don't have a system in mind. posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/dlfx9n/can_members_of_the_trump_cult_be_deprogrammed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) or (truth be told I looked around in my own traditionally conservative subreddits for an example to balance things out but it's 12 AM on a school night so I'll let your mind fill in the blanks) is not only unhelpful, hypocritical, but kind of pathetic. Now [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouFellForItFool/comments/cjlngm/you_fell_for_it_fool/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)? this is good shit.

EDIT: I would like to clarify a couple of things after receiving some helpful comments.

While I'm unsure if my identity would be relevant at all to the discussion, I feel best that it'd be helpful to point out that I am a 17-year-old Asian-American living in Asia. I lived in America for brief periods of my life and studied abroad in Canada for several years. I hope this clears up any sort of potential mischaracterization of my identity.

Perhaps my title was overtly hyperbolic. [Agar.io](https://Agar.io) is probably not the best place to go to if you want a nuanced discussion on the political-economic situation in Greece. I propose the title to mean that Reddit is the worst as it *presents* itself as the communal culture hub of the internet while segregating everyone by their party lines in terms of politics- by design. Of course, it's not intentional or meant to be malicious. The site belongs in r/crappy design.",1
"CMV: Arguing that historically oppressed people such as blacks cannot be racist only fuels further animosity towards the social justice movement, regardless of intentions.",2858,605,2018-04-02 01:22:22,"Hi there! I've been a lurker for a bit and this is a my first post here, so happy to receive feedback as well on how able I am on expressing my views. 

Anyway, many if not most people in the social justice movement have the viewpoint that the historically oppressed such as blacks cannot be racist. This stems from *their* definition of racism where they believe it requires systemic power of others to be racist. This in itself is not a problem, as they argue that these oppressed people can be prejudiced based on skin color as well. They just don't use the word 'racist'. 

The problem, however, lies in the fact that literally everyone else outside this group has learned/defined racism as something along the lines of ""prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior."" Google (whatever their source is), merriam webster, and oxford all have similar definitions which don't include the power aspect that these people define as racism. 

Thus, there is a fundamental difference between how a normal person defines racism and how a social justice warrior defines racism, even though in most cases, they mean and are arguing the same exact point. 

When these people claim in shorthand things like ""Black people can't be racist!"" there is fundamental misunderstanding between what the writer is saying and what the reader is interpreting. This misinterpretation is usually only solvable through extended discussion but at that point the damage is already done. Everyone thinks these people are lunatics who want to permanently play the victim card and absolve themselves from any current or future wrongdoing. This viewpoint is exacerbated with the holier-than-thou patronizing attitude/tone that many of these people take or convey. 

Twitter examples:

https://twitter.com/girlswithtoys/status/862149922073739265
https://twitter.com/bisialimi/status/844681667184902144
https://twitter.com/nigel_hayes/status/778803492043448321

(I took these examples from a similar CMV post that argues that blacks can be racist https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/6ry6yy/cmv_the_idea_that_people_of_colour_cannot_be/)  

This type of preaching of ""Blacks can't be racist!"" completely alienates people who may have been on the fence regarding the movement, gives further credibility/ammunition to the opposition, and gives power to people that actually do take advantage of victimizing themselves, while the actual victims are discredited all because of some stupid semantic difference on how people define racism. 

Ultimately, the movement should drop this line of thinking because the consequences far outweigh whatever benefits it brings.

~~In fact, what actual benefit is there to go against the popular definition and defining racism as prejudice + power? I genuinely cannot think of one. It just seems like an arbitrary change.~~ Edit: I now understand that the use of the definition academically and regarding policies is helpful since they pertain to systems as a whole.

CMV: Overbooking should be illegal.,2849,775,2017-04-11 00:22:27,"So this is sparked by the United thing, but is unrelated to issues around forcible removal or anything like that.  Simply put, I think it should be illegal for an airline (or bus or any other service) to sell more seats than they have for a given trip.  It is a fraudulent representation to customers that the airline is going to transport them on a given flight, when the airline knows it cannot keep that promise to all of the people that it has made the promise to.

I do not think a ban on overbooking would do much more than codify the general common law elements of fraud to airlines.  [Those elements are:](https://www.mitchell-attorneys.com/common-law-fraud)

>(1) a representation of fact; (2) its falsity; (3) its materiality; (4) the representer’s knowledge of its falsity or ignorance of its truth; (5) the representer’s intent that it should be acted upon by the person in the manner reasonably contemplated; (6) the injured party’s ignorance of its falsity; (7) the injured party’s reliance on its truth; (8) the injured party’s right to rely thereon; and (9) the injured party’s consequent and proximate injury.

I think all 9 are met in the case of overbooking and that it is fully proper to ban overbooking under longstanding legal principles.

Edit: largest view change is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/64kkxe/cmv_overbooking_should_be_illegal/dg339e5/) relating to a proposal that airlines be allowed to overbook, but not to involuntarily bump, and that they must keep raising the offer of money until they get enough volunteers, no matter how high the offer has to go.

CMV: High Schools (or at least the 11th and 12th grade) should allow for students to have more choices in the classes that they want to take and have less required classes.,2853,191,2020-05-16 03:35:40,"
I’m currently a high school senior (well I finished my work a few days ago so technically I’m basically out of school), and I found this subreddit and I really wanted to see if people could change my view on this.


Ever since I was in elementary school, I’ve never liked school. I didn’t want to go to school because honestly, I found it quite boring. The highlights of my school day were talking to my friends and going to art class because hey, that’s what I was interested in. I will also just say that I do believe that a big part of me not wanting to go to school was simple kid stuff. I’m pretty sure that lots of elementary school aged kids would have rather stayed home and watched tv, colored, played sports, or whatever interested them at that age. I’m only mentioning this because it kind of has to do with my argument.


Back when we physically went to school, I remember I was sitting in my calculus class while my teacher was lecturing, and I asked myself, “why am I learning this?”. As interesting as finding the slope of a line at a certain point on it, and then using that information to find the acceleration of it at that point too, I can’t understand how somebody in a non STEM field would need to know how to do this.I will admit that this came from a place of laziness and boredom (because I will be a computer science major in college and I may or may not be using calculus techniques and ideas), but I thought about my friends that were going to major in English, art, or or even go to college. Why were they being forced to stay in higher level math classes to get the credits to graduate when they could use that same slot of their time to focus on something they’re actually interested in?


I know I’m about to go down the whole middle school meme route with this one (like when the class clown asks a teacher when they’re ever going to use a certain concept in their algebra class in real life), but I feel like they have a point (they just don’t phrase it the right way). I ask myself, when AM I going to use these concepts in real life? I had to stop getting math homework help from my parents around my transition from elementary school to middle school because they simply just didn’t remember how to do it. It wasn’t applicable to their daily lives. It isn’t just adults that forget how to do concepts in school that they were taught, it’s teens too. I’m a year ahead in math, but I can’t count how many times a friend has asked me how to do a concept they were taught in a class that I took last year, and I’d respond with “you know, I can’t remember”. I think that this has to do with either me not being interested enough to know how to solve problems a year after I was taught, or I never had to use it again so I cleared my “brain space” for something else.


If I went off on a slight tangent there, I apologize. But I ask again, why are high schoolers forced to take these higher level classes that they have no interest in? The most common argument I see is that “oh, well they’re young and still in high school, they don’t know exactly what they want in the future so we shouldn’t have personalized classes”. I’d argue against that and say that by the time a student is in the 10th or 11th grade, they have a pretty good idea of what they want to do in the future. To add onto this, many college students do end up changing their major, so I don’t see why that argument only applies to high schoolers. I feel like if we were not required to take as many “required core” classes, we could instead take classes that seem interesting to us and help us explore different activities.


Some of the classes that I think should be “optional” are super upper level math courses that will only benefit students if they’re going into a STEM field, and history classes that focus on memorizing little details instead of focusing on the impact on the world. (For example, I believe that history classes that make you memorize when the Byzantine Empire was founded, when it ended, and what they did is highly irrelevant information for anybody not going to college for anything historical). 



So if anybody could CMV on this, it would be greatly appreciated. I’m always looking for opportunities to become more educated on certain topics, and this is one I’m really interested in.


Edit: First I just want to thank everyone who has given up some of their time to write such a detailed and well written response. I promise that I’m reading them all, even if I don’t respond to you (there’s so much to read and I didn’t expect this to get so popular). But yeah, thank you all again! I was thinking of giving out more deltas because some of you guys have such amazing responses, but I’m not sure if giving out too many is suspicious (it’s my second day on the sub and I haven’t really paid attention to how many deltas are given out per post). 

Also, thank you to everyone that warned me about the amount of math in CS. All I’m going to say is, I’m glad that I’m good at math! :) 

But yes, I’ll continue reading all of the responses, maybe respond to a few, and I might continue tomorrow (it’s getting a little late for me), thank you all again!",1
CMV: Daryl Morey of the Rockets should absolutely not be fired for his tweet supporting Hong Kong,2855,195,2019-10-08 09:08:55,"Daryl Morey is the general manager of the Rockets. On Sunday he tweeted a picture with the caption ""Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong"".  


In the following hours the Rockets were blacklisted by chinese networks, broadcasting partners and even their minor league sister team in china. Daryl Morey deleted his tweet and posted a [statement](https://twitter.com/dmorey/status/1181000808399114240) explaining that it was not intended to offend Chinese fans (this has been called a retraction or apology but a careful reading reveals that it is no such thing - more like an apologetically-framed press release), and the NBA posted an English statement explaining that they don't want to offend the Chinese and a Chinese translation of that statement that was a groveling apology that threw Daryl Morey ([under the bus](https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/nba-statement-english-chinese-66104687)).  


So let me argue that Daryl Morey should absolutely not be fired for this for the following reasons:  


1.  Daryl Morey is right. Freedom is good, Hong Kong is fighting for freedom against a Chinese government that wants to end the last exceptions it has to the dictatorial constraints the rest of the nation faces. Were China merely leaving Hong Kong alone with the levels of freedom it had just a few years ago these protests wouldn't have escalated in the way they have.
2. From the purely cynical point of view he did endanger a business he's supposed to work for and profit but only as a mistake and quickly sought to correct it. There's no reason to believe that Morey intended to cause the furor he did, just earnestly express a reasonable opinion as many NBA staff members do every day. When the consequences became clear he deleted the tweet and wrote his conciliatory statement rather than doubling down, likely at the behest of some PR person but anyways minimizing the impact on the business he works for to the best of his ability.
3. He's great at his job. The Rockets have enjoyed tremendous success during his tenure as GM. There is no case here that he's actually barely hanging on to his job and this could be a good excuse to boot him.",1
CMV: Jail and prison sentences should be reserved only for people that are a legitimate danger to society.,2850,401,2019-11-14 13:22:44,"I just read a news article about how they just handed down the longest prison sentence for the college admissions scandal, which was six months.

The public isn't endangered. What's the point of even sending someone like Felicity Huffman to jail for two weeks? The public is as safe from her now as it was before.

I just don't see the point of sending these types of people to prison. Locking them up helps no one in the long run.

Prison sentences should be reserved for those that commit violent and serious crimes. Murderers, sex offenders, major white collar criminals (of which I do not count the above).

"CMV: I don't like sand. It's coarse, and rough, and irritating, and it gets everywhere.",2849,58,2017-04-01 23:32:08,"So, let me give some background. From a young age, I was a slave on the desert planet, known as Tatooine. And let me tell you, there was sand *everywhere*. It got in my eyes at times, during sandstorms, I was cut and bruised just by all of that coarse, gritty sand. Really, it was all there was in sight, and I really just could not get away from the stuff fast enough. I've been avoiding places with a lot of sand, since then, and it's really strained some family relationships. I'm considering going back to see my mother, if she's even still alive, just to rescue her from those cruel people down there.

Now, my girlfriend, on the other hand (I'm not sure if we're really  ""official"" yet, but we're basically a thing), she actually seems to have sort of an affinity for the stuff. She told me that she loved swimming to this one island with all of her school friends when she was younger, and then just lying there, on that disgusting, coarse, gritty sand until the sun dried them out. I really don't know what she sees in sand, honestly. I mean, how can you like something so, so coarse? So rough? So irritating? Not to mention, it gets *everywhere*, as I've mentioned before.

I really don't want this to become a strain on our relationship. At the same time, I just can't stand sand. It's so awful, not to mention all the savages that live *in* the sand, particularly on Tatooine. Maybe I'm wrong about sand, maybe I'm being unfair to it.

If a person has been banned from a subreddit, the moderators of that subreddit should have to have at least 1 post in that subreddit to ban you for. I would even go so far as to say there must be atleast 1 post in the subreddit that they can point to as you causing problems or breaking their rules. 

I am mostly thinking of subreddits which seem to have automated banning which targets subs they disagree with either politically or socially.

I hold this view because it excludes people from conversation and does not permit a legitimate member of a community to participate in that community simply based on their membership in another community.

I will now use a scenario not purposefully calling out any particular subreddits (as I believe that is against the rules). Say a Sub called WhitePeopleAreTheBest (WPB from here out) exists and it is dedicated to showing off accomplishments that whites have made throughout history and in modern society. Say there is a sub called LGBTloveIsGreat and it is all focused on supporting LGBT+ couples and helping people express their love. A moderator (or perhaps the creator of that sub) determines that those who support ""WPB"" are all hateful people and they don't want them participating in their sub. It is entirely likely that members of WPB want to support the mission of the other sub but because of that one mods decision to employ some automatic ban system (or doing so manually) they are not able to add to the community.

To be clear I would be most interested in discussion the ideas of directly opposing subreddits such as a Pro-Gun subreddit against a Anti-Gun subreddit, or a sub dedicated to benefiting the pro-choice movement vs a sub dedicated to a pro-life movement. I feel like this is the area where I am most unsure on my stance in and I want to know if my view may be wrong in this area specifically. (Though I am open to other discussions)

Edit: The case regarding directly opposed subreddits I can get behind them autobanning based on participating assuming moderators actually take appeals seriously in case of a change of mind. In addition a very niche example has been pointed out to me which I can get behind where it involves a directly related subreddit banning you based on certain actions which are against their rules.",1
CMV: The average homeowner does not benefit from constantly rising house prices,2842,279,2020-06-26 18:55:41,"I often hear that consistently inflation beating rises in house prices are A Good Thing. People who own houses seem very happy that their house has increased in monetary value, despite the fact that the utility they get from it has not increased at all. Given that they are most likely to sell their house in order to buy another, often more valuable, one they would be better off if house prices went down as this would reduce the difference in price between the two properties.

From an overall economic point of view the total value of housing stock is often quoted, showing how the total value has risen. This does not describe the actual number of homes which seems far more important. It also does not represent an increase in the real size of the economy, in the way that increased company valuations do. Houses are not productive assets.

What am I not taking into consideration?

Edit: thanks all, I can appreciate why a current homeowner might be annoyed if property prices were to stop rising. I still think society as a whole would benefit, but that is the subject of another CMV....

Edit 2: I am still receiving comments after 20 hours which is great, but if you want to change my view at this point you need to say something new. I know values rise faster in some locations than others.",1
CMV: Autism shouldn’t be an excuse for bad behavior,2836,315,2020-04-25 18:52:58," I was misdiagnosed with aspergers when I was in middle school, which means I was put in some sorts of therapies with actually autistic (both « Low » and « high » functioning, not fan of the terms) kids. Some of them were great, just socially awkward like a lot of NTs also are, but most were obnoxious. They’d say horrible things to me and burst into tears when I reacted because they didn’t know they were being offensive. They’d just be disrespectful as fuck. Now, therapy is meant to correct that, but a lot of people with autism keep a bad behavior and public opinion says we’re supposed to accept it because it’s « not their fault ». Dealing with autistic people is not something that everyone is willing to do, and I don’t know why it’s looked down upon to scold an autistic person for acting like an ass. But open to my opinion changing so yeah",1
CMV: People who substitute science-based medicine for things like essential oils deserve no sympathy when it doesn't work,2822,196,2019-02-14 19:08:12,"I was reading an article today ([https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/14/my-patient-swapped-chemotherapy-for-essential-oils-arguing-is-a-fools-errand](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/14/my-patient-swapped-chemotherapy-for-essential-oils-arguing-is-a-fools-errand)) and my reaction was simply ""fuck 'em"". I was surprised that I felt so little compassion and can only attribute it to the rise of things like the anti-vax movement where wilful ignorance amplified by self-selecting echo-chambers is slowly destroying decades of health advances. I feel that people are fundamentally free to make their own decisions, but they should suffer the consequences of those decisions without expectation of any kind of sympathy or understanding from me.",1
CMV: The pay-gap in Women's National Football is fair,2825,890,2019-07-09 15:02:54,"(Unless specifically noted, this post concerns the state of Women's football in the US and Europe)

Obligatory statement of my general views on the broader social issue at play:

* Women have historically faced, and continue to face, unfair labor practices.
* There exists a general pay gap for equal work rendered in most industries, though it is not nearly as large of a gap (nor simple to calculate) as the often-quoted ""$0.72 per $1.00 earned by a man""
* I enjoy Women's football and believe it has proven value in the media/entertainment/cultural landscape.
* I am not persuaded by the argument ""men should be paid more for X sport because the worst men's team would still demolish the best women's team.""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Why I hold this view:**

&#x200B;

* Men's and Women's tournaments in the same sport are NOT ""Equal Work."" The LA Times compared sports teams to assembly line workers who, unarguably, deserve the same pay whether they put together a low-selling commuter car or a blockbuster high-end luxury sedan. But athletes aren't skilled workers, they are performers, and their work is to entertain a *specific audience*. The audience IS the work in this equation! Both Beyonce and Justin Bieber perform live music, but they are not doing equal work even though significant portions of their audience may overlap.

&#x200B;

* In the sports industry, revenue is generated not by the volume of goals scored, but by the volume of people willing to pay to watch it happen and buy products branded to their teams and heroes.

&#x200B;

* The men's World Cup in Russia generated over [$6 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/sports/fifa-revenue.html) in revenue, with the participating teams sharing [$400 million](https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/world-cup-2018-prize-money-how-much-do-the-winners-get-countries-/h9rstxkx3z6k1c8eonct5g1xa), less than 7% of revenue. Meanwhile, the Women's World Cup is expected to earn [$131 million](https://resources.fifa.com/image/upload/fifa-financial-report-2017.pdf?cloudid=pinrmrodexmnqoettgqw) for the full four-year cycle 2019-22 and dole out $30 million to the participating teams... just shy of 23% of revenue. Factoring in the WWC's total team roster at 24 v.s. the MWC's roster of 32, the per-team-per-player revenue share is substantially higher for the Women's teams.

&#x200B;

* Claims that the Women's team in the US brings in more money than the Men's team is cherry-picked data.  This is true for the past few years, but over the long term, the more established men’s game brings in consistently higher game revenue year over year.

&#x200B;

* Revenue sharing does not scale linearly; a fixed percent of revenue for both Men's and Women's tournaments is thus an unfair risk to the governing corporate body (it pains me to say this -- I hate FIFA just as much as everybody). In other words, committing 10% of $100 million in expected revenue is a much greater financial liability than committing 10% of  $1 Billion.

&#x200B;

* Molly Levinson, the spokesperson for the women’s national team said, regarding their lawsuit, “These athletes generate more revenue and garner higher TV ratings but get paid less simply because they are women.”  The data disagree. While the women’s team [broke viewing records](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/sports/soccer/womens-world-cup-final-was-most-watched-soccer-game-in-united-states-history.html?module=inline) in the US during the WWC, ratings for men’s games have been more than double those for women’s games, on average, since 2012, according to Nielsen calculations.  Excluding World Cup games, the men’s team’s ratings are almost four times as high.

&#x200B;

* The US Soccer Federation is genuinely good at rewarding top talent regardless of gender.  According to figures provided by U.S. Soccer, since 2008 it has paid 12 players at least $1 million. Six of those players were men, and six were women.  The best-paid woman made about $1.2 million from 2008 to 2015, while the top man made $1.4 million in the same period. Some women in the top 10 even made *more* than their male counterparts over those years.

&#x200B;

* To qualify for the Women’s World Cup,  the United States women’s team plays five games in a single two-week tournament. The men’s qualifying road is a two-year, 16-game slog across North and Central America and the Caribbean. U.S. Soccer argues that the roster bonuses for successful qualification — $15,000 for the women in 2015, $55,000 for the men in 2014 — reflect that.

&#x200B;

* A wage gap is seen near the bottom of the most paid list when separated by gender.  The No. 25 highest paid  female player made just under $341,000, and the corresponding male player took in $580,000. At No. 50, the male player made 10 times as much as his female counterpart. This is due to the fact that the Men's team plays far more many games per year and are paid by appearance as they earn most of their income from their lucrative club deals.

&#x200B;

* To account for the lack of a profitable Women's professional league in the US (all attempts to establish one have failed thus far), the USSF struck a deal with the women's players union to pay a fixed base salary to each player, regardless of appearances.  A comparable ""pay for play"" structure that is offered to the Men's team would be financially devastating and unfair to the Women's team talent roster. The Men's system results in higher average pay per player, but this is a fair concession to the male players who receive nothing if they are not called to camp.

&#x200B;

* The lion's share of a star athlete's revenue comes from endorsement deals with private companies. NIKE will pay an athlete pari paso to what it thinks it can earn from increased sales. If the pay given to female athletes in these deals is unfair and/or discriminatory based on sex, we would need to see the value generated by such deals against what similar male and female athletes were paid. AFAIK, this data is not available. Further, endorsement deals are entirely based on negotiation -- what is ""fair or unfair"" is subjective to each individual deal and the parties involved.

&#x200B;

* There is good reason to believe that FIFA under-markets, under-supports, and under-invests in the Women's World Cup. In their lawsuit, the US Women's team refers to this as a ""manufactured revenue depression"", but FIFA's failure to fully capitalize on the growing popularity of the Women's World Cup does not mean players are being paid unfairly. It is not unfair to not pay players a share in revenue that doesn't exist because of FIFA's incompetence.

&#x200B;

* FIFA has generally been good at increasing compensation to female players as the popularity (and revenue) of the WWC grows.  Last year, FIFA doubled the prize money for this summer’s Women’s World Cup, to $30 million, and has now pledged to double it again in time for the next edition in 2023.

&#x200B;

* The USWNT's contract with USSF is up for renewal, and they will do everything they can to further the rallying cry of ""equal pay for equal work!"" to achieve its best possible negotiating position. I do not think there is anything wrong with this, other than they are rallying behind what I view as a false claim that the ""pay gap"" is not fair.

&#x200B;

So, let's discuss! I would very much like to change my view on this as I generally don't like to agree with angry voices on the conservative right, but my feelings don't matter. I want to know if the ""wage gap"" in Women's football is fair or not. My view is that it is fair, and is on track to ~~grow~~ be even more favorable to the female players with the increasing popularity of the WWC, but my mind is open!

**UPDATE** **(7/9/19)** \-- Wow! This blew up... there is a lot of great discussion here, so thank you all! I fully intend to keep responding, thinking, and doing additional research (today I would like to dig around USSF data and see if I can get a copy of the USWNT lawsuit to see their arguments.) I will try to keep up as fast as possible, so please forgive me if it takes a while to respond to every comment. I also wish to work to pinpoint as many specific circumstances as possible that would CMV. A big open question I have right now that may lead to some deltas is: ""Why aren't players, male or female, commonly paid XX% of revenue generated by a team or league?""

&#x200B;

**UPDATE (7/10/19) --** still working to read + reply to every substantive comment + take care of my day job! :) Aslo, I got invited to the CMV podcast! Going to speak with the mods now and accept...

&#x200B;

**UPDATE (7/14/19) -**\-

Ok, folks! We have deltas to award, changed and unchanged views to declare, and a helluva lot more understanding of the issue to share and discuss. I’m now ready to make a statement regarding Women’s National Football in the US. I will continue to look into Women’s Football in Europe as I do not yet have enough data nor analysis on this sector... would love for anybody who knows anything about this to chime in.

(Clarifying terminology: I use “National Football” to refer to the National Team that competes against other Nations.)

&#x200B;

Is the pay-gap in Women’s National Football fair? As far as the US is concerned, **my view currently remains unchanged**. However, I also now believe that the current pay-gap is fair but *unreasonable*, and it is in the best interest of the USWNT’s employer (USSF) and FIFA to substantially raise wages + “quality of life” terms for female players + fiscal investment in the Women’s game.

Why I’ve come to this affirmation:

Fair compensation reflects all real and/or potential capital value added to an organization by an employee against the up-front risk the organization must commit.  My analysis considers all forms of capital, including social, marketing, brand awareness, brand value, long and short term returns, etc…

* The current CBA between USWNT and USSF went into effective on 1/1/2017, well after the USMNT meteoric rise.
* The next CBA agreement will go into effect in 2021, and it is incumbent on the USWNT to leverage their strongest bargaining chip (public adoration, changing social attitudes regarding working women, public sympathy) as much as possible to receive the most favorable terms.
* There is little to no risk for the USWNT to stoke public outrage and tie their claim of unfairness to the larger social issue of gender-based wage gaps.
* It has not been demonstrated to me that the work of the Men’s and Women’s teams meet the standards outlined by the Equal Pay Act and Equal Pay Act Title VII, and thus the heuristic “equal pay for equal work” does not apply.
* Assuming the USWNT “quality of life” job benefits are unreasonably lower than the men’s (e.g. no chartered plane travel, frequency of games not played on natural turf, etc…) it has not yet been demonstrated to me that the lack of these perks is the product of unfair labor practices nor gender based discrimination.
* Apples to apples, a pure %-of-revenue based wage for both Men’s and Women’s teams would be on-the-surface fair, but in practice, would overwhelmingly favor USSF at the USWNT’s expense. To this end, the women’s player union has not argued for a pure %-of-revenue model, nor would their members accept one.
* For the past 3 years, the US government office of the EEOC investigated the player’s claims of EPA/EPA Title VII violations at USSF, and did not find sufficient evidence for government intervention (note: such findings DOES NOT mean the USSF is not in violation). Further, the EEOC attempted mediation but these efforts failed.
* Past discrimination of women in Football does not justify greater pay *prima facie.*
* Lack of similar negotiating leverage enjoyed by the Mens team does not, *prima facie,* establish that the deal signed by the USWNT in 2017 is unfair.  Similarly, it does not establish that the deal is fair. The increase in wages paid by USSF to the USWNT does however, indicate USSF acknowledges that what is fair today is not fair tomorrow, especially in the case of elite level performance. This is evidence that the current wage gap is generally fair as it rewards the players for exceptional performance.

&#x200B;

**Some deltas to award…**

I’m going to award deltas to users who changed my thinking and/or prompted me to think about this view from new angles, even if my overall view didn’t change. Delta goes to [damejudyclench](https://www.reddit.com/user/damejudyclench/) for doing the work, providing a thought provoking comparable to consider (Tennis), and pointing me to thought regarding systematic changes that lead to better pay for the Women's teams that are not based on emotional appeal. Back to back world cups is a genuinely good idea worth considering.

&#x200B;

I also want to award a delta to a redditor who argued that the USWNT enters into each contract negotiation with hardly any leverage, so one must be skeptical that the deal on the other end is fair... to this end, it caused me to think about what I consider to be 'fair play' and it changed my ""side-view"" that outcries of 'equal pay for equal work!' from the USWNT were unfair and unreasonable. I cannot find this comment because the thread has gotten so big, but I mentioned that it was brewing a delta for me!

&#x200B;

Delta awarded to [cargdad](https://www.reddit.com/user/cargdad/) for showing me evidence and convincing argumentation that USSF unreasonably failed to invest in youth developmental academies for girls, so much so, that clubs established an unofficial Development Academy out of frustration. If it can be demonstrated that, had USSF not failed to established these programs, that revenue/capital/value generated by NWSL and/or the USWNT today would be substantially or substantively higher, then I will CMV on my OP, top-level claim.

I'm going to reach out to a bunch of them to see if I can find out more about what brought them to that conclusion!",1
CMV: Protests with weapons should not be considered protected freedom of assembly. That's more like threatening terrorism.,2823,955,2020-05-03 02:23:55,"I want to start this off by saying this is not a gun rights argument. I'm personally not a gun rights advocate, but for the sake of this conversation I'm going to remain neutral on things like what types of firearms should be legal, red flag laws, etc. There's a time and place for that discussion and this isn't it.

What I'm chiefly concerned about are demonstrations like what happened in the Michigan capitol yesterday. This could also apply to the previous round of anti-quarantine protests, the Charlottesville marches, or any other large protest where participants chose to bring firearms with them.

In my view, yesterday in particular was not a protest. It was more like an act, or maybe more properly a threat of terrorism. Armed and angry demonstrators stormed the Michigan Capitol building and brandished their guns to legislators and the governor to convey the message that unless the government does what they want, there will be violence.

This is the definition of terrorism - ""the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.""

So while bringing the guns into the capitol isn't itself an act of terror, it's pretty clear what they were threatening. It checks all the boxes. Unlawful violence? Check. Against civilians? Check (politicians are not military). In pursuit of political aims? Check.

The first amendment states that “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble.

What part of carrying assault weapons and threatening violence is peaceful? I don't care how loud or morally wrong or rowdy a protest is, but once weapons are involved the threat of offensive violence against civilians is real. We've moved beyond an era when protests were routinely met with police violence, and taking into consideration who the police were assaulting in those days (black people mostly), the current protestors are not justified in their fears of retaliation. Nowadays, it's almost always ""peaceful"" demonstrators instigating the violence, whether it be the extreme right wingers or extreme left. Adding rifles to that situation just makes everything worse.

It's pretty clear that there's a double standard here along racial lines. These demonstrators aren't flagged as potential terrorists because they're white. I think it's time to treat them like what they really are, a violent faction of anti-government radicals who don't think the law applies to them.

It's a basic principle that violating the law leads to consequences. It has been upheld numerous times in court that a threat can be deemed an assault, and there are laws specifically against threatening government officials. So whatever you want to call these demonstrators - criminals, terrorists, disturbances to the peace - they have acted in a way that violates the law and the constitution and they should be held accountable.

"CMV: If you deliberately falsely accuse someone of a crime, you should recieve rhe punishment that the accused would have recieved, if they had been found guilty, plus the scentence for perjury.",2814,416,2019-06-09 01:09:34,"Lets say, for sake of argument, person X accuses person Y of crime A. X knows that Y did not commit this crime, but X does not like Y. X mmakes a seemingly valid case, with made up stories, and fake evidence. 

Lets say crime A has an average scentence of 10 years. The jury is about to convict Y, when new evidence is found, that shows that X made up these claims.

Y is immediately acquitted, and X is charged with perjury. The formula for X's scentence is as follows:

the scentence Y would have recieved if found guilty of crime A + an appropriate scentence for perjury + financial compensation for the damages associated with being falsely accused of a crime.

Reasons for this:
- discourages the use of false accusations as a form of revenge
- increases the integrity of court hearings, as no one in their right mind would lie to court.
- saves the government money, as they have less court cases over false accusations.

What would change my view:
- demonstrating that this is in some way unfair

CMV: Most people tend to conflate criticism of Israel and Islam as anti semitism and islamophobia respectively.,2812,605,2019-11-10 23:06:39,"There is a lot of difference between criticism of Israel and anti-semitism, similarly criticism of Islam is different from islamophobia.

I think that most people tend to conflate criticism of Israel with anti-semitism. Whenever I criticize the human rights violation and military violence perpetrated by Israel on Palestine citizens, I am labelled as an anti-semite. I think that this is an unhealthy attitude as it shuts down the way for any constructive debates. I don't think that there is any anti-semitism in the  controversial tweet of Ilhan Omar on Israel Lobby, but her old tweet on 'Israel hypnotizing the world' seems to be anti-semitic.

This is not just confined to anti-semitism, but can also be extended to islamophobia. Most people tend to conflate the criticism of Islam with anti Muslim bigotry. I believe that questioning the patriarchy or misogyny in islam is not tantamount to hating muslims . No ideology should be immune from any sort of criticism and frivolously invoking labels such as anti semitic or islamophobic to evade from criticisms is an intellectually lazy thing to do.

I am against inciting hatred against any communities, and I acknowledge that anitisemitism and islamophobia are indeed a pertinent issue that needs to be addressed and tackled, but we should at the same time, discern the dichotomy between criticism and bigotry",1
CMV: Americans are far too focused on stressful occupations and have a brutal life to work ratio,2807,256,2020-03-27 04:44:26,"Most people explain the American Dream as the opportunity to come from nothing and have the chance to get everything. While this might be true, people do not realize the rigorous trade offs this entails.

Life in America begins with the stressful environment of school. Most school's weekly schedules are five days a week with days lasting from 8AM until 3PM. After this 7 hour school day, student’s days are consumed with their required homework and various other extracurricular activities they may have. This leaves them with minimal free time and maximum anxiety. Most of this anxiety spawns from the fact that the work students do in their teenage/high school years can affect their future on a large scale. America is structured in a way where if students do not perform well on their tests and get into an elite college, they will significantly reduce their chances of success in their adult years. This constant stress thrown upon young students is indicative of what they will continue to face in the future.

This pressure put on students is at an all time high, and the numbers support this claim. Depression in American students increased by a staggering 37 percent from 2005 to 2014 (source). In addition, two-thirds of college students reported they are experiencing overwhelming anxiety, which is up 50 percent from five years ago (source). Does it sound like we are acting upon this issue? The increased trend of mental health issues is at the forefront of many institution's discussions, yet they fail to change their structure stop the issue at the source.

Even after college, the life to work ratio is just as overwhelming. The average American works about 9 hours a day, which means 45 hours of their week is dedicated to their job. On top of this, the average employee retires when they are 63 years old and the life expectancy of an American is 78.74. This means that, on average, about 80 percent of American’s weekdays are solely dedicated to working in high stress environments. Although some people may love their jobs, time for leisure is imperative to maintain a healthy life.

The obvious counter argument to this is, how can a country continue to grow and become more advanced if they do not work tirelessly? Germany, for example, has a 35 hour weekly work schedule and enjoys 24 paid vacation days per year. Despite these short work hours, Germany is the leader in the industrial industry within Europe, and is also the leading manufacturer of goods imported by Asian nations (Source). Furthermore, the depression rate in American adults is 17 percent, compared to Germany’s 9 percent. Germany works less, has great success in many industries, and has one of the lowest depression rates in the world (Source).

This all comes back to the life to work ratio mentioned previously. Germans have more time to enjoy different hobbies, explore the world, and meet with family and friends than Americans do. The American society is obsessed with success and money, and people do not leave enough time for the things that they truly love. Every human is on the pursuit of happiness throughout their life, and that pursuit is inhibited by American ideals.",1
"CMV: Vilification of politicians changing positions ""flip-flopping"" is not a healthy political environment",2805,170,2019-10-14 19:12:35,"I can fully understand not wanting your politicians to sway in favour of whichever way the wind blows at any given time. Most of the reason that this happens is because people want to believe that their choice of politician has and always had held the views that you like because it means they're unlikely to change. But on the other hand, if a politician had an outlook on a topic that was ultimately mistaken, if they change their mind it shouldn't be a question of their character.  

For example politicians that were for the iraq war have that used against them constantly. But they're unable to flat out say they were wrong because that's seen as being a flip-flop, when more realistically it's just a change in policy in response to new available evidence. Nobody's denying that the iraq war was bad - but if a politician admits they made a mistake they will instantly be clapped by not just the media but the average joe as well. This seems like a pretty toxic environment in which nobody can truly achieve change. The purpose of political discourse should be so that everyone can gain a deeper understanding of the topics being discussed.  

EDIT: Finished responding. My view hasn't been fully changed - I still think the accusation of being a flip flopper is flimsy and meaningless, but I think I overestimated how much politicians are attacked for percieved flops.",1
CMV: it is a jerk move to play music while camping within earshot of other campers.,2800,445,2018-09-03 07:22:42,"We put a tent up in a state park campground for about 4 weeks out of the summer. Most of the time you can just hear nature, people talking, kids playing, lots of birds and squirrels  . Every 5th day or so, there is someone who brings some Bluetooth speakers so they can listen to music , but loud  enough  that people in a half dozen sites nearby get to ‘enjoy’ whatever they are playing. 

Right now I’m cooking dinner and the guys next to me are playing U2, Dave Matthew Band and similar inoffensive crap.

This would be entirely normal in a backyard gathering, but once you reserve to be in a public campground, it becomes selfish, intrusive,  rude.

Am I wrong?

CMV: Martin Shkreli (the creepy drug price hike guy) is a humbling reminder that Internet outrage is totally powerless to affect anything that matters,2803,255,2015-12-12 20:45:45,"**edit3: I had to delete most of my comments due to an unrelated problem. My view has still been changed, and all deltas were legitimately awarded and deserved. Sorry for any inconvenience caused.**

**edit2: In an ironic turn of fate it appears that Shkreli has in fact been arrested as of 2015/12/17. Whether he will be convicted is up for debate but it's quite possible he may be punished for his actions. I've already given out a lot of deltas but this is the final nail on the coffin on my view, so to speak.**

People seem to think that liking things on facebook or being outraged on reddit has an effect on the real world. The only cases where I've found this to be true is when redditors tormented a family who had nothing to do with the Boston Marathon Bombing, or other events where someone did something the websites didn't like and got canned for it such as the dongles joke. It's only the witch hunts on *defenseless* people that work.  

In practice, when it comes to things that actually matter, nothing can be done by online petitions. Martin Shkreli is one such example, no one on reddit can do anything about him despite their rage. The witch hunt fails because he is actually powerful. In fact, sharing things online and clicking the like button probably makes you less likely to actually do anything in real life because of the feeling that you have already contributed. That is why slacktivism is dangerous. People have this mindset that one like = one dead terrorist. In reality, the salient topic is forgotten within days, to be replaced by a vine or some other controversy.  

Another worrying trend is that online communities are easily manipulated. All you have to do is pay a few interns to flood comment sections. In fact there is a theory that Shkreli himself has played the internet like a fiddle (I can't find the post detailing this anymore unfortunately) There is a 100% chance that I have been manipulated like this in the past myself without being aware of it, usually it's by advertising astroturf. It's hardly an elaborate tinfoil conspiracy, simply an online medium that is trivially easy to game. It means you have the illusion of being informed when in fact you are ensconcing yourself in an echo chamber. Look at any political themed subreddit to find evidence of this.  

If you have at least a few examples of online outrage achieving something positive and durable, or some other hard evidence, please share and I'll be willing to change my view.

edit: there is an onslaught of new comments and I can't keep up. Will tune in later.

You can list all the good things she's done but plenty of non royals have done just as much, if not more, good. The only reason people treat her the way they do, and why she has the lifestyle she has, is because she was born into it, same for any other royal. We shouldn't give respect to the extent we give royalty to people who've done nothing to deserve it. (I'd also argue that nobody deserves to be treated in such a manner, but that's a different cmv)

"CMV: If there is a near identical, affordable, healthy, synthetic alternative to a certain meat, there is very little excuse to eat the real thing.",2791,831,2019-05-07 22:39:37,"I would like to start off saying I am an active meat lover. I love bacon, steak, porkchops, really any meat I would try (and probably like).

Recently, scientific advancements have been made for the improvement of synthetic meats. Soon enough it will probably be so good its virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. Right now its extremely expensive to make, but projections show it could actually be way cheaper than the real thing. For example, some ""meats"" have been grown in 3 months! (This is great compared to the years it takes to raise cattle). I have also found a way tastier, healthy alternative to mayo that is only around 20 cents pricier than the real thing. Also, synthetic meats dont pollute!

CMV: Oranges are significantly better than apples,2784,235,2019-05-06 16:40:08,"Let's be honest, comparing apples to oranges is actually pretty easy, oranges are far superior in many ways:

Most oranges have a stronger flavor than most apples, it's fairly easy to find an orange so sweet yet tart, that the flavor is almost overpowering, I don't think I've ever had an apple that was as strong as the average orange

Oranges have a higher liquid content, while a large percentage of apples will be too dry

Oranges are segmented, you don't have to slice them up like an apple, talk about convenience! Apple = hassle

Oranges? More like ""no core-anges""! With an apple you end up with even more hassle in the form of a core, who wants a fruit that leaves you with responsibilities?

The apple-eating experience is sub par, especially if you don't pre-slice it. Unless you cut it up before eating, you have to chomp into the whole thing like a stupid dumb horse. The skin gets stuck in your teeth and slices up your gums, if I wanted slices in my gums I would eat staples. Apples = Staples

If you eat the whole thing, you have to decide when to stop. The conclusion of an apple is unsatisfying, it just gets weirder and less flavorful and then you eventually have to decide to stop eating. You don't finish an apple, you give up on it. And then you ask yourself ""should I have eaten more of that apple? Am I a terrible person for throwing 3 grams of edible fruit away?""

And have you ever heard of a color called 'apple'? Didn't think so! Another point for oranges

Oh and I almost forgot, oranges don't turn brown a minute after you open them. I probably forgot that part because why the heck is that a thing? What kind of crappy fruit would do that? Apples would do that. Apples = crapples

Whoever invented the apple should be fired, we need to make room for more orange-ventors

Oranges > > > Apples",1
CMV: Sexuality is blown out of proportion.,2777,372,2019-11-18 00:07:52,"Sexuality has become a heated political and social issue and I have no idea why. In my opinion, it shouldn't matter who or what you fuck. Your sexuality only defines a fraction of daily life, like any other personal trait about you, so why is it that so many make their world revolve around their sexuality? I've seen children who are new to dating, and certainly too young to have sex, claiming their sexuality (including straight). Why? Grow up and mature before making those kinds of decisions. 

We now have flags, marches, anthems, symbols, protests, bathrooms, etc. all because people decided that who they fuck defines their entire character and they need to share it with the world for whatever reason.

Disclaimer: I respect your decision to be attracted to whoever or whatever you want (to an extent, of course).

Edit: I see now that ""sexuality being blown out of proportion"" is for people to feel loved and accepted within their own community. I've changed my view.",1
"CMV: 'Jump scares' are a cheap party trick, and movies that are full of them shouldn't be considered horror",2779,173,2016-06-21 03:30:32,"

Lately I've noticed that most horror movies rely on jump scares. Something will unexpectedly pop out at the audience, a loud noise will startle everyone, you know the works. Sometimes the movie tries to trick people into believing that a certain scene will have a jump scare, to make the viewer feel safe, and then do a jump scare in the next scene.

I think that movies like Paranormal Activity, The Conjuring and The Darkness do not do their best to scare the audience in a creative way.

Jump scares do something physical to your body. Sometimes my mom jumps out at the me when I walk through the door, to elicit a scream or a 'fear' reaction from me. However, a second later I'm just laughing because it's silly and not at all scary.

When I go see a movie at the theater that has a lot of jump scares, most of the audience members just seem to be laughing. You may hear a collective gasp or a scream, but that's just a reflex. 

Most movies riddled with jump scares do not leave an impression on me. I find them annoying.

Jump scares do not tell a story that sends shivers down your spine and causes you to lay awake at night. Jump scares do not show you a gruesome scene that will be burned into your mind for the weeks to come.

Jump scares are cheap party tricks. They are annoying and do not elicit any feelings of terror.

"CMV: Social Media is the worst thing to happen to the developed world in this century, and there is nothing we can do about it",2759,284,2018-04-15 21:39:47,"Before I even get into the recent scandals, here is why I think it's bad for us

1. It is addictive. Positive feedback loops are created with likes, karma, retweets, notes, whatever you want. This makes people want to stay on the website. The infinite scrolling makes us lose the track of time and stay longer on the website. The constant flow of notifications makes us come back on an app as often as possible. All of this exploits human weaknesses to make us more addicted to whatever platform we're on.
2. That in itself wouldn't be a bad thing if it was good for us, or at least harmless, but it's not. A [study from researchers of the University of Pittsburg](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/da.22466?referrer_access_token=Hi1QLynsIJ5tuI6-1zT4KE4keas67K9QMdWULTWMo8PvTNwDJXlfYQ5HHAKSAL63jtTzqdZyeosmdCcyWyqK_7I_cheVaAwAgj6k_qaCKxqvwJ13lN0tQ7HJ-mepXBSo) show that social media makes us sadder, angrier and more vulnerable to depression or anxiety.
3. There is no escaping them. Facebook especially, it has become so omnipresent and does so many things that it has become an inconvenience for other people if someone isn't on Facebook. Parties are organised there, money is exchanged, Messenger is by far the most popular messaging app in the world. Everyone is on there so why wouldn't you ? This is called the [Network effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) and it is why there is no escaping Facebook. I've been  thinking about leaving Facebook for a year now and I pretty much don't use it, but I never have because of peer pressure. That is my responsibility but I'm sure I'm not alone here
4. It has turned everything we read and watched into quick bites that are only made to make you feel some way. Because of that positive feedback loop I mentioned in point 1, we expect that kind of dopamine rush from everything. Most people only read the title of articles, no matter how clickbait\-y they can be. The news have been condensed into videos only a couple of minutes long that usually aren't made to inform, but that are made to give some feeling to the viewer, so that they keep watching more stuff. This imo the main reason why people are angry when they use social media : anger sells. This problem arguably doesn't just come from social media but this is definitely a big part of it.
5. And finally I get to the streak of scandals we've seen about Twitter, Facebook or Reddit in the past two years. About the Russian bots, about Cambridge Analytica. That last one has made me absolutely terrified about how well social media can be used to brainwash people. This is what makes AI dangerous, the fact that we can now change people's opinions by using human weaknesses. I'm not developping this post too much because there is still a lot that I need to understand but the more I read about this and the more terrified I am of social media

Now I might sound like my parents, ten years ago, telling me that the internet is bad. But most of what I said above is empirically backed research. Here is the opinion bit, and what I'd like to debate : we can't fight this. No matter how much we keep warning people about how Facebook brainwashes their users, only a fraction of people are actually gonna pay attention because we all like to believe that we're smarter than that. 

I've always been very optimistic when it comes to technology. I'd like to stay that way, but I'm having trouble.

There are two debatable things here, the fact that social media is bad and the fact we can't do anything about it. Feel free to challenge me on both points, I want to be more optimistic about this.

EDIT : Bit of an update because I'm having trouble keeping up with the flow of comments. I have changed my view significantly so thanks everyone for the comments. I'll give deltas when I have a bit more time on my hands but be sure that I will. Here's where I stand now :

Social media is still terrible. The way they are now and the harm that they currently do don't make up for the benefits. But because we are aware of the problems they have things might change. I also overestimated the inescapability of Facebook, because I'm French and here it is almost inescapable, but you guys are giving me hope. Also my title is absolutely terrible, sorry.

Also I think I haven't made clear that I don't hate technology, I love it. Self driving cars are my dream. And the internet has given us some great things, Patreon helps artists, Spotify ended music piracy, etc. My animosity was only directed at social media, mostly Facebook, Twitter, instagram, and the likes.

Thanks everyone for taking the time. This is a conversation we need to have.",1
CMV: The glorification of victimhood and/or marginalization status by some is a bad precedent for society moving forward.,2757,310,2020-04-01 07:16:02,"Over the course of the last few years, I've seen an ever-increasing push for the idea that those who have been victimized in some way, shape, or form, should be propped up and promoted by society.  While I understand the fact that this is all rooted in sympathy, and in many instances has done great good for society, the ideology behind it (as I've noticed) has grown increasingly... rigid?  It's hard for me to put into words, but basically the idea is that people blindly rally behind the 'less fortunate', and proceed to push a narrative that because they are less fortunate, society should do all that it can to rectify the situation.

The idea is not inherently bad, I don't believe, but in many cases I've noticed that society sometimes writes metaphorical 'blank checks' to those who have been victimized, where if they have an opinion, you are not allowed to challenge that opinion, unless you yourself are a victim, lest you hurt somebody's feelings.  For example, if two people are having an argument about say, domestic abuse, and one of the person has personally been a victim of domestic abuse, then the common thread I see far too often is that even if the victim has incorrect or dubious claims as to the facts involving domestic abuse, that social pressure dictates that you don't contradict them, or you're an insensitive asshole.

I've also seen it arise in situations such that rather than helping victims, it becomes easier or more convenient to shame or silence those who aren't victims (which is especially egregious when combined with intersectionality to assume who is and is not a victim based off of certain aspects).  For example, I've often been in groups of people (friends, coworkers, fellow students, what have you), where when people bring up harassment or discrimination that they've faced, that when I bring up instances in which it's happened to me, I'm shut down with 'you're a man, get over it' or 'well you're white, so it probably wasn't that bad' and things along those lines, as if because my 'group' is not traditionally marginalized, then I'm not allowed sympathy.

It's gotten to a point that sometimes people consciously 'play up' bad things that have happened to them, in order to extract as much pity as possible from a society in which pity ironically becomes power.  Rant aside, the reason I think it sets a bad precedent is 1) The constant vying to be the most oppressed person in the room creates a culture where we constantly dwell on the problems in our lives, because if you work past a problem and put it behind you, then you've voluntarily discarded a social asset.  This can create negative outlooks at best, and cause situations in which individuals actively look for ways in which they can become victims at worst.  2)  It is a bad idea to run a society based off the views of the most marginalized, to the exclusion of those who are not.  Should the marginalized have a say?  Absolutely.  But everybody should have a say on things, and if not everybody, then the experts should.  The thing is, that being a victim of something doesn't inherently make you an expert on how to fix something, anymore than being a perpetrator would.  We shouldn't form our opinions on whether vaccines are good or not entirely based off the personal experience of that one mother whose child died because of a rare side effect of vaccination.  3) (and this is my weakest held argument, just something that slightly concerns me) For all of human history, society favored strength, and weakness was something to be hidden.  It was unwise to bare your vulnerabilities, lest they be used against you.  A society which favors showing the world your every scar in order to gain social acceptance stands juxtaposed to the human condition, and it worries me that at some point society could revert to the historical norm and all these vulnerabilities that people posted on the internet years ago be dug up and used against them.

&#x200B;

All this being said, I am NOT against showing sympathy and/or empathy to those who have suffered.  I only take issue with taking things further and giving victims special social privileges.",1
CMV: Toilet paper quality is a direct reflection of how much an institution cares about their students/employees/etc.,2747,240,2018-04-13 04:19:13,"Truthfully I'm not really sure what kinds of arguments will go against this so I'm excited to see what people say here.

Some background info - I'm in college and I attend a university that has recently become notorious for not caring about individual students. 

This is a public school so I understand funding restrictions, but I'm aware that the administration makes quite a bit of money. Meanwhile, I'm trying to type term papers at the library, and it's hard to sit down because my ass is so sore from how shitty (pun intended) the toilet paper is. Spending such a ridiculous amount on my education leads me to believe that I, and all of the other students and faculty, deserve the best quality toilet paper available in bulk, and the only reason that this isn't the case is because the school doesn't give a shit (lol) about us.

Another example - I've been fortunate to work a variety of jobs in different sized businesses and the same holds true. You'd think that an employer would cut costs like toilet paper in order to pay their employees more, but in reality the places I earned the most money at had the best toilet paper. 

I know that a lot of this is personal experience, but I can't help but notice the pattern.

So reddit, Change my shitty view!

**EDIT**: Wow I didn't realize this would blow up so much. I'm going to give out deltas for the following arguments but only to the first few people who made them.

1. The plumbing argument: I realize that I have no idea how plumbing works, so if toilet paper quality is really such a big issue for plumbing that this many people are saying so, I believe it.

2. Institutions that provide good benefits with bad tissue: While I'm taking this one with a grain of salt, as individual experiences can vary by position or status within an institution, I realize that the crux of my argument is based in a generalization that probably isn't entirely true.

I'm not going to be able to respond to all of these comments that are saying the same thing so basically if you commented one of those things within the first 25 or so comments (as there are a lot of repeats), I'll find your comment and give you your delta.

CMV: Legalise all soft drugs and decriminalise all other drugs,2739,518,2019-05-09 17:24:01,"I would like to argue for legalising soft drugs (cannabis, tobacco, alcohol?, MDMA, psilocybin, and other psychedelics) and decriminalise hard drugs(heroin, opium, alcohol?, etc). Most health risks associated with soft drugs arises from prohibition. Drugs such as cannabis, MDMA, and all psychedelics are not deadly whatsoever in their pure, unlaced states and the best way to prevent drug deaths is through education and keeping drugs pure or unlaced. Legalisation would ensure safe access to these soft drugs and people would have the guarantee that their drugs are safe to use. As for the hard drugs, education, overdose prevention and addiction support are the best option. Supplying drugs such as naloxone widely, reduces the majority of overdoses.

If governments spent the amount of money they spent on ""The War on Drugs"" on the healthcare side of drugs, the use of drugs, the dangers of drugs, and addiction would all be reduced. On another note, drug users are NOT criminals. They are addicts that should be helped and supported, NOT imprisoned. It is extremely immoral, and creates other issues such as mass incarceration.

Here is how I suggest it should be carried out: (I am open to suggestions so please reply if you have a better alternative)

Step 1: Focus extremely heavily on research on all common recreational drugs. This would require laws being changed so research is allowed. The research should especially focus on the mental health aspect. 

Step 2: Experts agree on which drugs should be decriminalised and which should be legalised. This will be decided on many factors like potential for abuse, harm to user, harm to others, affect on mental capacity, typical characteristics of the moods it causes, etc. 

Step 3: Once the classifications are agreed upon, we can proceed. Start educating everyone in public schools about harm reduction on common drugs and try and remove stigma as much as possible. 

Step 4: Create and regulate the legal markets of the legalised drugs whilst ensuring that regulation isn’t too heavy so that the black market doesn’t compete. 

Step 6: Set up centers for decriminalised substances where users can safely consume under medical supervision and the drugs will be supplied by the government for free. If users prefer to use the drugs outside this environment, they may do so however, if seen consuming drugs, they can be referred to addiction help. Make sure that anti-overdose medication and clean syringes are widely available. 


Edit: Just to be clear, decriminalisation of hard drugs only decriminalises personal users, NOT drug dealers or suppliers.",1
"CMV: keeping children ""innocent"" is detrimental to their development",2734,190,2019-11-01 20:49:46,"I am M/24 and thinking about having kids in the next 3-4 years. 

One of the concepts that I've always disagreed with is ""robbing kids of their innocence."" I just don't feel like time spent being innocent is important to have a fulfilling childhood. Also, kids that did have their innocence taken away early on - such as the age of 4-12 grow up with more maturity and develop better ability to handle complex situations effectively. 

I understand this could put a lot of pressure on young minds and could have detrimental effects - some situations where I would treat the child as an adult vs. where I wouldn't;

If I can afford food, clothing and shelter, then I will explain to my child if we are poor/rich and how it impacts us. If we are barely scaping by, I would try to make them understand that while its unfair, its how life is right now - that things can change.

 I would teach my kids about death as a natural process if a distant relative died, but I wouldn't tell them their dog died because that could cause emotional trauma. 

These lessons would have the most impact on a younger mind, I would have to be careful not to say anything disturbing but I believe its well worth the effort.

I believe you should take away a child's innocence if it can be done in a healthy way. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My dad was blunt with me, he ran a business and would come home stressed when his accounts receivable was adding up. We had bills and mortgage to pay and he was very transparent about not being able to meet payments. It made me value money more, question why things cost as much as they do and I think I have a better understanding than others from an early age. 

While it did cause stress, it gave me a head start when compared to the blissfully ignorant kids that could not understand why their parents wouldn't buy what they wanted - these were the kids saying shit like ""my moms a b\*tch."" When my dad said NO to buying an Xbox, I understood and didn't pester him, I didn't throw a tantrum because I understood he would have bought me one if he could. My innocence wasn't robbed, I was taught the importance of spending when you don't have it. Later down the line, I did end up getting an Xbox, just had to wait an additional 8 months for my dad to have that kind of discretionary spending (\~$400). 

Should I not take opportunities to teach my kids about gender inequality, stereotyping, financial stability, death, being born lucky, war, drug abuse, or grandparents going senile? (just some examples off the top of my head). 

All for the sake of innocence, which I just don't see any benefits to. I feel like it should be my parental duty to teach these things in a warm and supportive environment and not let life be the only teacher.

CMV: Solving a Rubik's cube in the fewest moves is far a more impressive intellectual feat than solving it quickly,2732,264,2019-06-19 16:02:01,"I will preface this by saying that I have nothing against speedcubing and speedcubers. It is highly impressive that people can solve scrambled cubes in a matter of seconds, and I respect all those who dedicate their lives to mastering the art of solving them quickly. There is no denying that it takes a huge amount of training, skill, and manual dexterity to become a competitive speedcuber.

That being said, I believe that being able to solve any given permutation of the cube in the fewest moves is a far more impressive intellectual feat (and one that should be valued more in competitions). Speedcubers are fast because they can recognise patterns quickly and are able to apply memorised algorithms. This takes a lot of practice, but is ultimately a question of experience. As you become more familiar with different permutations of the cube, you develop a 'feel' for which algorithms to apply and can rapidly execute them as a result. 

On the other hand, I am under the impression that fewest-move solves are much more difficult to master, since there are no fixed 'solving methods' for any given arrangement of the cube. It becomes an exercise in trying to develop your own algorithms on the fly so as to minimise the number of moves you will need, as opposed to an exercise in quickly applying algorithms that you have already memorised. In a sense this makes it more like solving a Rubik's cube 'au naturel' - without having read up on algorithms at all - a task that very few would be able to accomplish. In my view this makes it much more intellectually stimulating and challenging than speedsolving, and is why I believe that fewest-move solves should be the centrepiece of Rubik's cube competitions. CMV.

EDIT: I've just woken up and have received a tremendous number of replies, from cubers and non-cubers alike. Thank you all for your input; I've really enjoyed reading your replies even though I haven't had the chance to respond to all of them. The replies I have received from those experienced in both events have been the most enlightening. I gather it looks like I'm underestimating the amount of algorithmic thought required for fewest move count solves and oversimplifying the process of speedsolving. I'm not sure I've reversed my opinion just yet but it does give me something to think about. I also no longer think there is a valid basis for valuing what is perceived to be the more 'intellectual' event in cubing competitions.",1
CMV: The Xbox-style controller layout is ergonomically superior to that of the Playstation,2730,300,2019-09-06 22:27:11,"Specifically, I am talking about the Xbox's offset thumbsticks compared to the Playstation's symmetrical design, with both sticks in the lower area.

The upper left position--where the Xbox has the left thumbstick and the PS has the d-pad--is the most easily accessible area for the left thumb. When gripping a controller as intended, it is where the thumb naturally rests. It requires less of a stretch of a thumb, which allows for greater comfort, less fatigue and possibly even more precision.

The PS1 controller may have had good reason to keep the d-pad in the upper left. At the time, we were still making the transition to games that were reliant on thumbsticks. However, now the left thumbstick tends to be the primary directional control.

We can assume that the ""big 3"" console makers have expert ergonomics consultants. Indeed, I know that Microsoft does with respect to Xbox, because I worked for an engineering/ergonomics firm that was consulted on this matter (I did not personally work on the project). Both Microsoft and Nintendo (in the Switch itself and the Switch Pro controller) have opted for the off-set design.

As for Sony, I recall reading that they considered going to the offset design for the PS4, but decided that the current design is too iconic and central to their image. In other words, as a business decision, they prioritized aesthetics. I remember reading this story during the early PS4 days, but now I can't find it.

I believe that most unbiased people will prefer the Xbox design. Indeed, there are several kinds of third-party Ps4 controllers with offset thumbsticks, while Xbox users who want to use a parallel stick design don't have many options. Naturally, many say they prefer the Sony design because it is what they are accustomed to. And there are always exceptions, especially due to how people grip the controller. But for most, the PS4 controller is ergonomically inferior.

**Edit:** There were some great responses. I couldn't quite give out a Delta because nobody changed my view, but there's still time. Also, PM me if you play Apex Legends on PSN (it's my only console, and yes, I play with a Dual Shock!). I suck but I'd rather not play with randoms. Pathfinder is my main.

**Edit 2: The error many people are making here is comparing the actual Xbox controller to the Dual Shock 4. Please do not do that. In fact, forget Xbox and Sony. Think of a Nintendo Switch Pro controller. My contention here is that the left stick above the d-pad (where it currently is) is superior to a hypothetical Switch Pro controller where the left stick is below the d-pad.**",1
"CMV: When someone gets upset about the suffering of dogs but are indifferent to the suffering of animals in factory farms, they are being logically inconsistent.",2728,813,2018-10-25 04:52:45,"I love my dogs, whenever I see my little pups in pain it hurts me. However, I also think that the suffering that, as a matter of fact, goes on in factory farms is horrific. Here on Reddit there are many instances of people justly showing disgust an instance of abuse towards a pet animal while then hating on vegans who say that they should show similar concern for pigs, cows, etc.  

To get upset at the suffering of a single dog, say, and be indifferent towards the horrors of factory farming is a kind of cognitive dissonance. It is to not have the suffering going on be salient in your mind. It seems to me that we should have concern for the suffering for all animals.

Imagine a factory farm with golden retrievers instead of pigs. You probably would be rightly upset. Why should we not hold the same or even a similar standard towards pigs, cows, etc.?


Edit: This was a really interesting post! Everyone had some thoughtful points to raise. I think I realize why this issue is tough to reconcile with some of of the points that were brought up: because I *do* believe in a kind of objective morality. Not a religious one, but a secular one (there is a rich history of secular ethics that is worth diving into a bit).

That's obviously not the only point of disagreement, but maybe one of the bigger ones.

I believe that the rabbit in the Trix commercials should be allowed to eat Trix cereal. CMV.,2732,402,2013-12-31 09:57:55,"For as long as I can remember, the TV commercials for Trix cereal have followed the same pattern: a well-meaning white rabbit wants nothing more than to enjoy the supposed deliciousness of Trix cereal, but his attempts are repeatedly shut down by antagonistic children who, without fail, close with the catch phrase ""silly rabbit, Trix are for kids!""

I believe that these commercials (specifically because of the fact that the rabbit is consistently forbidden from enjoying Trix cereal) lead to the following ill effects:

* They encourage (to a target audience of children, no less) exclusivity and discrimination towards those who fall outside of one's own demographic ('kids,' in this case). 

* They frustrate viewers who are empathetic with the Rabbit and want to see him find happiness.

* They are arguably counterproductive; I refuse to buy Trix cereal until the rabbit begins receiving fair treatment in Trix commercials, and I would imagine I am not the only one. 

Change my view.

CMV: the majority of the population won't be correctly represented in politics until there is a major political education reform,2718,245,2019-06-25 23:00:54,"Political education seems irrelevant and not a subject of conversation when it is one of the most urgent matters that should be taken care of.

Most people ""don't care about politics"" or are massively misinformed in how politics and government works and as long as this situation remains the average person will not be protected and correctly represented in politics.

As of right now campaign funding is too closely related to popularity of a politician because it is basically a way of reaching out and influence an uniformed, or at least, not totally informed population which gives more power to the richest and companies instead of the ""power"" being distributed throughout the whole population.

The best way to fight this is obligatory (taught in school) political education that guarantees that every citizen knows how politics work, general ideologies, how government works, political strategies and bring awareness to the fact that political involvement is not only a right but a duty of everyone.

My post is not only about the US but the idea globaly, even if we can use the US as an example.

CMV: YouTube Kids should be based on a whitelist of approved channels.,2715,106,2017-11-12 23:25:31,"You might have heard about the controversy associated with YouTube Kids, which has [frequently suggested bizarre and often disturbing and/or violent cartoons for children and parents.](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/9/16629788/youtube-kids-distrubing-inappropriate-flag-age-restrict) Very many of these cartoons show iconic, copyrighted characters engaging in out-of-character behavior, including [depictions of Elsa engaging in gun violence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDgokvFC_-E). These videos are quite controversial and can be traumatizing to children, and furthermore may harm iconic and beloved brands. 

If YouTube is going to be explicitly branding towards children, they need to ensure that every video they offer is both a) child-friendly and b) depicts characters in a way that's consistent with their creators' intentions. I'm not at all opposed to fanfiction, but Elsa robbing a bank is not something that is child-friendly and not something that fits with Disney's intention or reputation at all. What I think should happen is that YouTube Kids should be limited to channels that are reviewed by humans who are employed by a reputable firm (either YouTube employees or the firms whose intellectual property is being used) and verified to ensure that they are age appropriate.

CMV: People are too sensitive when it comes to cultural appropriation and it's actually harmless,2703,464,2020-06-09 16:13:45,"I am posting this to get educated as I think I might be missing the bigger picture. As a disclaimer I never did what a people refer to as ""cultural appropriation"" but these thoughts are what comes to mind as an observer.

Edit: Racism is a very sensitive topic, especially nowadays, I DON'T think blackface and such things are harmless, I am mainly talking about things similar to the tweet I linked. Wearing clothes that are part of another culture, doing a dance that is usually exclusive to another culture, and such.

First, let's take a look at the definition of cultural appropriation (source: wikipedia):

>**Cultural appropriation**, at times also phrased **cultural misappropriation**, is the adoption of an element or elements of one **culture** by members of another **culture**. This can be controversial when members of a dominant **culture** appropriate from disadvantaged minority **cultures**.

What I real don't get is what's the harm in it? For example [this](https://twitter.com/daumkeziah/status/988115815068139520) tweet sparked a lot of controversy because of cultural appropriation but what's the harm in this? She is someone who liked the dressed so she wore it. If someone wears something part of my culture I'd actually take it positively as that means people appreciate my culture and like it.

Globalization has lead to a lot of things that were exclusively related to one culture spread around the world, I guess that most of these things aren't really traditional but it's still is a similar concept.

I get that somethings don't look harmful on the surface but actually are harmful when someone digs into it (example: some ""dark jokes"" that contribute to racism/rape culture or such) but I still can't see how this happens in this topic which is something I am hoping will change by posting here.

"CMV: Lots of people say they support those with mental illnesses, but are really not tolerant of the way mental illnesses actually play out.",2702,297,2019-11-01 05:45:18,"First, as a disclaimer, I am not saying that all people do this but I have noticed that many do.

What I mean by this statement is that there are a lot of people who say that they support and want to help those who have mental illnesses such as anxiety, depression, etc... but I think a lot of people are really not tolerant to the ways that they are played out in people who actually have the issues. For example, I have generalized anxiety as well as health anxiety and it is very cyclical for me. I will go through times where I am doing great and then one day it will randomly hit more or a thought will pop up in my head and I will spiral. After that, it's generally at least a week to a month that I will have a bout of anxiety.

My anxious states are not the overt view of anxiety that I think a lot of individuals have. I don't have loud panic attacks where I hyperventilate and show that it is happening to me. My panic attacks generally feel more like my heart is slowing down and I will get very lightheaded and feel like I have to lie down. When I am just having generalized anxiety it will usually play itself out in things like; me wanting to be by myself, being more irritable, being quieter, being spacey or not being able to focus very well and almost having a disassociate type state. 

The issue here is that I think a lot of people are very willing to step up to the plate and be supportive when they are shown a very extreme or obvious example of mental health issues, but when people who deal with it on the day to day in less extreme but still ways that affect our lives it is often just brushed off as laziness, being unfriendly, antisocial or simply that it is not as big of a deal as it feels. I just wish that sometimes individuals would be a little more supportive of those with less intense disorders and issues because the issues are just as real to us. Yes I get more agitative in my anxious state but I do my best to keep it composed but if I don't want to hold a super long conversation with you it just might not be able to happen that day.

And I find that even when you tell people things like, ""oh, sorry I'm just feeling really anxious,"" or ""oh, my anxiety is just really acting up today,"" they tend to just brush it off like ""oh, sorry dude but that doesn't seem that bad."" I understand that this is just largely because if you have never had these issues you truly can't understand what it feels like and I understand that. However, the majority of individuals with mental illness have them play out in these less extreme examples and having people constantly brush them off or not even trying to understand does not help the cause of mental health as a whole.",1

"CMV: [Harry Potter and the Cursed Child] Fans & General Public are right to question the casting of a black actress for the role of Hermione, because she is the ONLY race-shifted character in the play",2694,563,2019-12-10 01:44:51,"When the original Harry Potter and the Cursed Child cast was first announced, there was some uproar, confusion, and defense over the choice of casting a black woman to portray Hermione Granger. There was even a [change my view post](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3xp8j6/cmv_there_is_nothing_wrong_with_casting_a_black/) related to it.

I was totally on the ""this is not a problem"" side of this, for a long time, because I hadn't seen the play. It finally came to San Francisco, so I saw it this weekend. Now that I've seen it, I have changed my mind.

**WHAT THIS ISN'T**

I don't have a problem with race-shifted characters in general. The best musical of the decade, Hamilton, prides itself on casting racially-divervice characters. When I saw Hamilton, George Washington and Alexander Hamilton were black. The Schulyer sisters were Hispanic + Asian + White. Philip Hamilton was central american/puerto rican (hard to tell at a distance, but certainly hispanic). I loved all of it. I think this is excellent. Show the world that it doesn't matter who plays the characters, it's about the story and the music, not what color of hair General LaFayette has.

This is the same for other productions like Les Mis or Phantom or Rent. I've seen asian women play Eponine, black men play Macbeth, and more. I love it, and I encourage it.

**WHY I CARE THIS TIME**

The #1 reason I care is because Hermione was the **only** race-shifted character, from her portrayal in the movies, by Emma Watson. The appearance to the movie characters actually seems to be striking, in *every other case* except Hermione. They deliberately made the other cast members appear as similar as possible to their in-movie portrayals.

Because of this choice, Hermione's actress stands out as strikingly different, and it's jarring. It made me wonder why the choice was made, and almost made her feel a little bit more [token-like](https://wiki.southpark.cc.com/wiki/Token_Black) than I would have liked.

I would have preferred they go against the grain, and cast....an asian Harry Potter actor, or a hispanic Dumbledore. Maybe a black Mcgonagall? Make it clear that race *isn't important* to the story, or *stay true to what you're obviously mimicking*.

**TL:DR**

The casting director for Harry Potter & the Cursed Child should have either:

1. Committed to being race-agnostic, and changed the races/genders of more characters
2. OR stayed true to the movie-portrayals of all characters

Instead, they did both. Stayed as true as possible to the movie portrayals for **every** **character except Hermione**. It becomes too jarring, and the actress stands out more than is fair to her.",1
"CMV: If America really wants illegal immigrants out in order to preserve American jobs and save American tax dollars, America should take measures to reduce demand for illegal workers, rather than fight against the incentives by trying to keep them out.",2699,491,2019-02-22 02:45:15,"Here is an exchange between a friend of mine and myself, which he abandoned :(, in which I outline what I think would be a reasonable alternative strategy to wallbuilding and fix for some of the employment/economic problems of US immigration enforcement. I would like to continue the conversation with you all and invite commentary about the potential pitfalls of my design (as I do not believe it is at all the overall best solution to the immigration/employment problem, merely a system that could potentially work given the aims outlined in my title, in a vacuum), as well as direct opposition on the basis of a wall or different priorities being somehow better than this approach.  My assumption is that a physical barrier isn't effective at keeping people out, if there is sufficient incentive for them to get in. I realize my friend's argument isn't the most cohesive so I am really only including it for context on the premise. Thanks for reading.

Friend:    


Have you ever worked with anyone that shouldn’t be in America? I’ll tell you a story about a guy named Luis. He can claim tax exempt. Has free healthcare. Gets EBT, I know because this is how he bought lunch one day. \[Il\]legitimately taking a job of an unemployed legal American. Working in the construction field for over 10 years has opened my eyes to the fact that no ones cares they are here they just want everything to be fair. Same healthcare opportunities, same taxes, same pay. But what I have seen is that contractors get what they pay for. Sloppy work and constant call backs. But in reference to the wall. Why does one build a fence? Is it to keep the nonsense out or keep the dog in? I say get rid of the what if’s about the wall. Build it first to keep the President's promise. I believe he was asking for a little more than 2 billion for it out of a budget in the trillions. Best case scenario is we just put people to work. Essentially giving the money back to the people. Build it. Kill the argument.

My response:    


My counter-proposal to your anti-immigrant sentiment is to hold the unpatriotic employers of illegal workers accountable for their illegal employment practices. If there is genuinely an American ready and willing to take a job currently being held by someone without documents, the employer of that illegal worker is culpable for cutting his fellow American out of the workforce. The employer should pay the taxes, and the benefits, and the healthcare for every illegal employee that can be proven on their payroll- as they would typically with any other employee- and pay the equivalent of a median unemployment salary for the American he has disenfranchised, and pay fines on top of it to fund enforcement of the law. That would fix every complaint \^ you have about Luis except his shoddy workmanship...  It would remove the incentive for employers to utilize illegal labor through strict penalties. It would shift the tax burden from everyone to just the law breakers. If employers stopped employing illegal labor, it would reduce demand and not as many people would come here. Once all that deterrent is in place, we just need to enforce everything better. Perhaps you are asking why I would prefer to punish the American businesses and not punish the immigrants? The answer to that is that the immigrants mostly have no power and nothing to take away. If an immigrant comes here and works illegally, they only have their wages. If we take the job away from them, they can't pay fines, or taxes. Jailing and deporting them costs us money, not them. It's better to remove the incentive for them to be here, and have them go away on their own, or follow the proper channels (revise the VISA program, but maintain the onus of tracking on employers?) and get in legally. If you really want to solve this problem, that's the way you do it. As long as there is demand, and incentive for people to come here illegally, and for employers to employ them illegally without sufficient deterrent, people are going to find a way.",1
CMV: Telling other people to smile is annoying if not rude,2697,264,2019-07-20 00:15:15,"While I agree that smiling is beautiful and inviting, the act of telling someone to modify their facial expressions is rude.  I am a man and get told to smile often by women.  I eventually told a coworker that I didn't have a problem with smiling, but I advised her that it should be my choice.  Was this response appropriate?

When I am told this by someone I already dislike, I respond by saying, ""I only smile at people I like.""  If it’s a stranger, I might say, “No, thank you.”  I have every right to have a resting bitch face or a fart mouth if I want.  Maybe complimenting someone or otherwise making them *feel better* is more appropriate.

The funny thing is I actually smile more frequently now than I used to.  I suffered from severe depression, anxiety, mood swings, and alcohol abuse for many years before seeking help.  I smile much more often now because I feel better.  But I can guarantee that when I had those issues, being commanded to *smile* never made me feel any better.

*Update:* I don't know if I came off like a dick in the above post, so I'd like advice on how to respond to this type of interaction.  I agree with one commenter that my interpretation as to the motive behind the request (e.g., is it for my wellbeing or their comfort) plays a factor.

"CMV: all citizens, regardless of socioeconomic status, should have the same quality of legal representation in civil and criminal litigation.",2687,180,2019-04-25 11:11:05,"It goes without saying that, at least in the United States, having more money means having access to better legal representation in criminal and civil court. Although I do not know of any systematic studies that establish a correlation between the amount spent on legal services with the probability of a favorable outcome, it seems commonsensical and undeniable that there is some discrepancy between the quality of legal representation the wealthiest American receive and that of the poorest Americans.

For some, this state of affairs might seem fine, so long as the poorest Americans have access to  legal representation of some minimal level of quality, in the same way you might think it is okay for the wealthiest Americans to purchase healthcare that his superior to some baseline level of care available to all Americans.

However, there is a crucial distinction between healthcare and legal representation.  To see this, consider the right to vote, for the healthcare model of fairness seems totally inappropraite. It's not that everyone should get some minimum amount of influence (one vote), but that wealthier Americans should be allowed access to more (many votes): rather, we expect everyone's level of influence on elections to be *the same.*

It seems to me that the same should hold of legal representation. Just as everyone should have the same level of influence in a democratic election, everyone should have the same level of influence in a legal proceeding to which they are a party; the probability that someone, say, is convicted for a crime, given a body of evidence, should be the same regardless of who is charged with the crime.

The largest obstacle to realizing this state of affairs is, of course, implementing a fair and effective policy that doesn't end up becoming a bureaucratic nightmare. To ensure that the rich do not have superior legal representation, the government would have to enforce spending caps on legal services proportional to the nature of the tort or crime, in the same way some states set prices on drugs (in addition to providing subsidies to anyone who cannot afford those services). But this question of implementation is independent of the question of justice; it seems obvious to me that the rich should not have access to better legal representation simply because they are rich, even if it is difficult to imagine a workable system in which they do not, in fact, have it.

Another common implementation objection to ""socialized"" law is that it would greatly incentivize frivolous litigation by the poor by removing its cost. And it is probably true that, if the poor could effectively sue anybody for free, we would see a major spike in the overall amount of litigation. But a world in which both the poor and wealthy alike are overly litigious strikes me as far more preferable and just than a world in which only the rich are -- i.e., the current state of affairs. (Another way of putting this is that whatever obstacles a society puts in place to reduce litigation should apply to the rich and poor alike.)

&#x200B;

EDIT: A common response has been to point out that, if quality of legal representation isn't determined by wealth, there will still be inequalities between people's legal representation, due to the unavoidable differences in lawyer quality. I don't see this as inconsistent with my point -- in an ideal world, all lawyers would have the same skill level -- but in the absence of ideal conditions, the fairest distribution of good and bad lawyers would be random, or in proportion to the nature of the case, rather than by income.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: Thanks for the replies, everyone! I didn't expect to receive so many thoughtful and informed responses, and I really enjoyed the discussion. (My first post here, couldn't have enjoyed it more.) My view about the ""fairness"" question remains unchanged, but I have been given more reasons to be skeptical about the possibility of a workable implementation. The most persuasive consideration was probably that the wealthy, under the proposed system, would inevitably advert to outside legal council,  effectively reintroducing the inequality at a different level of legal ""representation.""",1
"CMV: In the next couple of years Amazon will buy Valve, buy Steam from Valve, or make their own software to become the primary PC game distributor.",2685,399,2018-10-08 05:50:05,"Amazon is rich as fuck and it won't be long until they're the largest retailer in the world. (They're currently 3rd behind Walmart and CVS.) Their purchase of whole foods shows they're interested in expanding into new markets.

They're also not ignorant to the world of gaming, having purchased Twitch in 2014. You can find lots of complaints online about operations/administration at Twitch but they have undoubtedly expanded its audience in the last 4 years, and I think the Amazon higher ups view it as a financial success.

I think they see that there's more money to be made in the industry, and being a game distributor fits right in with their existing business model. I think the game distributor business matches their style more than trying to make their own games. It certainly seems like a more...reliable way to make money. Making games is financially risky. (But it could also be super rewarding: see PUBG and Fortnite).

Nobody really knows, but googling shows that Valve is maybe worth about $5bil. That's not an unreasonable purchase price for Amazon, having previously spent ~$1bil for twitch, and ~$14bil for Whole Foods.

If they wanted to make their own software, they could easily sell every game at 50% discount for a year, just eating the cost while they corner the market. But at that point why not just buy Steam?

You can also find a few reports online from various ex-employees that describe Valve as kind of...stagnant. They say it's lost the innovation and motivation it used to have. Some even point to Gabe Newell specifically and say he's no longer motivated, and spends most of his days just playing dota. This implies that he could be receptive to buyout offers.",1
CMV: All Free to Play games with micro-transactions should have the ESRB M Rating.,2684,151,2020-03-18 14:50:25,"To condense my argument for this position, here are some highlights of what supports such an argument:

- [Children this decade have the most access to technologies that were completely inaccessible to similarly aged children last decade.](https://www.childtrends.org/indicators/home-computer-access)

- Free to Play games use Skinner-box psychological exploits to garner money from people who have an addictive personality (e.g., Whales) and children via. the means of pester power (which is outlawed in countries under the EU).

- A lot of mobile Free to Play games use cartoon series to appeal to children, which fall in line with the previous reason and exploiting pester power to gain money from parents.

- Most YouTubers with younger audiences are beginning to be sponsored by mobile Free to Play companies.

- The M Rating would deter parents from allowing their child to even play the game, thus giving the strategy of using micro-transactions a very negative stigma in regards to making a profit.

So summing everything up above, the M Rating would be due to the risk of having children develop an addicting personality (e.g., the reason why casinos only allow people 21 years and older to gamble) and would benefit both them and even many others so that these companies would have a reason not to use such a strategy.

So any of you are welcome to try and change my perspective on this issue, and I certainly hope we can have a conversation about this issue. Bear in mind this isn't an argument to ban Free to Play games as a whole, but more having the ESRB crack down and rate these games properly.",1
"CMV: In a capitalist country where competitiveness and meritocracy are really priced, education must be free, or at least esaily accesible for everyone.",2688,474,2017-11-05 21:51:27,"I'm ideologically centre, at least in my country (I suppose I would look like a fucking commie in the states), and support some socialist policies I find necessary for the correct functioning of a country, even a capitalist one. While I understand, even if I don't share, the arguments against a lot of these policies, like universal, public healthcare, publicly founded science and investigation, or pensions, I can't understand why some people argue against public education from basic school to university. 

In my opinion, for there to be real competition, everyone must have the same starting posibilities, and this is not true if your lack of access to wealth as a child limits your ability to get formed, as you completely depend from your parents. This does not mean that there shouldnt be private schools, after all, if someone can afford them, let 'em, just that everyone should have a right to quality education. 

This continues with universities, where, in a system without public universties, or at least without actually cheap ones, if you dont want to get into very severe debt, you must choose marginally worse universties, which all leads to worse jobs, less options for your children, and the eternal circle will continue.

So, what are some arguments against easily available, cheap and quality public education?

CMV: Religion is a Huge Roadblock to Social Progress,2685,651,2019-04-17 02:01:09,"Okay, hold your downvotes for a second, I’m not just being an edgy atheist here. Please hear me out.

Now I get religion is a part of most people’s lives. I was raised in a religious home, and while I’m now an atheist, it’s not because I was abused in the name of God or something like that. I’ve seen firsthand how kindhearted some religious people can be.

Unfortunately I’ve also seen up close and on the news, how awful people can be in the name of a deity. The rampant discrimination and abuse against the LGBT community makes me sick, and hopefully it makes all of you sick as well. Where is most of that hatred rooted? Religion’s so-called “Holy books”. The Bible, the Torah, and the Qur’an all have anti-homosexual messages stated at some point. Of course not all Christians or Muslims or Jews are homophobic. I know many, including my parents and most of my extended family, who accept LGBT people, and that’s great. However, they’re technically going against their holy books.

Not to mention that religion strengthens the sexist structure of society. Catholics only believe men are capable of being priests; Muslim women, especially in the Middle East, are subjugated by men and in my opinion, the hijab is sexist and meant to make women “property of their husbands”. 

Religion also makes many normal things taboo and sinful, often resulting in shame and guilt. Aside from the obvious homosexuality, transgenderism, and the like, masturbation, premarital sex, fetishes, and even cohabitation are presented as sins, when in reality, they’re perfectly natural parts of life that people should shamelessly be able to enjoy.

And don’t get me started on the various extremist groups such as the Westboro Baptist Church and ISIS.

I get that people who are going through a tough time can find solace in religion, however I feel that solace is misguided and a result of lies. I just can’t see past the negatives in this situation. 

Sorry if I’ve offended anyone. None of this is personal, and I get I’m generalizing a large group of people. I look forward to hearing your responses.",1
"CMV: Convincing ""ugly"" people to think they are not ugly is more harmful than accepting their ugliness.",2688,305,2018-12-16 21:50:20,"Ugly people should be taught to love themselves because being ugly is OK, not because everyone is beautiful. Convincing unattractive, below average people that they are pretty is doing more harm to them. It empowers the idea that ""beautiful is good, ugly is bad"" and ""you have to be beautiful to be loved"". It makes ugly people to have unrealistic hopes which can make them delusional or depressed. 

There are lots of downsides to this. They might want attractive partners and keep getting rejected and get frustrated. They will get crushed when they find out other people actually thought they are unattractive. They can no longer trust other people and it will be a lot harder for them to get over it as they aren't prepared how to love themselves being ugly. They might get obsessed with their looks and care too much about how other people perceive them because some people will tell them they are unattractive and some people will be nice and tell them they are beautiful. This kind of different opinions make them overthink and do mental gymnastics and have unrealistic hopes, the very harmful and toxic ""maybe..."" 

It's like telling short people they are tall. No, they are not. That's just a lie that will make short people's lives so much harder. It makes people keep thinking ""How tall is tall? Am I tall enough? Am I tall enough to this person? Am I short in this country but tall in that country?""  We should tell them they are short and it's just fine, just like how we should tell the average people they are average and ugly people they are ugly. That's not being an asshole. You can say it in the nicest way.

An ugly person should be able to stop caring about their appearance. ""My appearance isn't my strength so I should work on something else."" is a very healthy mindset. If they want to work on their appearance, that's very healthy too. To think that they are average when they are indeed below average and they can be above average by doing this and that, is not.

Of course beautify is subjective. It's fine to say they are attractive if you think so, even though they aren't conventionally attractive. I believe beauty comes in all shapes and sizes, but so is ugly. A skinny person can be ugly, a blonde can be ugly, a 22 year old can be ugly. There are a lot of people that sugarcoat too much and simply lie. This is extremely harmful to all of the less than drop dead gorgeous people.",1
CMV: Pride parades should have less NSFW content,2685,752,2018-06-05 13:42:47,"To preface, I'm bisexual and I love pride month and pride parades. However, I think that the amount of inappropriate content impedes some of the intent behind pride. 

To me, pride is about celebrating the LGBT+ community and promoting acceptance and understanding. It's about not being ashamed of who we love and what we identify as, and being able to share that with the world. 

I think the parade would ideally be a great place to bring our families, to show parents and children how incredible and talented the community is. I'm not out to my family, but bringing them to Pride would be a great start towards warming them up to accept me. But generally given the amount of public nudity and sexual inappropriateness at Pride, this is pretty much out of the question. 

In order to be more inclusive and celebrate love with as many people as possible, I think pride parades should tone down the sexual undertones and focus more on the concepts of love, pride, celebration, and acceptance. ",1
CMV: A unified Earth flag (instead of a country's flag) must be used when humans first land on Mars (and thereafter),2684,323,2018-08-10 20:41:14,"Now I don't have a problem with the Americans planting their flags when they landed on the moon. It was during the peak of the space race and it was essentially USA vs Russia so I get that. I also do not mind what flag would be used in this scenario. I personally do quite like the most well known Earth flag (shown [here](http://www.flagofplanetearth.com/#intro-shift)) however there are some other good designs (such as [this](https://www.deviantart.com/lordnarunh/art/United-Earth-flag-2-535271602) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/vexillology/comments/69f028/a_cross_over_between_uhellericks_and_oskar/)). To me, its not the flag design that I was debated, its the concept of using a flag to represent earth going forward.

Here are the reasons I believe we should use a United Earth flag going forward:

1) In a time where wars and conflict are decreasing, and the world is coming together in many ways, having a flag to represent the planet would be a fantastic idea. What better way to push this idea than to have the entire planet broadcast itself to the universe under one flag.
2) Instead of people believing that, for example, only the USA made it to Mars, we would show how the human race made it to Mars. Everyone in the world would be linked to moments such as these, not just countries (As a Brit, I don't feel connected to the Apollo moon landing, like Americans would. If the flag was that of earth, my feelings would be much different)
3) It would cost virtually nothing for space companies to change from using a country's flag to the unified flag. 
4) It symbolises a United Earth, not just a specific country. People from the future would look back at these great moments of space triumph and see how the Earth is completely capable of coming together.

Now I understand that after time, any flag that is planted on Mars would fade into a plain white. However, that is not the main reason I think we should advertise as Earth and not as individual countries. To me, its not just about planting the flag representing Earth (while that would be an amazing symbolic moment when it happens), its about the Earth/human race, venturing out into space, as one. 

I've struggled to find counter-arguments for this idea, so I'd like to hear if anyone has any. I'm gonna do my very best to reply to everyone,  however, if you comment with points I've already replied to, I'm not gonna reply to them individually.

"CMV: Win or lose, Donald Trump has drastically altered American political culture for the worse, and opened the door to all kinds of batshit insanity in the future",2673,658,2016-09-26 20:31:13,"Let me just say now that this is not a thread to discuss whether or Donald Trump ought to be president; my view is that he's a national embarrassment, the worst mainstream presidential candidate in US history, and utterly unqualified to hold any public office, and I'm not likely to change that view any time soon. What I want to discuss is the extremely unusual and alarming nature of this election cycle, and what it means for the future of America and the world.

The tl;dr is this: **Donald Trump has essentially changed the rules of American political culture in such a way that he's completely erased any standards of decency, honesty or credibility from the electoral process.** Things that would have ended political careers before this election cycle have now become so normal with Trump that no one even cares. And that bodes very, very poorly for the future.

While [this](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/things-donald-trump-has-said-and-done-that-in-a-normal-election-would-disqualify-a-nominee/) source is obviously biased, it aggregates, using external sources, the evidence for the point I'm making, and which we all understand already: Donald Trump has said and done a lot of insane, deplorable shit and somehow still has a very real shot at becoming president. What the hell is going on here? Remember just four years ago, when Mitt Romney's ""takers"" blunder nearly sank his campaign, and almost certainly contributed to his defeat at the polls? Remember when a single gaffe like that was nearly fatal to a presidential candidate? What the fuck has happened over the past four years? And what's going to happen in the future? As we near the debates, which are all but guaranteed to be a shitshow unlike anything we've seen before, I can't help but wonder.

Even if Trump loses, I worry about the next lunatic, and the next one. Trump has paved the way for more candidates as bad or worse than him, and if he can come this close to winning now, it seems to me like it's only a matter of time before someone of his ilk gets elected. Thanks to Trump, and his supporters, we've entered a bizarre alternate dimension where candidates can lie about basically anything, and no matter how fucking crazy or bigoted they get, it means nothing at all to their supporters. Feelings have completely ""trumped"" facts and logic for a huge portion of the voting demographic. This anti-intellectual undercurrent has been strong in American politics since forever, but I never thought it could get this bad. Nor did many others. We were wrong. And now I'm legitimately worried about the future.

**EDIT: This is not a thread about Hillary Clinton either; she is dishonest but in no way remarkable in that regard. She's far more qualified, and certainly doesn't lie as shamelessly as Trump, or pander to xenophobia nearly as much. This is part of my view that you're not going to change. So if you're going to try to derail the thread, kindly move along.**

**EDIT EDIT: For those disappointed that I awarded a delta, the rules say to award one if someone changes your view ""in some way."" The poster in question did convince me that I may be overstating the problem, and that the future may not be as dim as I made it out to be. But I nevertheless still hold the concerns outlined in the OP.**",1
"CMV: There is nothing wrong with addressing a group of people with ""Hey guys!""",2667,715,2019-06-27 04:21:08,"I've had a discussion with a friend who mentioned they don't like me using the word ""guys"" as a neutral way of addressing a group of people that includes multiple genders.

To me, ""guys"" is a stand-in for the gender-neutral ""peeps""/""people"" etc. And that's how I use it. 
I even address a group solely consisting of women with ""Hey guys"". It doesn't hold any gendered meaning, implication about identify or orientation.

I really want to understand the issue with this, as my friend wasn't able to explain it to me in a way that totally made sense/could convince me.

So please give it your best and CMV!
Thanks, guys! Erm sorry... Thanks everyone!

Edit: I feel like I didn't make the intention of my friend clear. Not sure if that changes anything in the discussion, but just for my own peace of mind: The issue wasn't that he asked me to not address him with the term ""hey guys"".

CMV: Amazon is getting way too big/powerful and should be broken up.,2659,577,2019-03-18 14:15:19,"Amazon is expanding into a ridiculous range of markets. Grocery stores. TV. Clothing. Household items. Electronics. The list goes on. Amazon has one of the highest net worth out of nearly any company, with its CEO being the richest man in the U.S. (possibly the world). Given its financial power, Amazon is able to expand into a market rapidly, even by buying out  a major current competitor (Whole Foods comes to mind).

The power Amazon has allows it to potentially ruin any competition if it so desires. This would be bad for the consumer, as it would like lead to higher prices and stifle innovation/item quality. And since Amazon has control over so many markets, it risks being a centralized source of many of our necessities.

Many internet companies, such as Netflix and Comcast, use Amazon's cloud platform to operate. This gives Amazon even more power over its competition. The only viable competitor is Microsoft's Azure, but even that is fairly weak in comparison to AWS (Amazon's cloud-computing platform).

On top of all of this, Amazon has a bad track record with treating its employees well. This makes the issue a humanitarian one as well as an economic one.

But hey, I could be totally wrong here. So please, CMV!

CMV: Digging up Mummies and displaying them in museums in barbaric and disrespectful,2648,391,2020-01-21 23:45:34,"I am a lover of history and museums, but this one I just really don't understand.

This post was mostly inspired by this video, [Exhibit 1](https://www.facebook.com/ModCn/videos/864799580335172/), that one of my extremely conservative friends shared on Facebook.

Facebook has censored the video, but there's no blood, gore, or otherwise graphic content. The video shows an innocent young-ish woman and her son being hunted down and savagely beaten by a black girl, while a crowd of other black teens watches, films, and encourages her.

**NOTE:** I don't follow the page that originally posted it and have no interest in discussing other things this page has posted, as they're totally irrelevant.

This isn't an isolated kind of thing. If you look hard enough, you can find videos just like this all over the internet.

Most critically, **as I see it this is not a race issue.** It's an issue of a culture that exists predominantly in low-income black-majority areas, but it's not unique to black people nor does it affect all of them. You'll notice that two of the perpetrators in exhibit 4 are white, along with possibly others in exhibits 6-176.

Poverty in these areas is certainly an exacerbating factor, but I don't believe it is the sole cause. Poverty-driven crime is that in which the criminal is trying to gain something; selling drugs, theft, etc. This crime is simply belligerent. The perpetrators are gaining nothing from it aside from satisfaction. Moreover, I have personally witnessed this ""thug life"" culture in extremely affluent areas, being adopted by the children of very well-off families (though again, not all or even most of them).

_____

As I said, this is a problem of culture. Portions of it may be due to anti-intellectualism, neglect of family, general lack of care for others, lack of ambition or motivation to improve one's life, lack of respect for the law, lack of self-restraint, or more. I'm not even going to try to explain the depth of it, because I don't know it. Nor do I know how it could could even begin to be repaired. And I realize that the culture is neither exclusive nor universal to black people, but I can't think of a better term for this culture. It seems to go beyond just ""thug life.""

But right now **nobody will even talk about this,** because to do so will instantly have you be branded a racist. I fully expect an inbox full of replies and messages calling me a nazi, a racist, a white supremacist, and more (which is why I'm using a throwaway account). I assure you I'm none of the above, though of course that won't convince you.

**Clarification:** ""Nobody"" means nobody in mainstream news and discussion circles. Obviously there are small corners of the internet (including this one) where this does get discussed, but not in any impactful way.

There is a critical failure in this culture that contributes heavily to the continued poverty and misery of these areas. If we keep dancing around it in the interest of race sensitivity, it will never be fixed and people will continue to suffer.

CMV: It should be illegal to put flyers on people's cars,2642,594,2018-09-25 18:46:05,"I realize this is illegal in some places, but it should be illegal everywhere.

Putting flyers in people's car windows or in their windshield wipers is basically littering. The owners of the cars never consented to having pieces of paper be left on their property. If you want to advertise your business using flyers, have people hand them out to people. Don't just leave it on their car. Will that be more expensive paying someone by the hour to hand people flyers? Yes. But that's the business owner's problem. An attempt at cheap advertisement does not justify putting shit on people's cars.

CMV: Some forms of feminism won't help in achieving gender equality,2638,578,2020-09-12 14:48:33,"I'm writing this as a woman and someone who has seen lots of post about feminism. For the record, I do want gender equality. I believe that women should be treated with respect and they should be treated equally as men. The problem I have with some feminists is that they want respect and be empowering but then they start to bash men. 

 I have often seen people who post comments on social media praising women empowerment but then they start calling men ""pigs"" and other names which sparks negative responses from some people and praise from others. I think there should be a way to convey the message of feminism without causing men, as a whole, to be completely the bad guy. I know there are some men who can be really sexist but I also know lots of men who aren't like that. 

From my experiences, it's hard to have a respectful and honest conversation with someone if they were to insult your gender or ethnicity or any part of your identity. It's also hard to make someone listen if you start off in that same way. 

I do acknowledge sexism has come from a dark history of abuses on women which, yes, they do come from men. But I just want to say that not all men are like that, and saying ""all men are scum"" or something close is a hasty generalization and won't completely help in the goal of gender equality.

Shaming any gender, male or female, is never good. It belittles the other side and downplays any struggles they face. Women should be able to do things men can do, and men should not be looked down on due to ""weaknesses"" such as their mental health.

We shouldn't aim to empower a single gender to the point where they can belittle the other side, and still be in the right. That was what led to sexism in the past that we're facing now. We should aim for equality. No gender should be looked down upon in any situation.

CMV: Having sex with someone while knowingly having a transmissible STI and not telling your partner should be rape.,2639,344,2019-08-01 07:16:08,"Today on the front page, there was a post about Florida Man getting 10 years for transmitting an STI knowingly. In the discussion for this, there was a comment that mentioned a californian bill by the name of SB 239, which [lowered the sentence for knowingly transmitting HIV](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/new-california-law-reduces-penalty-knowingly-exposing-someone-hiv-n809416). I don't understand why this is okay - if you're positive, why not have a conversation? It is your responsibility throughout sex to make sure that there is informed consent, and by not letting them know that they are HIV+ I can't understand how there is any. Obviously, there's measures that can be taken, such as always wearing condoms, and/or engaging in [pre or post exposure prophylaxis](https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/hiv-prevention/using-hiv-medication-to-reduce-risk/post-exposure-prophylaxis) to minimise the risks of spreading the disease, and consent can then be taken - but yet, there's multiple groups I support who championed the bill - e.g. the ACLU, LGBTQ support groups, etc. So what am I missing?

**EDIT:** I seem to have just gotten into a debate about the terminology rape vs sexual assault vs whatever. This isn't what I care about. I'm more concerned as to why reducing the sentence for this is seen as a positive thing and why it oppresses minorities to force STIs to be revealed before sexual contact.",1
CMV: I think it is shameful that every modern nation has national vacation polices except for America.,2626,596,2017-08-03 21:38:42,"I think that it is shameful that Americans don’t get more time off from work. It seems that most of our lives revolve meaningless work, at times, just for the sake of work. I think it would be more appropriate to value your workers more and emulate countries like Italy, France, and New Zealand whom provide mandatory time of for its citizens. 
I have a co-worker who just had a kid and can’t afford to be home with her. My company’s PTO policy is 2 weeks per fiscal year, and she has met this from being sick. This has caused a lot of people around the office to fall ill and use their PTO time for sickness. I know this isn’t very relevant to vacation, but still, it is like we are work martyrs.  Personally, I feel that free time leads to reflection and growth. This contributes to an overall better sense of well-being and happiness, and I don’t think we are doing much to encourage that in our society. 40+ hours a week, 50+ weeks a year for 40+ years just doesn’t seem fair. 
I think we should provide our citizens with a base-line of minimum time off from work. I think that this will be great for several aliments of our society. Think about it? How many of us truly like work? It is an necessary evil. Roughly 70% of Americans are unsatisfied with their work and we spend most of our time goes there. I am open to fair debate and education on this topic. Thanks, Reddit!

CMV: It should be illegal for banks/cards to charge a surcharge for checking your balance at an ATM,2627,332,2019-03-26 23:19:21,"I work with the homeless in my spare time, and most of them are obviously in dire financial situations. Many of them can't normal bank accounts because of this, so they're often forced to use ""pre-paid"" reloadable debit cards for what limited funds they might acquire. Often, these are predatory business models that are designed to take as much money from the poor as possible. One of the most grievous examples is charging a surcharge to check a balance at an ATM. These people often don't have access to cell phones or computers to do an online inquiry of their balance so they're forced to check it periodically at an ATM, which incurs a charge. I'm not talking about a charge implemented by whomever owns the ATM, I rarely see that anymore. I'm talking about the charge coming straight from the bank/card to check funds in an ""account"" in which they're already using your funds anyways. I just don't see a justifiable business decision to do so other than taking advantage of people in poverty.

**Edit**: There seems to be a common misunderstanding of what I'm referring to here, my apologies for not making that clear in my original write up. I am ***not*** referring to the owner of the ATM charging fees for use of the ATM.  What I'm referring to is when your own bank charges a *separate* fee outside of the ATM owner. For example, when you use an ATM you'll often get a notification that goes something like this: ""The owner of this ATM charges a 2.50 transaction fee ***in addition to the fees applied by your own financial institution***. The bolded italic is specifically what I'm referring to here.",1
"CMV: If god is omnipotent and omniscient and creator of everything, it would have to be incredibly cruel.",2625,1729,2019-09-04 15:08:27,"Omnipotent would mean it can do anything in the system it created. Omniscient would have to mean it can completely predict anything that happens in the system it created. Created everything means it created every system there is. 

Combine these two, then the sufferings in the world have to be permitted  in some way by god, even if you call it not intervening. Because it will be able to predict the sufferings beforehand based on the kind of system it's creating. After that, not doing anything while being able to do is cruel. To make matters worse, If god created everything, every kind of suffering there is, the possibility of them would also have to be created by it and that potential seen beforehand.



Edit (10 hours after posting): A lot of people commented and still commenting. A lot of them are pretty elaborate. Considering my routine at the moment, it would take considerable time for me to get through all of them. Please leave your comments, the notifications are coming. If the thread isn’t closed by admins, i will go through everything, whatever the time it takes.

Thank you.

Up until now, the responses i've seen can be summarized into this -

Whatever sufferings we ""perceive"", is needed by this creator figure for it's goal, a goal none of us has the ability to comprehend but is likely moral.

My response - We are talking about an omnipotent, omniscient being that created everything about reality. A reality we (every life) experience. A lot of sufferings are part of this experience. Whether they are only from our perspective, a creator that created everything in reality, including our mind, would still predict and design what this sufferings are and what they feel like or at least things that make them possible. So, whether there's an ultimate reason or the nature of sufferings is subjective, the sufferings and the way It's felt by life is still there and is the result of a being, that would have to be the prime example of free will, acting the way it wants. Want, not need. So, criticism like this is still valid. 
An analogy - You create some beings, in what is a fully controlled and predictable environment to you. These beings experience something similar to sufferings. End justifies the means doesn’t make you choosing to start this (not needing) and allowing, even if subjective ailments, not cruel. For the fact that your hand wasn’t forced and the sufferings of your subjects, had to be knowingly signed of by you.",1
CMV: Race based Affirmative Action should be abolished/replaced with Socioeconomic based Affirmative Action,2624,434,2019-07-27 16:46:01,"I believe that **race based Affirmative Action in college admissions should be abolished or replaced with Socioeconomic Affirmative Action** for the reasons listed below. Different topics will be listed by alphabetical letters, and different contentions by numbers for the ease of reference. I will abbreviate Affirmative Action to **AA**, and UnderRepresented Minority to **URM.** All of my underscored texts are direct quotes from the linked source.

A bit on my background, I am around 75% Pacific Islander and 25% East Asian. I spent most of my 1-12 education at an East Asian country, I will refer to it as **country X**. I have a dual nationality (American/country X). I have been to 8 different schools from elementary to my current stage, and I am now a college freshman.

(Not relevant to given topic) For reference, I do not support legacy admissions/donor advantage, and I support athlete recruits (I see it as merit based, a mastery of physical education if you will).

A **Social Mobility**

1. **I believe race based AA does not provide the social mobility some claim**. I have seen people argue that URMs are on average on the lower end of the social class, and race based AA would make the situation better. Now let's take 4 hypothetical students. A rich white student, a rich black student, a poor white student, and a poor black student. [Now let's assume wealth is correlated to academic performance, and the rich black student performs similar to the poor white student.](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Mean-SAT-Mathematics-and-Verbal-Scores-by-Family-Income-for-the-2003-College-Bound_tbl2_280232788) Harvard can take in 2 students. So who get's in? Most likely the richer white and black students, as the rich white kid performs the best, and the rich black kid and poor white kid have similar academic performance, but AA breaks the deal. And now if race based AA is replaced with socioeconomic based AA, the deal breaker would turn in favor of the poor white kid, thus **achieving social mobility.** Now magnify the four studetns into 4 groups of 2 different social class and 2 different race. The same situation would apply - elite private schools would still fill up its cohorts with the 2 upper class groups, while the 2 lower class groups remains rejected. This is why race based AA does nothing to aid social mobility.
2. In Harvard (and other elite private schools to a similar extent), [**rich students outnumbering low-income ones, 23 to 1**](https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/10/22/harvard-children-wealthy-families-vastly-outnumber-poor-that-problem/dC8NG2jViPGfgLWaB2wEZO/story.html)**,** quite the opposite of what you would expect for affirmative action isn't it? This is inherently a statistical backing to 1., which shows that **most URMs in elite private schools would still be rich** anyhow.
3. **Most importantly, combating social immobility cannot be done by giving a easier pass to college.** The poor black kid from 1. and the vast majority of those who are genuinely disadvantaged will never make it to the doors of elite colleges no matter what. Better education **starts from elementary, middle school, and high school** \- reform the trashy public schools where a handful of people get pregnant every year/a big portion of the class are under drug abuse, etc. Social mobility will not happen when **AA benefits the wealthiest and resourceful of each race.** Renowned Berkeley philosophy professor John Searle believed that race based AA was a disaster. [“There was a huge dropout rate of affirmative-action admits in my classes by midterms,” Searle added. “No one had taught them the need to go to class. So we started introducing BS majors, **in an effort to make the university ready for them, rather than making them ready for the university**.”](https://nypost.com/2018/09/01/california-passed-an-anti-affirmative-action-law-and-colleges-ignored-it/)
4. [UC Berkeley tried to **give an admissions preference to low-income students. This device backfired, however, when it yielded a wealth of Eastern European and Vietnamese admits** — not the kind of “diversity” that the university had in mind. So the campuses cut their new socioeconomic preferences in half and went back to the drawing board.](https://nypost.com/2018/09/01/california-passed-an-anti-affirmative-action-law-and-colleges-ignored-it/)
5. Just to bring in some name clout, [Martin Luther King jr. argued, that a Bill of Rights for the Disadvantaged would disproportionately benefit black people who “form the vast majority of America’s disadvantaged”. At the same time, it was appropriate for poor whites to benefit, King said, because they suffer deprivation, if not racial discrimination. “It is a simple matter of justice that America, in dealing creatively with the task of raising the Negro from backwardness, should also be rescuing a large stratum of the forgotten white poor,” he wrote.](https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/09/04/affirmative-action-should-be-based-on-class-not-race)

B **Campus Diversity**

1. **Categorizing asians, whites, blacks, latinos respectively into one single racial/continent sized group is a completely foolish and lazy way of classification.** Let's take the asian category. It consists of Indians, Pakistanis, Chinese, Japanese, Malays, Koreans, Indonesians, Taiwanese, Vietnamese, Laotians, Bangladeshis, Singaporeans (a mix of its own), HK Chinese, filipinos, etc. Each of them with vastly different ethnicity, anthropology, history, and sometimes even skin color of their own. Countries like vietnam, Hong Kong, philipines, India, etc. were all colonized at some point and might have more similarity to their European colonizers than their neighbors. Quite ironic that the best anthropologists and historians come from the same institution that failed to realize such basic fact innit?
2. Building on 1., **Race != ethnicity**. If you're looking for diversity, ethnicity is **closer** to actual behavioural/cultural diversity than race. [**Race** refers to a person's physical characteristics, such as bone structure and skin, hair, or eye color. **Ethnicity**, however, refers to cultural factors, including nationality, regional culture, ancestry, and language.](https://www.diffen.com/difference/Ethnicity_vs_Race)
3. Building on 2., **Identity != ethnicity.** In essence, your identity is what makes you unique from others. Your identity is probably the **single** most significant factor (you're welcome to change my mind). But at the same time, identity incorporates **social class/environment, ethnicity/culture, religion, etc.** **Your skin colour is a subset of a subset of your identity**, and classifying diversity based on race is just, again, laziness.
4. As I explained in the intro, I have been to 8 schools in 3 continents from elementary to now as a college freshman. Most of them were in country X, where I attended 2 local schools, 2 privates schools, and a private american school which is the most expensive one in country X. While anecdotal, my observation from my experience with all these different classmates was that **No matter which continent I was in, those who are richer and poorer behave similar to their own social class respectively, regardless of their race.** My local school mates consisted of mostly lower and middle class, and they tend spent money very, very sparingly, the spending culture of my private school mates was completely opposite. They could afford to go clubbing every weekend, some even started at 16 or 17 with fake IDs, while my local school mates never clubbed. My private school mates were into netflix, kendrick lamar, giannis antetokounmpo, etc. while my local school mates were into baseball, local celebrities, local/korean tv shows, anime, etc. My private school mates take 130USD per hour tutors/5 student cram classes, while my public school mates study on their own/attend lecture style 200 student per class cram schools. In europe private school, my school mates acted very similar to the rich school mates back in country X. My point is, **behavioural culture of the same social class weighs more than that of the same race.**
5. UCs/Caltech do not perform race based AA, yet I have never heard anything negative about their campus life with regards to diversity (besides caltech being quirky due to its STEM only environment). **Berkeley is especially notable for being one of the most progressive institutions in the world and a diverse ideological pioneer of society**. Why is it a ""problem""for schools performing AA?

C **Racism**

1. I've seen arguments about how racist bullies prevent URMs from excelling academics. However the US today is definitely progressed enough for everyone to frown upon racists, and hard core KKK style racists are generally widely condemned. As for **subtle racism**, it **happens to all races**, to blacks, latinos, arabs (counted as white in college apps), asians (r/asianmasculinity), and even whites (dumb blonde jokes). Stereotypes exists for everyone. And from my experiences with tons of URMs and being a minority in country X, racism is a taboo, no matter how much of a pillock someone is. Also **it is impossible to quantify racism**, so an admission guideline based on it would be too incompetent to reflect any realistic situation.
2. **Race based AA stirs more racism**. A chinese friend of mine studied in a public magnate school in florida. He was the valedictorian, class president, president of a few clubs, officer of a student government in his local region, 2nd place in local math competition (not olympiad tho). He got rejected from every T15 he applied to except Upenn (thank god). He has a very passive personality, but from talking to him I can tell that he still holds a slight grudge because a black classmate of his got into his dream skl EA, but still applied to all kinds of T15s on the RD round, and he thinks that he would've had a good chance if the black student stopped applying after getting into his dream school. He also strongly believes that the black kid got in to Uchicago, columbia, stanford, dartmouth, etc. over him because he is black, not because of his merit or have a personality colleges are looking for. I of course believe that it is wrong to place any blame at/undermine the black student, but the **fact is my friend's grudge and opinion about the black student was a combination of his believing that AA played a part** and that there are quotas in his public school (normally only 1 get into HYPSM every year).
3. On the **micro (individual) level, race based AA is indirectly racist towards whites/asians**, since if one worked extremely hard to achieve the academic performance and extracurricular, but still fails to get in knowing that people who are less qualified get in **because of their race**, it is only natural for them to feel imbalanced or even a target of institutionalized racism. I have seen people on reddit claiming that they or their friends mis-chose their race, then their offer got rescinded after contacting colleges.

**tl;dr:** The current race based AA is too incompetent to combat social mobility and institutionalized racism, and diversity is a false axiom.

As you probably can see, I hold a strong opinion on Affirmative Action, and I welcome any different perspective as long as it makes sense.",1
CMV:People who are morbidly obese shouldn't get handicap parking passes or any other handicap benefits.,2620,496,2018-03-01 00:15:57,"Everyday I see morbidly obese (300+lbs) people parking in handicap spaces, and taking advantage of access to handicap benefits. I believe that these people would greatly benefit from having to walk into places they want to go into. Doctors should stop coddling people with weight problems, and promote healthy lifestyle changes, starting with little and easily accomplished tasks. Obesity is an epidemic in this country (USA) and we need to take every possible way to combat it. I am by no way fat shaming anybody, but being overweight can lead to alot more health problems than people actually realize. Letting these people take the easy way out when it comes to traveling or using things actual handicap people need is very disheartening. I wish these people would get help with their problems. I realize there's a medical aspect to it as well, like glandular issues, and thyroid issues. But these are just crutches people with eating disorders use to justify the 4000 calories they take in, in a day. Medicine has come so far, there are possible ways to maintain your weight, they just have to be willing to accept the criticism, and find the will power to overcome whatever is weighing them down (pun not intended).

edit : grammatical errors. 

EDIT: I know this has only been up for a few hours, but thank you everyone for your wonderful, thought out responses. I understand a few new points of view on the subject. For example, my standpoint on the ""at fault"" argument. It is possible that people who are obese, became obese because of an underlying disability or mental ailment causing them to gain weight.  These people I, personally, wouldn't have a problem if they had a Handicap Pass. However, I also do realize for what its worth, I, as an individual, am no way going to change the laws or legislation about Handicap Pass accessibility. Ultimately its up to doctors discretion on who or who does not get a parking pass or any other handicap benefit.

CMV: Not voting for X isnt the same as voting for Y,2613,649,2020-08-05 12:21:59,"Both parties do this by the way, and have been for most elections but this talking point was especially ramped up in the 2016 election and it's starting to rear it's ugly head for the 2020 election. So let me just get this out of the way and tell you I'm not voting for either of the two fucks that representing the major American parties, and my lack of voting for your candidate is not a vote for your opposition.

An analogy: 

You present me with two dishes. On one dish is a heaping pile of shit. On the other dish chunky and rank smelling mound of vomit.

""You're not gonna choose to eat that plate of shit, right?"" you ask.

""God no, I could never eat a plate of shit,"" I respond. You're relieved but that relief soon turns to shock as I continue, ""but I'm not gonna eat that plate of vomit either.""

You're shocked! Baffled! How could I?! ""But, but,"" you say, ""if you don't eat the plate of vomit that's the same as eating the plate of shit! I thought you didnt want to eat the shit? I realize that you're not actually physically consuming the shit, but if you dont eat this vomit it's THE SAME THING AS EATING SHIT!""

Fuck you and your partisan politics. Biden and trump both suck and I'm not gonna pretend one doesn't.

Change my view by convincing me that not voting for X actually IS the same as voting for Y

**EDIT:** I made an emotional post last night after having a small argument with someone after they discovered that I didn't think I was going to vote for Biden. It's a line I've heard before and for whatever reason it struck a particular chord with me this time, maybe because I have more disdain for Trump in the 2020 election than I had for him in the 2016 election, I don't know. I spent awhile last night reading through every comment on this post and really taking in what others were saying and trying to have meaningful discussions with people whether I agreed with their points or not. As the night grew a later some of my replies started shifting from meaningful discussion to emotional ranting and that's not productive to anyone so I just left it alone for the night and sincere apologies if one of my emotional rants were directed at anyone reading this now,

That said, I didn't anticipate waking up to this post being on top of the CMV sub and the flood of comments that have come with it, so there's no chance I'm going to reply to everyone who's commented on this like I had wanted to do,it would start getting redundant anyway if I did. Still, there are some things I want to make clear and answer broadly:

- I'm not a closet Trump supporter. Don't know why this has to be clarified, but I guess it's a pretty common belief that taking issue with our system or not voting for Biden makes me a closet Trumper. Not in my case at least.

- I believe in voting and that voting is important. My view is not a call to stop voting, to be apathetic to politics, or to stop seeking change. It was only a way of saying that the presidential election specifically has a general mindset behind it that I take issue with.

- I have voted on every single political ballot that I have ever qualified to take part in (age, location). I'm lucky to live in Oregon, where we register to vote online and are sent ballots by mail, it's ridiculously easy to vote in this state so I've never had a valid excuse not to vote. I go over every measure proposed in each ballot, not just the presidential cycles, and vote on what I believe is in my and my communities best interests at the state, county, and city levels. If I'm not confidently informed on specific issues, I will abstain from certain measures but I've always submitted at least a partial ballot.

- I don't think I'm going to vote for Biden. I know I'm not going to vote for Trump. Many of those engaging with this post I think would tell me that if I have this mindset, I need to just go ahead and vote for Biden. I don't think I can do that in good faith, but maybe I'll change my mind in the next couple of months. I honestly struggle a lot with the moral issue of supporting with a vote someone who I think serves as a detriment to my country, whatever bit of a country I have right now.

Thank you all for the discussion, and while I'm no longer going to actively reply to comments on this post I will continue to read and genuinely try to digest the conversations this post generates for however long that it does.",1
CMV: It is no longer safe to be a male primary school teacher.,2611,947,2018-09-28 18:29:49,"I'm male. I am a trained and 18 year experienced teacher. I teach in primary school (elementary) and I am the only male teacher in the primary school. I am considering leaving teaching because I no longer feel that it is a safe working environment for a male.

&#x200B;

A quick background about who I am. I need to mention this because it is our current cultural climate is very polarized. I'm proud to say that I come from a nuclear free South Pacific country. I currently live in Germany and see myself as European. I'm a well traveled teacher of young kids, so like most Europeans like me, we are liberal. In other words, to Americans away from the coastal cities, I'm pretty much a fake capitalist who is really a communist.

&#x200B;

I choose to teach young children because I find it the most rewarding job. It isn't like I can't do other jobs. I love (addicted some say) to learning. So, I also have degrees in Geography, Computer Science (programming), 3d movie animation, padi divemaster and on top of that I am a lead designer of fully autonomous drones for a engineering company here in Germany. Most of these skills I can use to make a lot more money than the low pay you get in primary teaching. But I am who I am. My personally suits working with small children. I am the male teacher that children love.  I'm often known as my favourite teacher. In class they say I am strict but yell the least off all the teachers (told that today from my head teacher who interviewed the children). I'm a bit loony, okay loony actor is my style. I teach through positive reinforcement. Ex-students on facebook as teenagers or young adults always request me as friend and often thank me personally.  I'm good at this job and each time my teaching has been officially observed, I have only received excellence (okay once I did get a good). I know males are needed in primary school and it is my civic duty to help the next generations grow into well rounded people.

&#x200B;

But I am afraid. I'm afraid that one allegation against my character will ruin my life. I am aware of this. I have taken training for male teachers on how to keep yourself safe. I am never in a room alone with a child. I will leave the room if the child won't leave. I never walk alone just with one child. I always make sure I do as much as I can to keep myself safe. I am making sure the children no longer can hug me, even though it is what they need and at the same time, a tool teachers use to build a personal rapport with the child. I try and fail still, to leave the emotional parts to the female teachers.

&#x200B;

Over the years I have watch how things have changed. Parents no longer trust teachers as they did only ten years ago (it's got worse). I believe the Brett Kavanaugh hearing in the last 10 days has been my final tipping point. (quick note here, remember I'm Liberal European so Kavanaugh judiciary practice goes against my core personal beliefs). Here  is a man who has worked in public office for over 20 years, is a leader of hiring women in the courts, has documented proof in the forms of in a calendar/diary in who he met and what he did, can get 65 women from his high school days to vouch for him within one day, has written testimony from all those involved saying they have never met (to go along with the calendar), female friend choosing him to discuss their own sexually harassment and along with a lot more facts that can be proven. Yet, in spite of having a clean history with support, he has been accused of being guilty by the media, celebrities, and political leaders all before hearing his side of the story. What's worse, and the thing that is breaking the camels back, is that the ordinary people who share my core beliefs, were the strongest in condemning him and believing her before anything had been said on both sides. Now after the testimony where the facts were heard it is still seen as credible that he did something. She provided no extra facts about that night apart from emotion. Yet when I read most of the media, I see that they still support her.

&#x200B;

This scares me. It scares me so much that I want to leave teaching. I'm not Brett Kavanaugh. I don't have records of my daily activities. I'd struggle to find 5 women from school to sign a letter saying the nice guy I was in high school (I was the geek loony guy ... girls liked the strong sports type more). hell, I've got drunk and past out a few times and yes, I've kissed a lot of girls. I've seen how parents are, I have noticed how the people I am around the most firmly believe her over him even when he presents facts to back up his claim. Is it really worth it? One claim and no matter how I have acted, what proof I have, I have seen from this hearing and many more in the past few years that my life and that of my family will be ruined.

&#x200B;

Today is the start of autumn holidays. I love being a teacher but I am thinking of handing my notice in. Help me change my mind.

edit - please mention if you are male or female. I am hoping it helps me see each gender perspective.

edit 2: thank you all for your comments. I have enjoyed the discussion and it has given me many things to sleep over. I will be back later to comment more but I am a father and being on reddit all day (just as the holidays start) I need to do other things ...yes I have a wife and she is giving me chores. ",1
CMV: A Person Dying Should Not Exempt Them from Negative Opinion,2617,390,2018-06-20 02:58:08,"This view has largely been sparked by the passing of xxxTentacion and has caused much controversy in my area.  The idea that ""speaking ill of the dead"" is wrong and abhorrent seems like an aged and counterproductive concept.  Why should someone, notably those of questionable character and impact, be suddenly free of all criticism simply because they are now dead?  I obviously understand the social implications of speaking ill of, say, someone's deceased son.  However, if that son were a character of questionable morality (criminal, warped views, etc) then perhaps I could see reason in doing so.  This taboo is certainly a sensitive subject but should find no place in constructive dialogue.

I hope I have made my view clear.

Edit:  Many different posts have all found a typical agreement that I can get behind: there should be a period of time, however long it may be, where the dead should be allowed time for family and friends can reflect and the world can reflect on the loss.  I still firmly believe the dead should not be exempt from negative opinion, but having that peace time feels important too.",1
CMV: Games like Chess should not have Male and female division,2609,644,2018-03-20 04:25:46,"There are sports like Football where men have clear advantage over female counterpart with better physical strength. But any sport which does not have clear advantage should not have separation of male and female classes.

Most of the indoor games like chess, pool should have only one tournament where the best person wins. 

What is the history behind every sport having a Women's Championship? Is there a science which shows that men have more intellectual capability to give them edge in chess or any other game which is not physical? What about Archery or shooting? 

Edit: Most of the comments suggest that as there aren't many women who can compete in Open we have separate tournaments for them to encourage them. Does't this suggest that just like in Tennis or other sport, men have advantage and so we have special tournaments for women. Isn't this same as other physical sports? You can't have it both ways. Either men have advantage and having separate tournament is justifiable. Or they don't then we shouldn't have it separate as many other communities are underrepresented. Why shouldn't we have only white or only black or only brown tournaments as one of them underrepresented? ",1
CMV: Simply being religious doesn't make you a good person,2611,444,2019-04-19 20:38:27,"I really don't get the whole religion thing. It makes no sense to me. Not only does religion have a disgusting past, but is also currently doing things that should upset people. I am not just talking about christianity, but that is a big one. I think that Islam gets way too many passes as well. I think that if your arguement is that only God know what is right, you don't have a conscience. If you need an all powerful  being to scare you into doing good, you arent a good person. I say this because I have a lot of Christian friends who think that simply being religious makes you a better person. I really don't get it. How does that work? Even if I were to think that there is a God and that I have to obey him, how does that make you a good person? I understand that having a faith might push you to be charitable and nicer to other people, but as I said before, why can't you do that without religion? If something has to force you to be good, you arent good. I am very curious what the other side to this argument is, as I myself cannot think of anything to counter with at the moment.

My view has been slightly altered. Someone made the point that if you are not good, then your God should not accept you. This is specifically for christianity because it is what I'm most familiar with, but could applied to other religions.

"CMV The Minimum Wage should be based on an economic calculation, not on a fixed dollar amount.",2609,374,2019-09-29 00:40:51,"The Federal minimum wage is $7.25. As the economy moves up and down that number stays fixed. Almost as soon as it is adjusted it begins to be out of date. This could be fixed by having the minimum wage based on an economic calculation. For example it could be a calculation based on covering minimum living standards for shelter, food and transportation. The [Consumer Price Index](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/) could be used to adjust this value for local economies. It would reset every six months or so.

This would take it out of the political arena and make it a truly stable tool to keep the economy functioning.

Why don't I see this as part of the minimum wage conversation? It's always just - should we change it? How much should it be.

I instead believe that criminals should be rehabilitated, an actual, honest effort made into making them a better person, as this is more likely to prevent crimes and especially repeat offenses (this obviously won't help prevent crimes committed out of desperation, but neither will punishment) than punishments made for the purpose of deterring a person from committing a crime (criminals often don't think of the consequences before committing a crime, and many believe they will never get caught). Norway does this and it has a much lower crime rate and repeat offense rate than nations like the USA where criminals are sent to prison. Edit: I would like to include again that I believe that retribution is absolutely morally wrong, regardless of the circumstances, and has no redeemable qualities whatsoever. The point of justice is to prevent suffering, not cause it.",1

And having grown up in Appalachia, I feel like I've become increasingly aware over the last few years of the potential damage that the term inflicts on the perception of lower-class, often white, Appalachian culture. It feels like the casual usage of the term, and its clearly-defined intention is maybe more damaging to white working-class culture than we give it, and diminished some of the very real, very difficult social problems that it implies. It presumes sovereignty over situational hardship and diminishes the institutional issues that need to be dealt with to solve them. Hilary Clinton's whole 'Deplorable' thing a few years back shined a light on the issue and I think there's an inherent relationship between the implied disposability of the people in area from the term white trash itself. Yet, I've never really heard a push to reconsider that term and I don't really understand why. It almost feels too obvious for it not to have happened on the scale it deserves.

CMV: Our current political culture is disturbing. A person's entire worth is decided based on their political opinons. As illustrated by Kanye.,2586,907,2018-09-30 22:21:04,"Gonna try to keep this short. I think Kanye is the perfect example of the current issue in politics.

Kanye is a very talented musician. Of course not everybody will love his music, but he is arguably one of the greatest hip-hop producers of all time and has consistently done pretty good with rapping too. He is a complex individual with a lot of conflicting thoughts and ideas, as well as some mental issues which he has even touched on in his music. 

Yet as soon as he says something about Trump, people absolutely hate him. His entire worth as a person has culminated in his political opinions, apparently. They want to boycott his music, they want him to lose his platform, etc. all because... he likes Trump?

For the record, I am not a fan of Trump at all. In fact, I'll even go as far as saying Kanye is a moron politically. However, I can recognize that he has more qualities beyond his politics. I've even seen many people go as far as saying they won't associate with someone who supports Trump.

I have some great friends who are Trump supporters. We avoid politics because we're going to vehemently disagree on just about everything, but we can recognize that the other has other qualities that outweigh their political opinions. Using politics as a litmus test to see whether or not you'll like a person is absurd and destructive. I think many people with this opinion would surprisingly find a lot in common with people on the other side of the political spectrum. 

Now I don't mean to just be targeting the left here, I'm guessing there might be a similar phenomenon on the right. But since I am on the left and generally consume more left-leaning media my experience is limited with the right's perspective on this issue.

Everyone has more qualities as a person than just their political opinions. Thinking someone is a bad person or not associating with someone exclusively because of politics is absurd and destructive. CMV.",1

Yet when a citizen has to speak to congress, they must  do so under oath and risk committing perjury if they lie.

My solution to this problem is simple.  Anytime an elected or appointed government official is performing their official job duties, they should be considered under oath.  This way if they are caught citing  fake news, conspiracy theories or trying to pump up their base they can be held equally accountable for it.",1

CMV: fixed-amount monetary fines for favor the rich and should instead be based on a percentage of the offenders income or net worth,2581,637,2020-01-15 23:07:12,"Imagine this scenario: the drivers of a Lamborghini and a beaten up 1996 Honda Civic are both parked illegally. The offence carries a fixed fine of $200. 
For the driver of the Lamborghini $200 is pocket change while for the Civic owner, this amount could be the difference between being able to pay rent and homelessness. 
This example could instead be applied to speeding, running a red light or any other offence (traffic or otherwise) that carries a fixed-amount monetary fine and the sentiment of my point is still the same. 

This view was inspired by a reddit comment in which a commenter’s  wealthy friend responded to a reminder that they were parking illegally with words to the effect of “its not illegal, it just costs $200”. Judging by the road behavior I see from drivers of luxury and exotic cars I’d guess that this mindset is widespread among wealthier people. 

My view is that fixed monetary punishments for minor offences disproportionately impact poorer offenders and don’t do much to deter those with the ability to easily pay them.  I propose that a more equitable approach of financial punishments is to base fines on the income or net worth of the offender so that the punishment for a crime carries the same proportional impact on the offender regardless of their socioeconomic status. This would mean that a $200 fine for someone making $20,000 a year would scale so that a person making $10 million a year would pay $100,000 for the same offence. Change my view!",1

A fraction of the people are killed by over dosing, murder or suicide than auto accidents.

Driving school should be mandatory for all new drivers. A driving test should have to be administered with each renewal of a persons drivers license. 

More money should be spent on technology to monitor, track and catch speeding and reckless drivers. 

There should be zero tolerance for any driver operating a vehicle under the influence. Texting and driving should be more than a ticket/citation.

CMV: You should NOT try to win a debate or argument.,2583,178,2019-08-28 06:35:28,"Many people go into debates about politics or whatnot with the intention of ""winning"" the debate. What this usually means is making the opposition change their view on a matter. If you search ""How to win a debate"", you'll find countless articles giving tips and even articles about how to win debate competitions. A debate is seen as a sort of contest by many people.

However, going into a debate with this mindset is inherently close-minded. It means that to concede that the opposition is correct is to admit defeat. The purpose of an argument is to learn from opposing viewpoints and morph your own ideas as new concepts are introduced to you.

If you are so convinced that you are correct that you are going into an argument with the intention of ""winning it"", it defeats the purpose of even debating an issue in the first place. All people should be open to the fact that they may be wrong about certain things.",1
CMV: Libertarians should be as concerned about super rich individuals and Big Corporations as they are about Big Government,2579,669,2017-10-31 13:47:29,"Libertarians are rightfully concerned about Big Government. Big Governments invariably tend to abuse their power. However, the main reason why big governments get abusive is because of the disproportional accumulation of power. And humans absolutely suck at retaining their values and ethics when they get extraordinary levels of power. As such, I find big governments no different at all from megarich individuals or mega corporations. In modern times, they are the ones who actually run the government. They use lobbying and funding to control and push their agendas, to pass highly unethical laws that consolidate and promote their own self interests. They own the politicians.

I only have a basic level understanding of libertarianism but my interpretation of the core philosophy is about ""live and let live"". Give people full autonomy but equally importantly, they should not infringe on your autonomy. Your hand stops at my nose, figuratively speaking.

The big problem is, when megarich individuals as well as megacorporations are left unsupervised, they wield such extraordinary levels of power, that they are literally above the system, above any level of accountability. I feel that libertarians should be as concerned about them as they are about Big Government.

I totally realize and acknowledge the dilemma I am presenting here. However on a practical basis, what I see is more of the abuse of extraordinary power than anything. And it is scary. Hence my view as it stands. Would love to hear your opinion!

CMV: Human labor should inherently be worth a living wage,2575,1117,2019-05-27 14:53:06,"I saw a pretty popular comment on a thread on Reddit earlier today with a lot of comments like “If you don’t like your pay, why don’t you just get a new job?” and “If you’re getting paid less than $15 an hour, it’s because your labor isn’t worth $15 an hour and you should learn new skills to get a better job.” While I obviously understand supply and demand, I think this is an incredibly privileged and ignorant viewpoint. Who would choose to work for $10 an hour when there’s an easy way they could get paid $15 an hour? Those options don’t exist for people caught in poverty. I think having a minimum wage that greater than or equal to a living wage is a moral imperative. 


To me, human labor has inherent value regardless of skill. 40 hours of completely unskilled human labor is still 40 hours of someone’s time and they deserve to be able to afford food and shelter. When slavery was legal, slave owners still gave their slaves food and shelter. Under wage slavery, those things aren’t even necessarily a given. So to me, if your business can’t afford pay a living wage, it shouldn’t be in business. Lots of slave owners were financially screwed after emancipation, but that doesn’t morally justify slavery. So why is it okay for a business owner to say “we can’t afford to pay a living wage.”? 


Then there’s the issue where the government subsidizes the wages of low income employees with EBT and Medicaid. This allows companies to rely on the government to prop their business up while they hoard money and exploit workers. CEOs are essentially siphoning money from the government to pay for new cars and boats and stuff.


Edit: A living wage in no way includes: airpods, yachts, mansions, etc. A living wage just means enough to be able to cover basic needs without government or family assistance. Right now, minimum wage is not at that level. 


Edit: I’m talking about labor that is sold. Of course the labor that comes from scratching your ass or making yourself a sandwich does not have to be compensated. You’re not selling that labor. That is not what “labor” means in this context.


Edit: I understand how free market capitalism works currently. I am advocating for a change. I’m advocating for a regulation on free market capitalism. “Why should a company do this?” Because it’s the law and businesses have to follow labor  laws, if we don’t make this the law, employers will have no incentive.",1

"CMV: America has been groomed to give Service Members too much ""respect""",2555,323,2017-10-07 05:38:53,"First off, I am a Soldier with 10 years of service and a veteran of OEF. I know just about every soldier feels uncomfortable hearing ""thank you for your service"", because we mostly feel like ""thank you"" is not necessary. With that being said... American citizens give us too much credit. 

Our country has been at war longer than it ever has been before. Themes of ""support our troops"" have been engrained in citizens for so long, many have begun to put soldiers in a superior position. And it is dangerous. 

Our opinions are no better than any other citizens... I am no better than any other citizen. The tactic of using soldiers as a political football is wrong and disturbing. A recent example of this is the twisting of a peaceful protest against discrimination by police, kneeling during the National Anthem, into disrespect to soldiers. It's important to remember the flag represents every American...NOT JUST SERVICE MEMBERS. These ideas will lead to nationalist thoughts and ideas. 

It's unfortunate. If anyone challenges a service members political opinion, especially on a public forum like social media, they risk being crucified.

Our opinions are not any better, and are often based on passion over logic. Passion that comes from years of giving our all. But that passion can make us not see clearly. 

Citizens as well as current and former service members need to speak out against giving service members blanket support because of their service. We need to really challenge ideas from all sides and apply clear logic and critical thinking when we form opinions.",1
"CMV: If Jesus came to US politics, most conservatives/Republicans would be against him and his views",2559,989,2018-08-07 14:52:37,"I think most teachings of Jesus are liberal in nature. Conservatives (if they didn't know he is literally Jesus) would be against him, and oppose his views.

Here is a rundown of some of the views that conflict between Jesus and traditional conservatives:

WAR:

Jesus: Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God. \[Matthew 5:9\]

Cons: Traditionally ""war hawks"". Supported invasions of Vietnam and Iraq more than most liberals.

PUNISHMENT:

Jesus: If any one of you is without sin, let him be the first to cast a stone at her. \[John 8:7\] Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy. \[Matthew 5:7\] But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. \[Matthew 6:15\]

Cons: Support death penalty and harsher punishments for criminals. (""X is soft on crime"")

TAXES:

Jesus: Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's. \[Matthew 22:21\]

Cons: Resist taxes in all forms.

GREED:

Jesus: In the temple courts \[Jesus\] found men selling cattle, sheep and doves and other sitting at tables exchanging money. So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple area, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.  \[John 2:14 & 15.\] You cannot serve both God and Money. \[Matthew 6:24.\]

Cons: Strive for tax cuts and less regulations that benefit big corporations. Support free markets over literally anything else.

INCOME INEQUALITY:

Jesus: Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; a man's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions. \[Luke 12.15.\] But when you give a feast, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. You will be repaid at the resurrection of the just. \[Luke 14:13 &14.\]

Cons: No qualms about income inequality. Oppose social programs.

COMPASSION:

Jesus: Love your neighbor as yourself. \[Matthew 22:39\] So in everything, do to others as you would have them do to you. \[Matthew 7:12.\]

Cons: Hate towards immigrants, refugees, traditionally more racist/sexist/homophobic. ""Not in my backyard"".

OVERALL:

Jesus was liberal at his core. He rejected the old, orthodox views on religion and life. He represented and brought forth radical change that was based on inclusion, compassion, equality, tolerance and love. Quite literally too, because historically Christianity gained wide public support from the masses precisely because it was open to all. You didn't have to be part of the chosen people like Jews, in order to be saved.

So, everything that conservatives today would oppose. Conservatism of today seems to be of exclusion, inequality, intolerance and hate. Conservatives cannot even tolerate Kaepernick protesting. So if Jesus would come today, conservatives would be the authorities that condemned him to death.

"CMV: When hanging out with friends, it is rude to speak a language not everyone in the group can understand",2546,162,2019-04-22 00:52:38,"Hello CMV! Before anything I wanna give a bit of context: I'm Brazilian and this specific social situation happened to me often particularly in two moments: the first being when I lived in England and the second is right now, that I'm living in China.



I was in England through a Brazilian scholarship, which means that I was there with a rather big group of Brazilians. And whenever there were get-togethers that involved people from other countries, a rather big portion of my friends would insist in speaking Portuguese (our first language, for those who don't know) while there were people around us that obviously couldn't understand. Everyone in the Brazilian group had (at least) a decent enough level of English so there was no ""real"" excuse for speaking Portuguese other than sheer laziness. If I was participating the conversation, I'd simply ""force"" switching to English in other to include people that couldn't understand Portuguese. And right now I'm in the other end, I'm the one that can't understand the group's language. I'm learning Chinese, but my level still simply isn't enough to follow a conversation between locals and respond fast enough. I can understand the topic, and agree or disagree, or add something if someone ask me directly, but it's just still really frustrating to follow a conversation entirely in Chinese. And exactly like it happened with my Brazilian friends, most of my Chinese friends while having at least a good understanding of English, they insist in having long discussions in Chinese while I'm sitting in front of them.



Don't get me wrong, since I'm studying Chinese that's the perfect opportunity for me actually use what I learn in very real life situation and this is great! My local friends are lovely people and I'm sure they don't mean to exclude me. Plus, as I added in my first experience, my Brazilian friends did EXACTLY the same thing, if not worse (cause at least my friends here are aware I study Chinese). But my point here is how that's something easily ignored by people. So yeah, I personally hate this situation to my core and I wish I could see it as something normal rather than rude. Please change my view!

Edit: I just woke up and will start replying/giving deltas while I commute, it will take a bit to go through the answers!


**Edit 2:** A few people are focusing a lot on my examples, especially in my experience in China. So, first thing: I'm close enough to my local friends to be aware of their level. So I know how much they can speak, and I honestly don't think they're particularly rude to me, when we first met it did bother me a bit more but I sucked it up and nowadays that my level is a bit higher (and we're much closer) I don't care as much. **It doesn't change the fact, however, that I think the action by itself is somewhat rude and often overlooked by society**, and that's not country related (even if some cultures are more likely to act like this for some reason, as it seems the case from some comments). I'm only using this as an example on how people easily close themselves in ""country bubbles"" when living abroad (which is related to the discussion but it's another topic), therefore ditching entirely the courtesy of speaking a second language (when the person is able to) so that you don't isolate your fellow non-speaker.",1

(I got your back, short dudes 🤟) and to be honest, not only does it make me uncomfortable when a woman starts complimenting my height I truly despise it because I know it's a purely sexual thing. It's why I get along far better with women who don't mention it, because I know they get along with me because of my personality and not my looks.

Is there something I'm missing? Some social que I'm not picking up on? Because my friend acted like I am some kind of idiot. I don't think so. Change my mind. ",1
CMV: The internet should be given Utility status,2526,301,2019-06-23 21:17:34,"I'm sure that what this varies by state, but where I'm at it means there's a whole lot more government oversight. Investagatory authorities to control oversight, some basic privacy rules, enforcement if they fail to do their jobs, and maybe even some good old fashioned constitutional rights. It also means they cant jack prices up at a locale without getting permission from the State Senate, my personal favorite. As an indepensible public information tool, I believe the internet should be made a utility, just like telephone companies once they became essential.

Edit: I keep seeing this come up so I'll add this here; utility status is not the same as direct oversight. The government does not own the internet. It basically requires web companies to act in good faith in the interests of their customers.",1
CMV: America is not exceptional bastion of freedom anymore,2522,1041,2017-06-22 21:29:55,"A comedian once said something along the lines: I don't get why everyone here is so excited and proud about American freedom. Like yeah, we got freedom. But so does almost everybody else. America is free, sure. So is UK. Canada is free. France is free. Germany is free. Australia and New Zealand are free. Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, Spain are free. Japan is free. Belgium is free. So get over it. 

EDIT: This was the clip I was thinking about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q49NOyJ8fNA

I agree with him. I understand that in 18th and 19th century USA was exceptional compared to the rest of the world. I understand the historical perspective. But that is not case anymore, has not been in a long while, but still, to this day, Americans spout their freedom-liturgy in news and politics to the annoyance of the rest of the world. I feel like many Americans still believe in that their country is exceptional is some freedom-index, and therefore superior, but I disagree. 

What freedoms Americans have that rest of the developed world does not? Speech? Nope. Religion? No-no. I can only think of that your laws about carrying guns are more lenient than elsewhere. But many countries have freedoms Americans do not. 

An example: Freedom of movement in nature. In Nordic countries (where I am from) everyone can go to ~~public~~ forests and hang around there, making camp, picking up berries and mushrooms or firewood, and as long as you do not disturb others or nature, it is your right to be there. As I am aware, this is not a thing in USA, but very much a basic freedom here in Nordic countries. If there is a forest or a hill, you are allowed to go there and stay. No one will threaten to shoot you for doing so. 

Another example: Political freedom. USA is a two-party system. You can vote for other parties too, but in reality your political leaders and lawmakers always come from either party. You either vote one of them, or whoever you voted is not elected. Many other countries are not two-party systems. If either/none of the current parties appease you or fit your agenda, you can vote for a third (or fourth, or fifth, or sixth) party and chances are they can become big enough to get into the government. There are many recent examples of this, former fringe-parties gaining popularity with changing times and gaining responsibility for the country too. In USA this is only theoretical possibility. Like in some former communist countries, where you could vote, but if you did not vote the party favored candidate, you vote did not actually matter and your candidate did not get elected. 

One more example: Freedom to use drugs recreationally. Netherlands (where my brother-in-law is from) is the classic example. You want to smoke weed without getting arrested? Go ahead, in Netherlands there are many places you can do so. In USA prisons are full of drug-users. 

Also the big thing is the American dream. But American dream has not been true or exceptional for many, many years. It is less true in America than many other places, as USA's social mobility is in fact, low. If you are American you are less likely to change your social position by hard work, than in many other developed countries. Not more likely, less. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility#/media/File:Social_mobility_is_lower_in_more_unequal_countries.jpg

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socio-economic_mobility_in_the_United_States#/media/File:The_Great_Gatsby_Curve.png

So, you know, America is fine. Good on freedoms, not bad on social mobility. Before you guys were exemplary, now the rest of the world has caught up. So, can we please tone down the rhetoric a bit? CMV!

"CMV: If an ISP sells your data, you deserve a cut of the profit.",2512,259,2017-04-05 00:11:57,"My position is quite simple. My browser history is mine. I made it. If an ISP is going to sell it, then I deserve a portion of the proceeds.

I've had similar debates before and one thing that comes up is: it would only be fractions of a penny. When an ISP sells personal data they don't sell it person by person. They consolidate their data into blocks of hundreds of thousands of individuals and sell that. The data of one person isn't worth much at all (depends on the person I guess) but the data of one of these blocks is. So for me to claw out the value of just my data, may only be pennies and my cut of those pennies might not even be half. 

However, I dislike the idea that I am just suppose to accept that someone else gets to sell the product of my work. It's like someone trying to sell the dust from your footsteps. If they're going to do it, I deserve a share of the money. I'm the one doing all the walking. 

**EDIT**

I can be very stubborn. I wouldn't be here on the internet bitching about pennies if I were not a silly, bitter person. While my mind has not been changed, all the people participating have valid persuasive criticisms. In responding, many required me to think and re-think my position. 

To just stop being an old man yelling at clouds is also compelling. 

Thank you for the discussion.

"CMV: Calling out Black Americans for ""Acting White"" is Racist",2514,830,2017-10-02 21:05:53,"Based on a recent CMV I made, a lot of people seem to suggest that it's acceptable to call a black American who speaks ""white"" English ""acting white"" or ""kow-towing"" to white culture.

Similarly, I have also read articles and seen media interviews where a black conservative would be criticized for being an ""Uncle Tom"" for not supporting liberal policies.

To me, this type of behavior is outrageous; it presumes that all black people must conform to a certain type of ""black behavior"", or else they are betraying their race or culture. However, it seems to me that polite society tolerates this type of aggression against black people, especially when it comes from other black people.

Am I missing something? Why is this type of behavior not racism that should be universally condemned?  Why is it being tolerated and even perpetuated by people who are supposedly against racism?

CMV: Slow-motion replays rarely make videos funnier. More often than not it just ruins the joke,2508,81,2020-01-02 10:22:37,"Seeing a video that was funny to begin with, now with voices pitched down and with choppy FPS, is just pointless and annoying.

It's the equivalent of repeating the punchline of a joke to the audience who are already laughing, but you do it really slowly so it feels kinda pandering, and it just makes you feel dumb for laughing the first time.

It's one thing if there's new information, like a new camera angle, or if it's actually filmed in slow-motion, or even if there is a lot to focus on so the viewers might need to see it again. But if it's just someone falling over and screaming, what is honestly the point of showing it again? I see it all the time and I just don't get it. How is it funny?",1

It’s obvious that a sub for memes about water isn’t racist. That’s because context matters when determining these sorts of topics.

It seems like Reddit decided that the n-word is “shocking and offensive” regardless of context. By that logic, r/blackpeopletwitter should also be quarantined because half of their posts contain “shocking and offensive language.” Now r/waterniggas users have to settle for lukewarm alternatives like r/hydrohomies.

A lot of kids will stay up way to late because either they put off the homework until later, or they do nore than they need. They either cram for a test they don't need to study over an hour for, or do more work for whatever project they have to do. 

I know a lot of people have a lot of homework, but even if you don't get home until 6 and have to eat, you shouldn't have over 4 hours of homework. 

They also don't take the breaks they need. They might think that since they have so much homework, they need to stay up and do it nonstop to finish faster, but it actually causes you to take longer.

"CMV Parties are for politicians, citizens should remain independent and register as such.",2505,163,2019-11-28 23:01:07,"ill be using ‘we’ to refer to ‘we the people’
And ‘they/them’ to refer to those in positions of power.


I don’t always talk politics...  but when I do... I say screw both parties, and Usually the people I talk to agree, whichever way they lean.  They might have reasons for why this party is ‘the lesser evil’ but I haven’t come across many people who are genuinely happy with either party.  If you are happy with one of the two parties Id love to hear about it.

Registering as an r or d is effectively voting ahead of time, and publicly.  Your now in a category of person who is active politically and can be assigned a color. Your vote should be earned and you shouldn’t make up your mind ahead of time.  Your also being factored into political data which is used to strategize how to win a state or district and has moved away from anything remotely resembling a genuine presentation of political policy.

Registering as independent is a far more effective means of protesting the two party system rather than doing nothing.  A rising number of independent voters would affect the political strategy of both sides.  Elections are won by slim margins and a substantial independent voting block would make it harder to play the game, and harder to play around the party lines, they might even have to start saying what they really think but let’s not get carried away.

Conservative and liberal values are both essential for a healthy society and we should all be more open in discussing what each side is good at and bad at, rather than blaming and demonizing the opponent.  A third, and better yet unaffiliated, group would help to break up the back and forth. 

Instead of essentially asking the politicians to change through protests, we the people need to change how we interact politically and make them adapt to us.  The red/blue binary has evolved around our opinions and we need to stop giving out free information. 

If you genuinely believe in your party and want to put your support out there I won’t tell you not to.  But consider the tinge of inauthenticity that often accompanies public displays.  Publicly displaying your religious affiliation without being asked or beating some drum is often an attempt to gain attention and acquire affirmation to gird your own lack of faith or some other motive.  Keep your beliefs personal and private, what you believe is best shown through action and it will become obvious if your words contradict them.

Ultimately this country was designed around the idea that democracy requires citizens to be skeptical of those in power.  Skepticism should be your default,  do not back a parties nominee simply because of their affiliation or because you’ll never vote for ‘the other guys’.  We set the tone, and the blame for this political divide can be laid at our feet for playing into it for so long.  If a substantial independent block came out of the woodwork, we would also have more independent politicians come out of that movement. Let’s change the narrative, rise above the binary, and claim independence from the two party system. Register independent, don’t give away your opinion too easily or atleast keep them guessing

Edit:

Trying to be a good op. I’ve read most and appreciate the feedback, wish I had more time to respond to each.  I realize why we have two parties and how it developed... I realize registering is a way to engage with your chosen party and have your say in the primaries and work with what we have in place.  It is my position that our willing participation is being used against us to stay one step ahead of public opinion, probably developed by trying to stay ahead of the other side or idk who or what started it but now both parties are deeply invested in controlling the narratives.(and no I dont think this is new phenomena). I’m not gonna dive into this you either see it or you don’t.

What I’ve observed so far is that It’s pretty easy to guess where someone is at left/center/right by the comments alone.  I believe this is mostly because the two parties while not homogeneous are essentially adapted to appeal to all that we hold sacred depending on your personality, a and b if you like.  Both sides do it.  It has been beneficial to my perspective and how I examine politics as a whole to say ‘I am independent’ and I will assume nothing as best I can, because I know nothing.  I hear people assert republicans are by association or somehow inherently racist like it’s a given.. And plenty of people on the right think a lot of liberals are godless sadists who actually enjoy getting abortions.  Whatever the example you want it’s all fucking wrong, extreme views are almost always wrong or oddities presented as common... that person across the aisle is standing there because they believe in something that matters just like you do but we can’t seem to communicate about it anymore.  We’ve divulged into a state of total non-cooperation,  the two parties are like the left and right brain, two brains one body and they can’t communicate anymore, that’s a problem.

I choose to be independent because my conscience cannot allow me to be apart of this ‘pick your poison’ dilemma.  I also cannot burry my head in the sand.  This is a solution I see that helped me look at things with less bias and I’m not expecting it to be revolutionary or even new but we are all responsible for everything so just think twice about who you blame things on. The easiest way to be completely and totally wrong about something is to be convinced you are right.  Also, Thanks for the insults toward my intelligence, live long and prosper",1
CMV: Politics is a good reason to end a relationship,2507,640,2018-12-22 17:39:18,"I remember there being a small rash of news stories about couples, some married for years, breaking up in the wake up of the Trump election as a result of who people voted for. A similar thing happened on a smaller level with Brexit in the UK. 

This was met with a lot of comments from people in news sites saying that was a stupid reason to break up, but I disagree. ' Politics' isn't just a game politicians play, or something that happens away from the world. Political views reveal a lot about beliefs on society, rights, justice, and basically political views are very intertwined with personal morality. 

Having a partner who challenges you is good, but wide differences are a legitimate break in a relationship. I would argue the couple who broke up after years of marriage in the wake of the American election didn't break up trivially because political parties  suddenly became important, but that they'd ignored that aspect of their relationship if neither was interested in politics, and the election revealed some very deep personal divides which were irreconcilable.

So, political differences can be a make or break aspect of a relationship, and justifiably so. ",1
"CMV: Affirmative Action Should Be Banned on Basis of Race, But Should Be Focused on Income",2502,726,2020-01-06 06:26:50,"Affirmative Action was created to help blacks and Hispanics get into college why not use it to help the poor?

We see in America that the middle class is getting squashed to death. Poor people have a hard time getting into college due to expensive costs and the fact that many don't believe college is beneficial. A rich person has the resources they need to become educated than a poor person. Poor people actually do worse in academics compared to richer people. Why not help the poor and lift them up?

Affirmative Action on race is racist too. Why limit the amount of Asians in a college when they worked their butts off? I read somewhere that Asians get -50 points on average subtracted in SAT scores when applying to college. Whites get 0 points off. Hispanics get +130 points. Blacks get +200. Asians have to try harder as a result just because of their race, something they can't control. If that Asian is poor? They're screwed essentially.

But on basis of income, it helps everyone regardless of race or gender or whatever if you are poor.",1
"CMV: Humanity has yet to master or even invent a form of government/economy that would sustain us as a species, on a massive scale, indefinitely, in outer space.",2502,417,2019-02-20 20:01:55,"First, let’s presume a few things:

1.) Humanity will eventually have to venture off this planet if we are to survive as a species because Earth is a very volatile place and could eradicate us fairly easily given the long view of its history. 

2.) We have mastered the technology to create and maintain massive self contained environments powered by finite and renewable resources, whether they be large scale space stations, or planetary habitats. 

3.) We have mastered medicine, agriculture, and any other technologies required for our species to flourish and survive indefinitely in such an environment. 

      I hold this view because we do, in a way, already live on a sort of space station, with finite and renewable resources, and seem to be living in a very unsustainable way. I see our time here on Earth as a sort of practice run for the big game out amongst the starts I guess. As of right now, we don’t stand a chance, specifically in terms of governing people and economies in a mutually beneficial and sustainable manner.

"CMV: Prostitution (or escort, call it whatever you want) should be fully legal as long as no human traffic was involved and everybody consented",2501,351,2018-08-27 23:55:41,"Correct me if i'm wrong, but I believe right now in many parts of Western nations, USA included, prostitution is illegal. Even escort is considered at best as semi-legal and can still often be shut down if government deems that sex is explicitly involved.

&#x200B;

I believe the two main arguments for why this is so is because of human traffic, and health. For human traffic, i find this a poor argument because you don't ban prostitution simply because a part of prostitution is sponsored by human traffic. It's not fair to the rest of prostitution which does NOT involve human traffic. Analogy is like how you don't ban alcohol simply because some people abuse it.  If human traffic is a problem, then fix that directly without making a blanket ban.

&#x200B;

As for health argument, it is also a poor argument because by that logic, I can claim anything which leads to poor health should be banned. Should we ban HIV-people from having sex? Should we ban obese people from eating McDonalds? Government doesn't have a say in how people should live their lives, including risky behaviors. To ban it completely due to health reasons is ridiculous.

If I miss anything else, feel free to comment and i'll see if that can change my mind.

CMV: Plea deals are a symptom of how broken our justice system is.,2488,242,2019-10-21 23:59:23,"When defendants have to choose between spending years more of their life in jail if they want to contest their innocence, it is a sign that something is horribly wrong. When prosecutors have discretion to add on more or less charges to force these deals they are being granted way too much power over these people’s lives.

We currently lack enough judges, lawyers and court rooms to handle all of the cases that might occur if plea deals were not so widely used. But maybe that implies that we are not increasing the supply of qualified people quickly enough.

And if it is hard to increase the supply because people are difficult to train, maybe we need to figure out how to simplify parts of our justice system so more people can really have their day in court. In our age of information technology, it is crazy that this industry has not gotten more efficient.

Some incentive for getting people to save society’s resources makes sense. Maybe there should be a monetary cost to going to trial, or a monetary reward (maybe spending time in a slightly nicer prison?) for agreeing to a plea deal. But when people are forced to put years of their life on the line to contest their innocence then something is really wrong with our system.",1
"CMV: Much like jealousy or envy, feeling offended is something everyone should work to get rid off.",2486,569,2020-02-11 06:19:26,"Feeling offended (I wish there was a single word for it) is in a terrible feeling to be had because it 1. Implies people can make you feel things, instead of feelings being the result of your interpretation of events, 2. Breeds misunderstandings and conflict and 3. Makes people feel like they don't need to work on their problems or insecurities because they can always twist the responsability towards the other person.

Some caviats: I realize there is a big difference between being offended by some casual comment that comes off wrong and being offended by someone who actively is trying to offend you. However, I think the first situation could very easily be solved by talking honestly, and feeling offended in the second one is only a reflection of insecurities, because you can judge someone's bad behavior without feeling offended.

I think people only feel offended when they think what the person says has some power over them. If it's racism, they feel undermined. If it's about beauty, they feel insecure. And so on. If you use this feeling to guide yourself into becoming happier with who you are, instead of being worried about how to make people not say those things, you'd be much happier.

Building things (in this case, yourself) is much better than destroying, even if the thing you're destroying is indeed bad.

CMV: Girls overspending shouldn't be encouraged as a regular 'girl behaviour' or just simply accepted,2483,140,2019-06-04 21:25:24,"Just a couple moments ago my mom had this discussion with my sister about how women generally want to buy a lot of things namely clothes and bags. I know know there are also several men who overspend but that behaviour isn't generally encouraged as much as women. For example(real life): I tried to buy 3 phone casing because I got used my previous 2 untill it broke and I am called an overspender, money waste, blah blah blah, but when my sister bought 5 casings for her old phone even though each one is still in decent conditions everyone is fine with it. Another one is when I talked about how I bought a game for 120 thousand rupiah I got nagged by everyone in my family saying I am wasting monety. But yet when my sister asked my parents to buy a really expensive branded bag those mcms and stuff.

CMV: it's hypocritical to simultaneously believe that 1) people should have to pull themselves up by their bootstraps if they're unsuccessful and 2) we should make any effort to support people who have lost their coal/factory/industry jobs due to technological progress,2486,243,2017-09-10 01:42:21,"The big argument I've seen for supporting industries like the coal industry is that failing to support those industries results in tremendous job loss and the further deterioration of the working class of America.  I don't necessarily disagree with the facts of that argument. I think it's probably true.

However, it seems hypocritical to me that a lot of the support for keeping these industries alive come from the right, which is ostensibly the side of the political aisle that believes in the free market and the fact that people who have lost their jobs should just ""get another one,"" or people who are poor just aren't working hard enough. It seems weird to me that a right-wing individual would look at a coal miner's family living in poverty in West Virginia and think of them any differently than a family living in poverty in Queens. Shouldn't they all just figure out a way to make more money? That's what a lot of people in Queens (and lots of other inner cities) are told by the right.

This is somewhat connected to the recent discussions of DACA - it also seems weird to me that the right wants to send *away* from America the people who seem to embody the American Dream of pulling themselves up by their bootstraps and getting an education/job/etc. The big argument against DACA and illegal immigrants is that ""they take jobs,"" but again--why should any right wing person have sympathy for people who are losing their jobs to immigrants?

General education is not useless but in these developing countries it seems rather waste of resource for people living under poverty line to get waste years of their life when they can start earning by working. Besides various sectors that require higher education are still not developed here so they usually have to go abroad which most people can't afford.

Edit:

Thanks for all the inputs. I'm also doing my own searching and reading. I would also appreciate any dense material if any of you guy can refer. Some of you are thinking that I wanted to fully abandon general education thats not the case. I want more priority over General Education. I think the fact that most people in these countries cannot afford years of general education instead they send their child to work as child labor should be taken into consideration. If more focus was on vocational they might get more incentive to educate them as they may earn more.

>SANDERS: Because we have a wealth tax. Elizabeth has a good one. Ours is a little bit tougher on Mr. Bloomberg than hers. We're going to raise it in a progressive way, which deals with income and wealth inequality, and makes certain, finally, that health care in this country is a human right, not a privilege.

&#x200B;

Elizabeth Warrren has also had a hard time explaining this plan, which is very similar to Bernie's as I understand it.

&#x200B;

>At the debate, as throughout the campaign, Warren [refused to provide any specifics](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/10/elizabeth-warrens-risky-dodge-health-care-and-taxes/600073/) about how she would fund a single-payer plan. Instead, whether questioned by moderators or challenged by other candidates, she recycled variants on the same talking points she has used in venues from campaign town halls [to a recent appearance on *The Late Show With Stephen Colbert*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Yiga2dDysQ). Rather than explaining what revenue she would raise to fund the plan, Warren insisted that under single payer, middle-income families would save more money with the elimination of health-care premiums, co-pays, and deductibles, regardless of any taxes imposed. “Costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down,” she said at the debate.

It seems pretty clear to me that both Warren and Sanders have a very hard time explaining how they're going to pay for medicare for all. When they're pressed for specifics, or to explain away that 25 trillion dollar gap as Mayor Pete pointed out, they don't have a good answer, or refuse to answer.

In my view, this is damning. Maybe someone can help them out.",1
CMV: The idea of “Believe all women” in regards to sexual assault doesn’t really make sense and/ or doesn’t mean anything.,2464,1163,2020-03-27 10:13:30,"So once again a claim of sexual assault has become a big story and this point occurred to me and I’d like to hear what other people thing. 

Basically, I dont understand why anyone would say “believe all women” or “we should believe women automatically” Are you saying that there should be a different legal standard in sexual assault/ rape cases? Ie. guilty until proven innocent? If so that is an interesting if legally unfounded opinion. If you think that we should take sexual assault allegations more seriously, than that’s a valid opinion, but ultimately if a woman makes a credible claim of sexual assault, people tend to listen (granted not always) in the same way that people listen if you say you were physically assaulted. In a practical sense, if you go to the police in good faith and report a crime, they have no reason not to believe you, now again, if the issue is that you think there is misconduct and a given case isn’t being taken seriously enough, than thats a valid point and one that I’m interested in.

All that said my main belief is that “believe all women” doesn’t really make sense and people should stop saying it. Besides that I would be interested to hear what other people think that phrase means, or why it might be useful in discourse.",1
"CMV: Fascist and Nazi as insults are widely overused, completely misunderstood by those who use them, and should (almost) never be used if one wants to be taken seriously.",2457,376,2019-04-08 19:44:52,"To start of: I am not talking about obvious Nazi or Fascist movements like 'Blood and Honor', 'Golden Dawn' etc. which certainly deserve this title. Nor am I talking about idiotic young Nazis who run around with Tiki-Torches who do the 'Heil Hitler' salute.

I believe that if most people hear Nazi/Fascist they think 'Racism, Anti-Antisemitism, Führer', which is obviously not wrong in the sense that all these things are true, but they don't capture the ideologies behind it. 

National Socialism and Fascism were both historic movements deeply rooted in their times. One of the most important ideological pillars of the Nazi movement was that of Lebensraum (Important enough to be understood by most English speakers). They had a very weird and confusing position regarding Christianity, and last but not least their economic policies were equally complex (and inconsistent) but shouldn't be left out of the picture. There is much more than to mention here. Most people don't give a fuck about those details (Which is fair) but they also shouldn't call people 'Nazi' without understanding what that actually means.

All these things and more should be taken into consideration when deciding to call someone a Nazi or a Fascist.

Not that I am not saying that to 'protect the feelings of the poor victims of these accusations'. I think that those words slowly lose the horrific message they still carry. If you say 'I met a Nazi the other day' do you mean some racist who thinks we should close borders and only allow 'white immigration'? Or a guy who laughed about the holocaust and said 'We should have gotten more of them'? I am honestly baffled that people don't see a real difference here. Not to dispute that both people are assholes, at least from my perspective. 

**When in Gods name did attributes like 'Racist, Anti-Semite, Authoritarian, Anti-Democrat' became so harmless that you have to call someone a Nazi because they just don't do anymore?**

Not convinced yet? Maybe ask yourself when to call someone a Nazi and when to use the term Fascist? Are they completely interchangeable? Is Nazism a certain form of Fascism (As I think)? If so, what does make guy/girl XYZ a Nazi, not a Fascist? Where do the Japanese fit in?

TLTR: People don't have a clue what Nazism and Fascism really are. Most people are neither. If you wanna be taken seriously don't use that word as a random insult but instead fall back on attributes like racist, etc. which are more clearly defined and not dependent on multi faceted historic periods.

CMV: The “self love” movement is for-profit and not at all what we need right now.,2459,157,2019-10-02 00:01:04,"so no matter your political affiliation and no matter where you live right now, shit is crazy. i can’t help but think this sudden cultural shift towards “self-love” is antithetical to what we need. 

by all means i believe in self-acceptance and realizing one’s self-worth. go to therapy and all that. but the reason this entered the public consciousness in the first place are building stress levels and a crisis of anxiety and depression among millennials and gen zers. and so, of course, companies took the general openness with which people would talk about their mental health and feelings of self-doubt to...sell you shit. love your skin! buy Dove! love your curves! buy my $50 plus sized jeans!

i think the real focus here should be why, exactly, there is this sudden upswing of stress and inner turmoil among people. not to be all “get a load of this society”, but jesus christ. productivity is at an all time high and the global economy has been all over the place. these are uncertain times for anyone who isn’t a millionaire, and there’s little to be done about it but sit and watch.

what i think we should be emphasizing is togetherness and solidarity with one another. times are tough. and i think a big part of loving yourself is loving other people. there is a certain spiritual emptiness to modern people, that i think shit like self love sort of fills. but i feel like senses of community—in what any capacity that is to you—is what makes you swell with self worth. more than face masks, at least. idk. just my thoughts 🤘🏼",1
CMV: Most routine health care visits could be managed by a technician instead of a doctor,2448,401,2020-04-27 22:33:22,"There is a huge concern about health care cost and access in the US, but every time I go to the dentist, I have to have at least a visit with the actual dentist who tells me 'we'll keep an eye on [the same thing for 3 years] and keep flossing and brushing'. When I get my (not complicated) eyeglass prescription 'updated' to the same damn prescription, I have to see the optometrist. When I get my medication for a chronic illness refilled again after being on it for literally years, I have to see the doctor ... Maybe a nurse practitioner.

I'm not saying we don't need highly skilled, highly educated people providing healthcare. I'm just saying, why bring in the dentist when the hygienist is the one who spends all their time in my mouth? Why have an optometrist give me the '2 or 3' ... '1 or c' drill when it usually pops in exactly where the tech put it? Do glasses prescriptions *really* need to be all that up-to-date in the first place? I get needing to check in on my symptoms and the drug side effects before a refill, and occasionally offering alternatives, but 4 times out 5, it's 'everything's great. Thanks doc, just like I told the intake nurse.""

I have my opinions about how healthcare should be paid for, but regardless of who foots the bill, the priesthood of doctors seems a little weird for most everyday visits.",1
CMV:Alcoholics Anonymous is heavily flawed from a scientific perspective and hasn't tried to improve it's system since it's inception,2446,668,2018-04-03 22:40:31,"I have a friend who has been attending AA meetings recently because he was ordered to do so in some fashion after getting a DUI (for the record I don't know if that means he was given a true option or made to attend or ""choose"" jailtime) and the whole thing has got me thinking about whether or not AA works and if sobriety is even the intended outcome of the program. Below I've listed the famous 12 steps and below that are my relatively disorganized thoughts on the program having looked into it for the first time in any in depth manner. This means that I’m still in the early stages of my views and can be very much subject to change.

1.	We admitted we were powerless over alcohol—that our lives had become unmanageable.

2.	Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.

3.	Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understoodHim.

4.	Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.

5.	Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.

6.	Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.

7.	Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.

8.	Made a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them all.

9.	Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.

10.	Continued to take a personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.

11.	Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.

12.	Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs.

My current view is that because of the lack of change of the steps over the years since the 30’s suggests a lack of improvement that would be unacceptable in any other field of treatment for diseases. Here are some of my thoughts on the matter.

First up, as many have pointed out, there's a whole lot of God involved throughout the 12 steps (6 direct references and 7 if you count #2), I'm not sure how this is supposed to appeal to athiests such as my friend. If a person does not believe in God they will be put off from the program from the start making it much harder to reach their goal of sobriety.

If alcoholism is a disease then why does AA treat it simply as a matter of will power? I wouldn't try to treat cancer with prayer alone, and for the record there are various medical treatments for alcoholism. 

There is also a stigma of personal failure when people relapse which doesn't make sense for a couple of reasons. First, if it's a disease then people are sick which means that blaming them for not being able to control their health adds a layer of shame which can only do harm to the person's primary goal of getting sober. In turn this will increase the time to get sober because it will add time to get over that shame before starting again. Shame does nothing to help get a person back on track as far as I can tell. Second, you would never assign blame to a person with cancer who has gone into remission and then had the cancer come back, why would we do the same for literally any other illness?

AA does not collect statistics of their success and failure rates, nor has it's program changed since it's inception. We wouldn't accept that from any other sort of treatment. If we didn't collect that information we would still have the same poor treatment of HIV that we did in the 80s and 90s, same goes for cancer, and just about any other illness you can name. I will say that talking about your issues with people is a good thing, but as far as I can tell that's just about the only thing that that this program gets right, everything else seems to be heavily flawed from a scientific perspective if not outright illogical. 

Finally it seems that AA believes it’s program is a one size fits all program when we know that many ailments require different treatments for different people. This is especially true for ailments that affect people mentally which I think it’s safe to say that addiction falls under that same umbrella. People deal with various addictions in different ways, why AA treats alcohol as a one size fits all approach I can’t say, maybe I’m wrong, but based on the text of their twelve steps and twelve promises that doesn’t seem to be the case. Instead they seem to say that the only reason people fail is because the fail to give themselves over fully to the program which seems to be very very odd.

CMV: There is no good reason to leave a note on a comment after editing it for typos,2443,186,2019-10-17 13:50:15,"Is this some aspect of internet etiquette I missed out on at internet school? 

Too often, I'll be scrolling through comments on Reddit, and come across one with a footnote that reads:

Or even worse:

EDIT: a word

I understand and support leaving edit notes for developing stories or when *content* needs to be corrected after the fact. That makes sense.  But spelling? Seriously? When you turn in an essay or publish an article you wouldn't leave a footnote saying:

Who cares if you proofread your work? Why is that so special it deserves a footnote? Correct your typos and move on. You're *supposed* to proofread your work. It's assumed we all try to do so.

CMV: Five years later: Michael Brown was not a victim of police brutality and is a horrible icon for the BLM anti-police brutality movement.,2446,942,2019-08-09 07:17:21,"Tomorrow is the five year anniversary of the shooting of Michael Brown by officer Darren Wilson, and for almost the entirety of the last five years I've seen him put up on some kind of pedestal as a virtuous victim of yet another racist shooting of an innocent black man. This has been going on since literally hours after the shooting (when the first riots and protests started) till today (NPR is currently doing a ""five years later"" special multi-part series on how Ferguson was impacted by Brown's death, which prompted me to make this post). His shooting inspired nationwide riots and protests. Murals of him have been made. He was on the cover of a TIME magazine. Al Sharpton spoke at his funeral. Obama name dropped him in speeches as some kind of innocent victim of police brutality and offering condolences to his family. 

The dude strong arm robbed a liquor store for blunt wraps. The responding officer was originally quite reasonable until Brown assaulted him. A struggle ensued, in which Brown manhandled and beat the officer while trying to take his gun. A shot went off and Brown ran. Wilson, not wanting this clearly violent criminal to escape, pursued. Then Brown turned on Wilson and charged. Since it was already clear at this point that Wilson had no chance in a physical altercation and Wilson only had his gun on him, he did the only thing that made sense: he shot Brown... and had to empty most of a magazine into Brown before he finally went down. 

Including a guy like that among supposedly genuine victims of police brutality just weakens the cause. It makes me wonder if the ""victim"" standard is really so low, what precisely the movement is fighting for. Anyone who wants to champion an anti-police brutality movement needs to distance themselves from Brown and all the outrage his death caused or risk having their own credibility tarnished since they're clearly willing to defend violent criminals just because the skin color of the criminal and the officer fits a narrative.

"CMV: Loli hentai is disgusting, creepy, and should be banned",2435,849,2019-07-30 07:02:48,"I recently got in an argument with someone defending Loli's and I was shocked.

How are Loli's not child porn? I get there are no real girls but it's still porn of underage girls.

Here is another question. How are you not a pedophile jerking off to Loli's?

Loli's are sexual drawings of very underage girls where guys usually above 18 obsess over them, adore them, and just do weird things to them.

For me it's not that much different than child porn. These are drawings of young girls and degenerate neck beards jerk off to them and like those specific pics because they are so young. Why can't they just jerk off to any other hentai? Because they enjoy how young these girls are.

I also see the argument of how it's just fantasy and not real. Yes they are fake thank God but these guys are still jerking off to them because of there age. These guys still have the fantasy of having sex with underage girls and use Loli's as a way to please that desire.

How come the furry community out right bans bestiality drawings because they find it disgusting and horrible but the hentai community still supports drawings of underage girls? 

I also hear the argument ""Oh we don't want to have sex with them we just adore them and find them so cute!"" That's still weird for me. 30 year olds adoring drawings of 9 year olds. Honestly I don't think there is something right in the head if you adore those pics.

For me Loli's serve no good for anyone and appeal to weird neck beards.

I would love to hear what people have to defend Loli's and actually see if you guys change my views on them.

Main Edit: My view has been changed! Loli's are a way for pedophiles to release there pedophilic urges without actual child porn. If we ban Loli's then these guys would be looking for actual child porn so we should keep it. I do think it's fucking disgusting though

Edit: My view has been changed. I have now realized Loli's are a coping mechanism for perverts to not actually make real child porn and to settle for drawings. I still think it's terrible and disgusting but at least it's keeping guys away from actual child porn

Edit 2: I just have one question. How is Loli's not child porn?",1
"CMV: When you are born you are AUTOMATICALLY registered as an organ donor, regardless of religion or otherwise. If you choose to OPT OUT then, should you ever need an emergency transplant, you are put to the very bottom of the list and all donors are given priority.",2435,725,2018-06-07 20:34:54,"
Additionally: 

Where your parents decide to alter your 'DONOR STATUS' at birth, you are automatically re-registered as a donor at the age of 18 unless you decide to opt out in which case the same applies.

My reasons are two-fold.

1)  If you are not willing to donate an organ if you die, then you should not be held to the same level of entitlement as someone that is.  This is clearly the most equitable standpoint.

2) We should all try to encourage organ donation as 'opt-out' being the status quo.  We are all human after all.

"CMV: Toxic Masculinity exists just as tangibly as Toxic Femininity, and it's unreasonable to focus on one over the other.",2433,670,2019-12-03 23:36:05,"First, I should explain my definition of each term, as everyone seems to interpret it differently: 

""Toxic"" refers to any substance or behaviour that, due to its excess, causes harm.

""Masculinity"" is a collection of traits that are traditionally attributed to males due to their increased prevalence in males as opposed to females.

""Femininity"" is a collection of traits that are traditionally attributed to females due to their increased prevalence in females as opposed to males.

Now, I recently came across a YouTube video about a conversation between feminists and men's rights activists. The topic of the existence of ""toxic masculinity"" struck a chord with me. 

Traditionally male characteristics such as aggressive behaviour, stoic demeanour, and self-assurance are all characteristics that, when exhibited in excess, can be toxic. That much, I agree with.

Despite this, I believe that these traits can be exhibited in a toxic manner by females, despite it never being mentioned. Furthermore, these traits, in regulation, are incredibly helpful in certain situations.

For example, controlled aggression can be equated with being forward and honest. Overcoming fear through bravery does require an aggressive approach, as opposed to a passive one. Acting stoic and masking emotions is important in negotiations, when speaking in public, when in difficult situations, and when accomplishing tasks that outbursts of emotion would hinder.

That said, feminine traits share similar pitfalls and advantages. In my mind, they are both equally important traits to posses and regulate.

So why is one plastered all over the media, while the other one isn't?

Well, I'm of the opinion that it's because feminism, the movement that coined the term ""Toxic Masculinity,"" benefits more from pointing out the flaws in behaviours more frequently seen in men (who make up a minority of feminist groups), than from doing the same to flaws frequently seen in women (who make up the majority of said groups).

I find this bias to be unreasonable, and even harmful, as it demonises men in an unfair manner.

Now, I've never seen any prominent figure so much as mention ""Toxic Femininity,"" much less explain why it is not as relevant to talk about as its masculine counterpart.

This is where I hope that Reddit comes in. Can you offer some insight with regards to the validity of one topic after another? Maybe there's a train of thought I haven't considered yet, beyond plain confirmation bias of feminists and/or tribalism.

(Note: I consider myself an egalitarian, so I don't have anything against feminism itself, just the behaviours its members seem to exhibit, but I see how it can come across like I do.)",1
CMV: Everyone should have easy access to painless death,2440,443,2019-04-01 23:32:03,"&#x200B;

**Description of my view:** Everyone above age of 18 (so that they are capable of making their own decisions), irrespective of whether they are mentally or physically ill should have an easy access to painless suicide, probably by inhalation of Carbon Monoxide. We already have the technology to do that, so my only proposal is to make it's access legal and easy for everyone.

Now, my view does not advocate promotion of suicide. This post is not pro-suicide, but rather pro-choice and anti-pain. In fact I would hope nobody would take the choice given to them. However, everyone should still have a choice.

&#x200B;

Here are some of the arguments in favor of my thesis

1. **Personal liberty:** Everyone should have the right to choose what to do with their lives as long as it does not directly harm others.
2. **Euthanasia is not enough:** The problem with Euthanasia is it covers only sick people and the the Government gets to decide who is sick. That's not OK. I am the sole authority over my life. If I decide, I would like to die, no one should be able to stop me from doing so even if I don't have any problems at all in my life.
3. **Problems currently:** Presently people who have decided to kill themselves have to go through extremely hard time to get it done. Jumping from building, hanging are extremely painful and inefficient methods and has high risks of failure. The consequences of failed suicide attempt are harmful to the person and their close ones.
4. **Anti-pain over pro-life**: Pain, be it physical or mental is single worst problem of humanity. Almost all problems on earth boils down to enduring pain. We should try to eliminate pain as much as possible even if it involves letting people to die. I believe life's value is determined by the value people assign to themselves and not by government, society and certainly not God.
5. **Towards Utopia :** In an utopia, earth should only be populated by those who genuinely wish to be here not and those who do not should have an easy and painless exit.

Let me address some of the arguments against my view myself, so that you need not repeat it in the comments.

1. **Suicide is not OK:** Or any anti-suicide arguments. I have addressed this in personal liberty. You can feel feel to hold your views. But you should not be able to control other peoples views and their personal life choices. I don't see a difference between anti-gay sentiments and anti-suicide sentiments. Both of them are directed against personal choices, about which the society or government has no business to choose.
2. **Loved ones suffer because of the decision:** I think this falls under anti-suicide argument in first point. Yes, they are affected. But so are they if someone they love turn out to be gay, go on a drinking spree, hold a view that they don't and what not depending on the person's beliefs. If someone they love has taken a personal decision, they have no choice but to accept it. This should not stop anyone to have the right to do whatever they want with their own body.
3. **It's not your life to end it:** It's your opinion. You can feel free to hold it. However, if others disagree, let them.
4. **Depressed people are mentally unstable; incapable of taking decisions:** I agree depression is a mental illness and cannot think as clearly as a normal person. However, I believe even they are capable of evaluating their own pain. If they decide their pain is intolerable, they deserve to have a choice to end their lives. Forcing them to stay in this world and making them to take therapy is inhumane. Denying the depressed people access to suicide because they can't think clearly is like forbidding a low IQ person to manage their own finances, because they are not capable of doing it.
5. **Depression can be cured:** or Whatever your problem is, it can be solved. Well their problem may or may not be solved. And they might even potentially have a happier life. But it is irrelevant. If they have decided they have had enough, nobody should have a say in it. Just like nobody should have a say in how someone else should spend their lottery money. Moreover a potential happy life (event A) after cure of depression is not necessarily a better outcome than a painless death (event B). After death, there is nothing. Nothing is just that. Nothing. It's not better or worse than event A. On the other hand, suffering is a worse outcome than a painless death.
6. **The proposal may lead to death due to rash decisions:** I agree it can happen. It may even lead to a miserable lives for their kids or spouse. That's why I think people should take the decisions responsibly, which according to me, they are capable of doing so. I also don't think it's easy to commit suicide psychologically, despite making it easily available. However, if it happens, we would have to live with it.
7. **Easy access may lead to a suicide epidemic:** I will not deny the possibility of this happening. Let me rather address the consequences of the event. As I have addressed in point 4 supporting my view, I think world is better off if less people endure pain even if it is under the cost of losing many lives. While I do not believe it will happen, I don't see a problem even if half of the planet decides to press the suicide button. Or even end of humanity.

Having said this, I believe we should actively dissuade people from committing suicide and campaign them to live. We should also help cure depression as we are already doing now. However despite the efforts, if they choose to end their lives, they should have a choice to do it easily and painlessly.",1
CMV: Women in the United States should be required to sign up for the draft when they turn 18 as well.,2430,800,2018-05-15 04:05:58,"Though the draft has been universally unpopular, the fact that modern era women should not sign up baffles me. If a man were to not sign up for the draft after turning 18 in a timley fashion, he will be fined and possibly jailed. The idea that women are not subject to the same treatment as men is frankly unequal and sexist. Previously based on cultural norms and prejudices it would make sense that they were not required. Now in 2018 with a slew of cultural progression in terms of women's rights, gender norms being toppled, and society celebrating women in powerful positions; why do we not see a change in policy to reflect our cultural progression as a nation? I'm only focusing directly on male and female, race/religion/trans people/etc. A is separate issue in this case. 

Edit: Thank you for all the wonderful responses and those who have taken the time to really think about this CMV. It has come to my attention that some posters are stating a removal of the selective service (draft), while I do agree with you because the U.S. has the largest Volunteer military the law/act exists and the focus is not on repealing the law but instead the equal commitment of men and women. 
One large portion with this argument is that men must sign the selective service agreement in order to express their vote; while women freely receive this right upon turning 18. This is the main point of the CMV. Equal commitment for equal expression. If one must commit to die to express their votes and freedoms while the other freely receives theirs, that is an issue of inequality.",1

However, I've seen this talking used quite a bit on the discussion of *privilege*. Basically that a lot of women have this fear when they're walking alone (usually at night). They see a man and they get scared because this man could potentially be a threat. I 100% understand and empathize with this. 

However, this causes a bit of an internal struggle for me. I'm black. And I've experienced the whole, ""Person moves away from you because they think you're violent"" thing and it feels really shitty. And, in society today, someone would not get away with saying, *""Oh yeah, if I see a black person and it's late at night, I'm instantly fearful for my safety""*. So I'm not sure why an analogous talking point is acceptable when talking about men.

To be fair, I mainly see this talking point in pop feminist and white feminist circles. Because I do think the more intersectional feminists are aware of how that talking point can be misapplied. 

Again, I'm also a feminist. So I would prefer if mostly feminists would be willing to talk with me about this. But if you're an anti-feminist, feel free too. But I may not agree with most thing you have to say. This isn't to call out a hypocrisy. I genuinely want to get over this.

Edit: Okay, I have been getting a deluge of comments that don't seem to be reading what I'm saying or intentionally misinterpreting what I'm saying. **I am not saying that it is wrong or out of bounds for women to cross the street when they see a man. I am speaking specifically to how this can be misapplied to racist people and I have already given several Deltas that actually engage with this point.** I also, apparently, need to clarify: **I AM NOT SAYING THAT YOU, AS A WOMAN, HAVE RACIST MOTIVATED REASONING FOR CROSSING THE STREET**. The point that I'm making with regard to race is an entirely separate issue that I'm merely drawing a parallel too. I've been getting a lot of comments with people justifying their right to cross the street and assuring me that they don't care about race when they cross the street. That was never my question. That was never my point of contention. I would chock this up to me being inarticulate, but many people seem to have understood the gist of what I was getting at and didn't try to argue with me with that framing.

So, any similar replies will be a waste of effort because I'm not going to respond to them. So save your time and mine. Thank you.

Edit 2: I removed a particular line that was pointed out by a response that led them to believe I was implying that all women who are scared of me are automatically racist. Do I think this person was being genuine? Or course they weren't. But I still want to keep the conversation good faith and so I am removing that remark from the original post.",1
CMV: Trump is the Most Impeachable President in US History.,2428,848,2019-09-30 01:10:01,"By ""Most Impeachable"", I mean he's committed the greatest (numerical) definitively impeachable actions.

EDIT:   I believe the number of offenses that Trump has committed since entering office that are 'so bad he should be impeached' is greater than any previous president. 

I hold this view because [we have 'substantial evidence' from the Mueller Report](https://www.lawfareblog.com/obstruction-justice-mueller-report-heat-map) of Trump's actions meeting all 3 requirements for a criminal conviction on Obstruction of Justice for **4 separate incidents.**

In addition, [Trump has violated the Emoluments Clause at LEAST 6 times](https://www.theusconstitution.org/litigation/trump-and-foreign-emoluments-clause/) since he took office.

Further, he's had a multi-decades long relationship with someone [who's been revealed to be a Child-Sex Trafficker.](https://www.vox.com/2019/7/9/20686347/jeffrey-epstein-trump-bill-clinton)  EDIT: Not an impeachable offense.

Finally, now it's revealed that he's abused his power in 1) asserting Foreign Policy for Political Gain and 2) Engaged in a Cover Up to hide this from the American Public.

By my count this adds up to **~~13~~**  12 incidents, each of which are impeachable on their own.

To change my view, you'd need to show by combination that Trump Presidency (so far) has fewer impeachable offenses by

1. Arguing that some of the above 13 offenses aren't impeachable offenses.
2. Arguing that another President in US History had more impeachable offenses.",1
CMV: Alcohol would be illegal if it's use began today,2426,261,2018-04-13 20:15:21,"This CMV relates to the drug alcohol and its use mainly in beverages with the aim or consequence of getting the person into a mental and physical state called 'being drunk'. 
I have had many conversations where people cannot seem to imagine why alcohol would be considered equal or worse in effects than other commonly used drugs like marijuana and cocaine. If we heard news reports today about 'alcohol users' congregating and becoming disinhibited in the behaviour, becoming aggressive and sexual in behaviour, suddenly collapsing in the road and occassionally OD'ing, there would be a scandal and initiatives by governments to 'stop this evil scourge'. Some people will say, a few beers a week will do nothing and don't really change your behaviour but the same is true of the other drugs above, in small amounts. The only reason it is not banned is due to longterm cultural emedding, in everything from weddings to funerals.

"CMV: YouTube rewind will never be ""good"" again",2413,121,2019-12-06 20:18:41,"Now, I'm not hating on YouTube for making a rewind people don't like. Quite the opposite. Before this year's rewind one of the most common criticisms of rewind was that it doesn't represent the YouTube community. I think YouTube has grown so large as a platform that they can't fit enough familiar faces for the majority of people to recognise in a rewind. This leads to most people who watch rewind thinking ""this doesn't represent YouTube, I hardly know anyone in this"". I don't think it is possible for YouTube to create a rewind that the majority will feel represent their perception of the YouTube community purely due to the number of creators compared to how many creators each of us can watch. Looking at numbers, there are over 2400 channels with more than 1mil subs. I'm not sure how many channels the average user actively engages in but it would be lucky to be even 0.1% of this number. Back when YouTube rewinds were liked the ratio of YouTubers engaged with to total YouTubers would have been much higher making it easier for YouTube to show the majority of people familiar creators. As such the like/dislike ratio has been gradually getting worse as the number of creators expands and the concentration of familiar creators in rewind is diluted for viewers. I accept it is possible that I am wrong and YouTube are capable of making a ""good"" rewind. Perhaps my reasoning as to why they won't be ""good"" is flawed and people don't feel like they need to see a lot of their favourite creators in rewind to like the video or even not dislike it. I hope I am wrong and it is possible for YouTube to make a rewind that the majority like, but I really don't think it's possible.",1
CMV: Serena William's sexism claims after losing the US Open are not only false but also dangerous,2413,696,2018-09-12 05:41:41,"As probably all of you know, Serena Williams lost the US Open final to Naomi Osaka, a 20 year-old tennis player from Japan, who won her first Grand Slam. But what made it to the headlines was the outburst that the North-American had after being penalized by the umpire Carlos Ramos.

Now, in my opinion she was correctly admonished by the Portuguese umpire, who just limited himself to follow the rules.

Just to set some common ground: Carlos Ramos barely misses anything from the matches he umpires, so it is likely that he catches any 'coaching' coming from any coach. It is also known that Ramos is known for being relatively strict in what comes to umpiring, having given several violations to the most famous tennis players, such as Nadal, Djokovic, Murray, and of course, Kyrgios. And knowing Serena's temper, it would be predictable that had she gotten even the slightest heated up, she would get at least a warning. Since she screamed at him, calling him a liar and a thief (and using the fact that she's a mother as an excuse, which I'm still trying to figure out how's that an excuse), I guess the outcome is far from surprising. As for the racket being smashed, there's really not much to say; it's a clear violation. So, even though it is arguable that he could have skipped some of his warnings, the fact is that violations were committed and rightfully reprehended, resulting in a one game penalty.

But what I want to discuss here is the fact that Williams turned this into a 'sex discrimination' issue.

Firstly, I think she has only done this because she wanted to find a way to justify the fact that she was visibly inferior to her opponent (who undoubtedly deserved to win, and also definitely deserved more praise following her incredible victory). Secondly, I also think that she is better than all of this, and that she was only caught in the heat of the final.

I think it is a true shame that Serena Williams accuses Carlos Ramos of sexism. Acts of discriminating nature (sexism, racism, xenophobia, etc) are unquestionably wrong and must be censured to its core as far as possible. They bring dishonor and disgust to our society. Which also means that we should be particularly cautious in what comes to identifying this matters. Well, this is exactly the opposite of what the 36 years-old did. She was not careful. Instead, she found an opportunity to unduly play the ""sex card"" as a way of making herself look better after throwing a tantrum in front of her own people. She had nowhere to turn and she chose the victimization path, not only blaming her loss on the ""wrong"" decisions made by the umpire but also hiding her failure behind made up chauvinism claims without grounds.

As far as my opinion is concerned, this allegation is dangerous because it can bring hatred (and more) to Carlos, as well as lower the standards of what is considered sexism, opening up a whole new discussion on what is and what is not ethic in what regards gender treatment. This way some women may feel that they too can play the ""sex card"" for any minor adversity they may have, even when completely disconnected with gender. Thereby, the 'gender balance' that all of us (especially women) are fighting for becomes uneven.

To finish, I think this has only got such worldwide dimensions since sexism is such a trending topic nowadays, with women's self-assurance fairly getting more and more power and attention. And don't get me wrong, I'm all in favor of double standards and equal opportunities, but it is important to look at things impartially and to have a critical eye on what is and what is not discrimination, or else it may have drastic consequences (especially when the main actor has the same influence as Serena).

TL;DR: I think Serena made this sexism thing up to find an excuse for her loss and we have to be careful not to call every little thing as sexist or discriminating or else we will all be little snowflakes that get offended with everything.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Also, as u/Dontcallmeshirlie stated below, there's one more thing to take into account:

> Does he penalize other women more harshly then men? Everyone keeps framing this as Serena vs men = sexism. If Ramos penalizes women in general more harshly then men, then yes that's sexism. If it was just Serena, then I think sexism is a baseless accusation.

"CMV: Anybody should be allowed to sing any rap song lyrics, including lyrics that may cause controversy across racial groups.",2415,1378,2018-05-22 21:09:00,"I’m not sure if this has been covered on this thread yet, but with the recent Kendrick Lamar issue I feel this should be discussed. 

Let me preface real by saying that I am a white male and Kendrick Lamar is one of my favorite rappers of all time. 

For those who haven’t heard, there was recently an incident at a Kendrick show in Alabama where a white girl was invited on stage to rap M.A.A.D City alongside Lamar. She rapped the chorus with includes the n-word multiple times, as many rap songs do. The crowd did not react well and she left the stage shortly after. There has been rumor that this was set up although I have not seen solid evidence yet and honestly don’t expect to. 

Here’s my issue. 

The lyrics are part of the song. Why say them if you don’t want people to repeat them? The argument that white people should not be allowed to repeat these lyrics is very weak, as white people support the artists by attending the concerts and purchasing the music just the way black people do. I understand the history and the cultural aspects of the word, if it is going to spark fires then why continuously repeat it?

In a Travis Scott concert some time back, he held the mic out to a white fan who proceeded to rap lines that included the n-word and Scott allowed it. I feel this is because he understands that he made the lyrics and that people fuck with his music and want to sing along.

I’m not sure if Kendrick had the white girl removed from stage because the crowd was booing and he wanted to keep the peace or if he actually believed she should not be repeating his lyrics. But I do think it was a little shady of the King to do so. 

I’m open to all opinions. I really want to discuss this because I really like Kendrick and don’t want this to change my opinion of him. Furthermore, it is unfair to say white people are not allowed the same rights to rap along to songs as blacks people are. CMV.

"CMV: The class of ""tipped employees"" in the US should be abolished - minimum wage should be guaranteed for all.",2411,894,2016-08-04 18:30:54,"The central problem with the idea of tipped employees in the US is access to justice and fluctuations in tips.

The premise behind the idea is to enable employers to pay their service employees less than minimum wage because their wages are made up for by the tips. But there are two huge problems with this

* Tips are not guaranteed. Social pressure makes them likely, but not certain

* If the employee doesn't get enough tips to technically have made minimum wage, what can they do? Are they going to demand the employer pays the difference? What if the employer says no - what is the employee going to do? Start a class action lawsuit to get their money back?

Given the difficulties in accessing justice and the fluctuations, the class of tipped employees isn't fair. People should be paid minimum wage.

CMV: Restricting the number of new people you can contact each day in an online dating service would make the whole experience of online dating much better for both men and women,2404,180,2019-04-27 21:44:46,"So, I have this idea of how online dating should work to make it better for everyone. I think this idea is amazing, but for some reason dating services don't implement anything like that. So, is there something wrong with the idea that I'm missing?

Based on my own experiences, and the common criticism that other people often have with online dating, it seems to me that the main problem with the whole experience is too much spam.

Women complain that they are flooded with lots of low effort messages, many of them perverted. That makes the whole experience unpleasant.

Men complain that almost all their messages get ignored, and they need to send a lot of them before they find someone who will even reply. That makes the whole experience unpleasant.

So, my idea is to create a limit, for example that you could only contact 3 new people per day. If you're already chatting with someone, you could continue to do so without restrictions, since the limit is only about sending messages to people you don't know yet.

The limit should be absolute, with no way to extend it (for example by paying for a premium account). If someone tries to circumvent it by creating new accounts, all of their accounts should get banned.

That way, women wouldn't be flooded with low quality spam, and men wouldn't have to send so many messages to compete with spammers. They could write just a few, but high effort messages, and have a much bigger chance that someone will read and reply to it.

So, is there anything I'm missing that could make it a bad idea?",1
CMV: Suggesting that people seek invites to things they weren't invited to isn't helping them socially. It's making them look desperate.,2400,110,2019-12-09 07:10:44,"""Why don't you just ask if you can go?"" Well, there's a few reasons why it's dumb to suggest people do this:

1. This is how people get invited out of pity. If they were truly thought of and wanted, they would have been reached out to.
2. It shows desperation. It shows the host/coordinator/whoever that the person knows they've been rejected but won't accept it.
3. It's imposing. Perhaps they weren't invited for a reason that has nothing to do with them. Perhaps it did have something to do with them. Either way, now the host/coordinator/whoever is put on the spot to explain why they weren't invited when they shouldn't have to defend themselves. Not extending an invite is a boundary they've set.
4. Some gatherings don't operate on an invite system - they're planned informally or in a group chat. If a person isn't in the group chat or informal discussion setting, there's a reason why. If that reason is because the person isn't on a certain platform, that's on them unless someone in the group suggests they reach out to those who aren't in the chat. And if people not in the chat ARE being reached out to, there's a reason this person isn't one of them.

CMV: Twitter's choice to ban all political advertising is a good choice.,2396,262,2019-10-31 09:49:01,"For those unaware, [Twitter recently announced a ban on all political advertising](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50243306) in advance of the 2020 elections.  The ban is worldwide, however, so it's effects will be felt beyond just the USA.

The crux of my argument rests on Dorsey's final note in his statement: 
>This isn’t about free expression. This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today’s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It’s worth stepping back in order to address.

My view is, as the title suggests, that this is the correct action, and should be followed by other social media.  It's worth noting that this policy will affect every side, making GOP outrage that it's ""yet another attempt by the left to silence Trump and conservatives"" (Brad Parscale, manager of President Donald Trump's re-election campaign, quoted in article linked above).  It's exactly this balance, rather than efforts to censor/moderate/fact check said advertisements, that makes me think it's correct.

I know that Reddit, leaning left, will probably generally agree with me on this.  Heaven knows most Dems do.  However, I wanted to provide others with a chance to share their perspectives.  It's possible I'm wrong about something and I'm more than willing to hear it.

E: I put this in a reply somewhere in the thread, and I think it will help focus the discussion a bit more.

>As for why it should be banned, the simple reason is that we don't really understand how far-reaching the effect is on voting habits or political activity.  While it's not the point of this CMV so not a conversation I want to get bogged in, I'd argue that Trump's success, even before getting elected, further encouraged the alt-right, who were already beginning to view the depth of their echo chamber as indicative of how widespread and legitimate their beliefs were.  Now you're giving politicians the ability to pay to reach people they normally wouldn't have.  That seems polarizing to me - exacerbating the lack of political discourse and due diligence in voting, in favor of what others have paid to show you.

CMV: Reddit usernames that contain racial slurs should be banned.,2378,749,2019-07-24 10:00:19,"Warning: I use racial slurs in the explanation of my argument.

I'm black and the use of ""nigger"" on reddit makes me uncomfortable for obvious reasons. Hard ""r"" is objectively a racist term and is only used to make black people feel attacked/unsafe/unwelcome. But I'm also uncomfortable with how popular use of the word ""nigga"" has become among what is a [primarily white user base](https://www.journalism.org/2016/02/25/reddit-news-users-more-likely-to-be-male-young-and-digital-in-their-news-preferences/). People don't necessarily use it in ways to make black people feel bad but they often use it for shock value, to troll, or because they think it's edgy/fun/forbidden. To me, it really ignores the history of the term and is super disrespectful to black people on reddit that have said they find it offensive. I'm sure a lot of people have a black friend that has given them the ""nigga pass"" but -- if you ask that black friend -- they would definitely tell you that the nigga pass is not transferrable. Just because you got it from one person doesn't mean you have it from all black people. It is entirely fair for some black people to be offended by non-black people saying ""nigga"" and for some others not to care. (This isn't a CMV about that.

Since it's not a place where people of color can always feel welcome, since its a place where some amount of people (not everyone, obviously) go out of their way to harass black people simply for being black on the internet, it makes me uncomfortable that so many people are just throwing around the term on here like it doesn't mean anything. One of the reasons why I have no emotional reaction to black people using ""nigga"" is because I know they don't hate me because of the color of my skin. They don't think I'm dumb or violent because of my skin. They don't think that I deserve less because I'm black. I don't know that with people on reddit and every time I see ""nigga"" in a username or a comment is a small reminder of that, of the fact that -- if I mentioned this one small detail about my identity -- I'd get a bunch of threatening harassing messages on a place that should be fun for me to hang out and look at dumb shit.

Reddit has started making an effort to curb the use of ""nigga"" on the site in ways that don't feature any overt racial animus. (r/WaterNiggas comes to mind.) I believe this should extend to usernames. If there's a way to allow affected users to change their names instead of deleting their accounts, that would obviously be preferable. But, if that's not possible, I think the accounts should be deleted. Again, I don't necessarily think that everyone with ""nigga"" in their username is a bad person. But that word affects a lot of people in a pretty negative way and we should respect the history and power of that word. You may have an argument to make about the changing nature of that word. (I'd disagree but there's an argument.) But, to return to the comment I shouted out earlier, there's a difference between being right and being a nice person. Not being able to use the word ""nigga"" in a username should not negatively impact the reddit experience for anyone and it would positively affect the experiences of quite a few.

Thanks for reading and responding. I hope we can keep it civil and productive.

**Edit**: ~~I've got to say that, at this point, this is the first time I've ID'd myself as black on reddit and haven't been hit with a bunch of racist messages. (As of 11:29PM Eastern on 7/23.) I don't know if that's because people on CMV are cool or if it's because this isn't a super popular post or both but it's cool nonetheless.~~ That being said, I've got to get some sleep but I'll hop back on tomorrow. I will say, though, that a lot of the argument has been about whether or not ""nigga"" is offensive and not about the point I made that reddit has started quarantining/banning subs with ""nigga"" in the title and they should similarly ban account with ""nigga"" or other slurs in the name. I hope I'm not coming off as not being able to change my mind. I'm trying to be as open as possible.

**Edit 2:** Okay, I know I said I was logging off an hour ago but I came back on to respond to a couple more people. *Now* I'm logging off. If you can, please avoid making more ""What about this word?"" arguments. For starters, it's already been made like twenty times in the comments below but, on top of that, I don't know if they really address the issue at hand. I'm enjoying the chat, though. I hope you find it interesting, too.

**Edit 3:** Holy crap, this blew up overnight. For starters, we can nix that whole ""Cool, I didn't get any racist harassment"" thing. I got less than usual, but a couple of classy fellas felt the need to remind me that I'm a nigger overnight. Second, I'm definitely not going to be able to respond to everyone but I'll try to hang out for a bit and see if there are any deltas to give out. I'm starting with the bottom since top-level comments have already gotten quite a lot of attention.

**Final Edit:** Thanks to all of you that replied. This seems like it's starting to snowball and I'm getting 10+ notifications every time I refresh. There's no way for me to keep up with everyone but I'll post a quick rundown here:

* There have been a lot of ""what if"" hypothetical responses that have strayed away from the main point. Reddit doesn't allow these words in the titles of subs and that should extend to usernames, too. 
* We've talked a lot about the slippery slope, which is not inherently fallacious, but I believe that it has been used in a fallacious way pretty frequently. A lot of the ""logical consequences"" of banning nigger/nigga in usernames that are being discussed are actually not all that logical nor do they address the point of this CMV. I'm not talking about the legitimate gripe that some people have with the word ""Eskimo."" That's a different discussion.
* I gave a delta (that was removed for some reason) to u/scottcmu's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/ch1vzr/cmv_reddit_usernames_that_contain_racial_slurs/euoj47e/) saying that, though I find it problematic, I think the suggestion that reddit create a feature that automatically hides usernames featuring slurs that individuals find offensive is a viable solution that is different from my original proposal.

I'll try to keep commenting throughout the day but it's pretty overwhelming at this point. Again, thanks to all of you for (for the most part) engaging with this CMV in a productive way. And, if you're someone who insisted on taking time out of your day/night to message me calling me a nigger or to tell me in the comments to ""stfu you dumb nigger"" ... I don't know. Think about your life decisions.",1
CMV: If abortion is a sin then being soldier willingly while invading another country should also be considered a sin.,2373,452,2019-07-02 19:56:51,"Some people believe that abortion is a sin but it  is ok to be a soldier and invade other countries but I disagree for the following reasons

1)If  abortion is sin because it is wrong to intentionally harm or take the life of another human, being a soldier who invades another country is no different because in that case a soldier is paid to intentionally kill other people.

2) Nearly all legal abortions happen when a fetus is attached by the placenta and umbilical cord to the mother and at a time when it has no  the nervous system with the capacity to receive pain or to have feelings so it won't feel any pain.

But the people who might killed by the soldiers , are going to feel intense pain and they are going to suffer both physical and emotionally as they are watching other people die, they may suffer from PTSD even if they survive.

3) The people who might killed by the soldier, may have families friends, wives, husbands and people who care about them,  but   the fetus hasn't form real relationships yet( it's mother may love it, but they haven't form an actual relationship, but even so it is her choice anyway so this isn't going to hurt her and she consider it the most painful choice)

4) Someone may claim that soldiers may go to invade ( or to fight) in another country because this is beneficial for their country. But abortion is also beneficial because it prevents kids from growing up in bad conditions or parents who aren't ready or mature to have kids, therefore the country will have better individuals in the future.

&#x200B;

Btw I am not saying that these things are bad, I am just saying if the abortion is wrong then being a soldier who invades another country is also wrong. But I believe that both are ok in some cases.


EDIT: Thank you for all your comments, you helped me to expand my view and to understand that sometimes it might be necessary to fight a specific group of people by invading their country if for example they are Nazis or jihadists and therefore you do it to protect the lifes of innocent people(although sometimes they also kill innocent people like kids or they lie about their motives  , but that's a conversation for another time).",1
CMV: All presidential campaigns should be government funded.,2375,576,2019-12-19 15:41:13,"Presidential campaigns should be government funded, and all candidates should receive an equal amount of money. That way we eliminate 2 problems:

1) Corporate donors, special interests group, bribery, lobbying, etc. No one will owe anyone favors.

2) Everyone is on a level playing field. In almost every case, the candidate that raises the most money ends up winning. This is an unfair advantage. [Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/04/04/think-money-doesnt-matter-in-elections-this-chart-says-youre-wrong/)",1
"CMV: If you believe that transgender women have an advantage over XX women in competitive sports, it is not transphobic to suggest they be excluded.",2371,721,2019-05-16 06:31:42,"Hi, this is in regards to the controversy surrounding a youtuber named Rationality Rules. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50Iok5At7Hw&t=2s) is the video that stirred the controversy and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX5buM7kRbU) is a video that I believe does an excellent job at explaining the problems with it. I don't think watching these videos are required to change my view, but if you want to understand where I am coming from - here it is.

First off, I have the following opinions

* The rights of transgender women should be the same as women
* Therefore, the default for Transgender Women in ""women's sports"" should be inclusion
* In competitive sports, fairness is important above all (and this is the justification behind the banning of steroids, for example)
*  Based on the arguments in the original Essence of Thought [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE7chPseZKY&t=1s), I believe the only valid evidence is to compare Transgender women on Hormone Replacement Therapy(HRT) to XX Women and that constitutes the basis for Rationality Rules' video(where he uses studies comparing XX biology to XY biology) being INCORRECT pending better evidence.
* It is not okay that Rationality rules had a quote in his original video that called a transgender women a man. That is not okay.

Rationality rules' video has been called transphobic because it calls a transgender woman a man. I will grant this.

Another complaint is that he dehumanizes two transgender female athletes by suggesting their success in running (placing in the top 8 above another runner) is due to their XY biology and suggesting a XX runner who placed outside of the top 8 lost her dreams because of this. My understanding of the dehumanization argument here is that the XY female runners have dreams too and making it seem like they are bad and that their success is a bad thing/not due to fair play is dehumanizing. I think this is a fair criticism that I would not like to deal with at length.

The complaint I would like to focus on is that Rationality rules is arguing to strip transgender women of their rights. In effect, I am buying that RR actually believes that transgender women have an advantage(despite being wrong). I think in this case, fairness in sport trumps fairness in human rights.

The reason I would like my view changed is that it RR's video has been called transphobic and those who support the video or do not see it as fully transphobic are considered not to be allies of LGBTQ.[ For example](https://twitter.com/83LOKI/status/1128261601021386752). I would like to be an ally, and it appears that my general support of RR is at odds with this and/or my opinion that **IF** you believe XY women have a competitive advantage in sports compared to XX women, **THEN** it is not transphobic to argue for their exclusion or restriction.

> EDIT: The CMV has been changed to be more clear about my intention. It is now

If you believe **evidence shows** that transgender women ahve an advantage over XX women in competitive sports, it is not transphobic to suggest they be excluded.


# **Final Edit**

My view has been changed. Basically, I now believe you can be unintentionally or ignorantly transphobic - having evidence to back you up isn't enough if you are wrong. The way I was led to this conclusion was by considering matters of racism - you can have evidence to back up racist opinions just fine but they are still racist.

[Here is a link to the conclusion of the comment thread that changed my view if you would like the read, I think the commenter is very persuasive](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/bp4m02/cmv_if_you_believe_that_transgender_women_have_an/ensiwbc/?context=10000)",1
CMV: The lack of conservative outcry towards Donald Trump will ultimately severely undermine future legitimate conservative candidates.,2369,702,2018-07-25 23:33:52,"I believe and know many conservative individuals, representatives and officials who privately strongly disagree with the current administration. However their inability to speak out against the administration (which as far as I can tell does not hold conservative values) speaks to their desire for holding office and holding partisanship over doing what is best for the country. I believe this is mostly done for political reasons despite the administration contradicting many of the traditional conservative values such as responsibe fiscal management, free trade, strength against US adversaries, ethical treatment of others, acting in a professional manner. This has ultimately undermined the sincerity and legitimacy of their arguments and will make them unelectable (by sincere conservative voters) in the future. Further the conservative brand has become so heavily tarnished that it will become near impossible in the near future to have a legitimate conservative leader who is not saddled with the legacy of this administration.",1

"CMV: Americans should stop using the term ""hero"" to describe those who enlist in the military.",2362,381,2016-06-29 11:37:58,"As an American, I find it common that the phrase ""hero"" is something used a lot to describe those who enlist in the military. I find that although there are definitely some troops who do heroic things, we should not simply throw the term ""hero"" around as some sort of umbrella term for those who enlist.

Obviously, there are some circumstances in which a soldier does something ""heroic"" and worthy of praise. I would say throwing yourself on a grenade to protect the others around you is definitely worthy of the term. However, there are many who enlist that never see a day of physical combat in their lives. To use the term ""hero"" to describe all people who serve is detracting from the accomplishments of those who really deserve it.

Also, using a word with such a powerful, positive connotation for all those of a particular profession is a bad idea because, although it's not fun to think about, some troops are just bad people. Enlisting doesn't give you a clean slate and a pure soul. Just like every other profession, those who are in the military are capable of doing both bad and good things. For example, there have been many cases of sexual assault within the institution. To say/act as if those who serve are immediately heroic individuals is to erase the crimes committed by these individuals as well as the experiences of the victims.

Immediately assuming someone who has enlisted is worthy of such a title is toxic, as it perpetuates the idea that these individuals are somehow ""above"" the normal citizen, and that they are incapable of making mistakes and/or immoral decisions. It makes it seem at though someone who has served is more than what they are, a human being capable of both right and wrong.",1
CMV: There is no defending the Last Jedi's plot and writing,2355,1034,2019-08-21 15:03:02,"Let me start off by saying The Last Jedi (TLJ) has some redeemable aspects. The CGI was completely top class, and the visual effects were incredible. Also, some of the action was good and the humor was at times good.

The first issue I will raise is involving the light speed maneuver. This forever changes the Star Wars space battles as it completely disregards previously established lore that light speed is in another dimension in which you travel faster. From now on, every space battle in a Star Wars movie people will be expecting either faction in the conflict to employ this strategy. This scene also disregards every previous space battle in the saga's history, as this surely would have been used before, if not only as a kamikaze attempt. In the next movie, the creative team will probably have to create some contrived 'hyper-shield' to stop this from happening again. This is a perfect example of style of substance. Edit: I now have been informed that large structures have a ‘shadow mass’ in hyperspace. The main problem presented in this point should now be about how this has never been used before.

In addition, half the plot is completely contrived. From the moment Laura Dern's character comes in and is secretive to Poe (who is known to be completely loyal but also hot-headed and prone to solving problems himself) it causes half the plot to happen. There is no reason for Dern's character to do this, and considering half the Resistance's leadership just died he may be one of the most appropriate people to tell. Half the point of this is probably to kick-start Finn and Roses adventure to Space Vegas, which was a whole completely useless subplot.

Furthermore, Rian Jhonson and the creative team completely disregarded the previous film in order to have the protagonists be underdogs. There is no reason for the Republic funded resistance to having this little of a fleet. This is partially the fault of The Force Awakens for a lack of initial world-building but there is no reason for the previously victorious rebels to be down to 9 useless bombers, a few X-Wings, 1 cruiser, and 3 medical friggets. Given this takes place immediately after the events of TFA there is no way a comic or TV show explains this.

The Space Vegas portion of the film is completely cringe-worthy. The obvious anti-capitalism theme is ironic, considering that this trilogy seems to more and more be looking like and unplanned cash-grab from the corporate enterprise that is Disney. This entire scene could have been cut for more world-building if Maz was available to be the master code-breaker and was not just in the film for 30 seconds to meet a diversity quota.

The movie completely destroys Luke's character. The man who converted the evilest man ever to the light side was always hopeful and optimistic would not try and kill his sister and best friends child, who was just a boy. He is shown as a grumpy, miserable old fart. The sadness on Mark Hamill's face during interviews regarding this film is telling. My favorite part of the movie is when Luke walks out of the rebel base alone and faces the army of AT-ATs alone, but this is ruined by him making a brushing the shoulders gesture, which is completely out of character for him.

Rey is also a complete Mary Sue. Her power would be understandable if she was the daughter of someone relevant like maybe Palpatine, Kenobi, or maybe even Luke but she is 'nothing'. She faces no challenges and has no relatable character flaws unless being bored with being too strong is one. She pilots the Falcon better than Han, she is the strongest force user ever (Luke even says so) and can beat Kylo in a duel.

The First Order is also portrayed as incompetent and amateur in this film, in particular, General Hux. Their actions in the space chase make no sense. General Hux, who was previously intimidating and one of the few snew trilogy characters I like is played for slapstick and laughs. Kylo goes from being menacing to an angsty teenager in minutes. If the reason for half your plot is the antagonists are incompetent or dumb, your movie is badly written.

The final issue I'll raise in this main body of the text is how the film had about 0 original ideas. Yes, there were one or two vaguely new ones but it's undeniable that a lot of this film was cut and pasted from episode 5 and 6. The new trilogy is obviously trying to show they were more like the originals.

I will also clarify that at points the film was enjoyable somewhat, but that doesn't mean it is any better, so if someone could explain these major fundamental flaws in this movie then I could change my view. So far people have just said 'well I enjoyed it', which seems to be based upon all the fan service.

CMV: tipping leads to worse service,2354,785,2019-12-07 20:24:27,"I'm from an European country but have also lived in US for a few years. I'm not going to argue whether tips make sense as a practice or economically, just how they effect the quality of service. 

It is commonly believed that US waitstaff goes out of their way because of the incentive that is the tips, but here I will argue that this actually only makes things worse for the customer. Here is what tipping leads to:


1. Overbearing service. From fake cheerfulness to constantly having them at your table, it's just way too much. Realistically there just isnt that much that a regular waiter can do aside from taking your orders, and as long as they are polite and not slow, the service is good. If you try going ""above and beyond"" you actually end up harassing customers. In Europe the staff leaves the table alone until called. 

2. Rushing the guests - another negative side effect of having staff constantly at your table is that your pace is dictated by staff who want to clear the table for the next tipping customer. I on the other hand enjoy the relaxed atmosphere of European restaurants where you can take all the time in the world to uninterruptedtly talk and enjoy your drinks or meal at any pace 

3. Lack of sincerity - among the customers are introverts who like to be left alone and extroverts who like to chitchat and connect with the waiter. Neither profits from fake/money-based friendliness of an US waiter. You dont actually know if they like you as a person and you suspect no one is that enthusiastic to serve you. In Europe, wait staff isn't over the top and treats you like person to person, but when you instigate small talk and get along you know its genuine.


4. Putting ""value"" on the customer - for a system that prides itself with great service, I find US waitstaff quite rude and exploitative if you're a customer who doesnt intend to spend too much. In Europe you can gather some coins, walk to a pub or a coffee shop, ask for the cheapest something and then sit over it for as long as youd like. In US this is considered wasting your waiters time and it wasnt until I learned about the mentality later that I could explain why I got such weird reception after saying this. I also find it rude that if the client can tip only within the lower end of norm, they are also considered or treated as assholes and many Americans think these people should not go out at all. At least in Europe you never meet this sentiment and you can be a cheap customer without any negativity (the main reason why US staff hates cheap customers is also that cheap food means low tip even if you calculate the good percentage). Its sad that poor people are seen as wasting time and space if they want to go out, by same servers who expect customers to care about their financial situation 


For all these reasons I think service is better when it doesnt directly financially depend on each individual customer but when servers can instead just focus on doing their job. If the service is really bad which can happen in both systems, customers can still complain to the management or not come back at all. Providing good service is still part of a job description and like any other profession, being bad at your work can still get you fired put you in a bad spot with your boss. Customer experience is better when they arent seen as a dollar sign.",1
CMV that kids should not have to ask the teacher to use the bathroom.,2358,391,2019-08-09 22:35:51,"Kids shouldn't have to ask teachers to use the bathroom for a few reasons. I think the rule is stupid because the teacher has no idea how much a kid has to go. They have no right to force kids to go ask their permission, the kid should just be able to leave. Will some kids leave and go Juul or go on the phone in the bathroom? Yes, some kids definitely would, but they do that already with the current system and skipping class is only really hurting themselves anyway. Also, if a kid is gone for too long then obviously someone should look for them.  I just can't see a reason for this system. It kind of treats students like prisoners, and I understand why we do it with prisoners, but why with kids? It's unnecessary and wastes both the teacher and the student's time by doing so.

CMV: you can refuse to accept someone's identity and still treat them with respect and believe they should have human rights,2351,981,2019-09-21 21:49:33,"(so big mistake rather than ""accept"" i meant ""believe"" meaning ""**you can refuse to believe someone's identity** **and still treat them with respect and believe they should have human rights**"" because accept implies coming to terms with someone/something and if you can't come to terms with someone's identity then you probably can't respect them)

first things first i believe transgenderism and non binary is a thing and believe being born in the wrong body is a real issue and transitioning is (so far anyway) the best method for fixing it. just felt like it was (unfortunately) important to make my position on this clear when it really shouldn't be imo especially in this subreddit

i been getting a sentiment for a while where if you don't accept someone's self identity you simply do not respect or feel they deserve basic human rights

needless to say its mostly from leftist and/or lgbt+ community but might have other people too i think

i have been getting it from when ever left or lgbt says transgender people are being denied their human rights they almost always point to someone who believes there are 2 genders or transgenderism doesn't exist and somehow that means people who identify as non binary or are transgender they are literally not human and don't deserve respect or human rights. for starters i don't thing being accepted as what you identify as is a human right, its only a violation of human rights when humans rights as we know are being violated, in other words you identifying as say some animal and other people not accepting that identity isn't a violation of rights, its only when people start treating you with the same contempt as an animal.

that brings me to the respect part, i also believe that you can treat someone with full respect as everyone else but still not be on board with what they identify with because i honestly don't see why not.

edit: again let me stress this enough DELIBERATELY USING ""he/him"" ON SOMEONE WHO POLITELY ASKED TO BE CALLED WITH ""she/her"" IS DISRESPECTFUL. why? because its not your business to try anything other than basic respect for a random person, sure if she was someone closed to you might strike up a conversation about it but if its some random person all you can really do is remember the pronouns that he/she wanted to be addressed by. now if you can't remember that's fine but atleast you are trying and that's respectful. the main point is to just get by the daily lives of you and that person and anything that gets in the way is just no good for either person

consider someone who thinks he's a alien and he's not and goes to a therapist for help, how is the therapist is going to help/address that person's problems? will he straight up say it to his face he's not a alien? or will he say he is what he is and leave it at that? no he's going to respectfully say you are a good and sane person (which he is with the exception of identifying with a alien) but you are just mistaken on your identity and ask him how he got there in identifying as a alien. if a therapist can be respectful with someone who identifies with something they are not why can't your average joe? that's what i wanna know.

edit: obligatory ""HOLY SHET this blew up overnight! i would try to reply to as many comments as i can but im afraid i will not be able to reply to everyone out of the 800+ comments"" now that is out of the way...

lets clear up some misconceptions and answer some of the most asked questions:

""its disrespectful to indulge in someone's delusion""

then what is the alternative in trying to be respectful? tell them straight they are not what they perceive themselves as? or strike up a conversation about it right then and there regardless of the time or the place? or there's something else im not getting?

""its disrespectful to not believe in someone's identity""

then what are you supposed to do to respect them? genuinely believe them right then and there from deep within? or like the above halt everything you are doing and discuss it with them or use your own time to research it and change your mind on it just to respect them? if that's the case then frankly that's asking for a bit too much for basic respect imho but feel free to cmv even on this

(note im not very good when it comes to making up post so maybe there are some grammer issues here and there and some points left out so just bear with me)

Delta 1:  even thought it may not look like it i had the assumption that respect is a conscious effort, meaning you can always respect someone as long as you want however that is not the case because you can unintentionally disrespect someone as well however i don't think that is too big of a change because you are bound to disrespect someone one way or the other regardless of what you do

Delta 2: given to the person who made me realize i been using ""accept"" the wrong way

delta 3: i believed how you came to think of a certain group has no bearing on you respecting them whatsoever but someone made me realize if you believed something negative about a certain group just by reading only a few articles instead of being a little skeptical it would mean you didn't hold them to much respect because we tend to not regard the feelings or rights of people we are quick to judge i think

FINAL EDIT: phew lots of good points across the board but i think my view and the way i've presented was both a mess because first i think i been conflating everyday respect with genuine respect for a person. and the way i've presented also gave people the idea that i believe refusing to accept - that is - refusing to come to terms with a person is somehow respectful so i think ill call it quits now. this is only my 2nd reddit thread anyway out of the years of lurking around so i was prepared for a bit of mess but maybe this topic just got out of my hand",1
"CMV: Those born in poor economic backgrounds, or in bad circumstances shouldn't be expected to act better than everyone else, and ""pull themselves by their bootstraps.""",2343,1308,2019-07-25 06:32:15,"With the increasing amount of Republican action because of President Trump, a lot of programs that serve to help the lower class are in danger. Additonally, many from higher classes have opposed to help those in the lower class, state that they should ""pull themselves from their bootstraps"", when it's a fuck ton harder to do just that.  Many born in worst circumstances, do worse overall in life. Whether academically, socially, or emotionally. Goverment assitance should not be eliminated for these people. Furthermore, they shouldn't be looked down upon socially. A lot of people in the poor class, face more barriers than those in the upper class. For instance, they shouldn't be shamed for not being able to reach a high-caliber job, when they are struggling to be able to sustain themselves in the first place. Many in the upper or middle class don't have that isssue, and obtaining a job like that isn't nearly impossible.

Edit: I apologize in advance for my vague post. I didn't think this would gain so much attention and trigger so much people (anecdotes aren't real evidence). First off, one of my points is that the negative stigma surrounding poor people is not only unjust, but it's also not true. In the US, it's seen as their fault that they continue to be poor, when that's simply not the case. Many who are poor were born poor to begin with, and it's not fair to make them work more than one dead end job to pay basic necessities. Telling them it's their fault, when most jobs they have access to don't pay a living wage. It's not as simple as ""get a job"". Additonally, college degrees are a necessity nowadays, and if you were born poor, you'd have to worry about so many other things than just studying. This can affect your overall performance, which affects your chances of getting into a good college, or staying in the first place. Overall, some people are born with more challenges from the start. Yes, it's not impossible to climb out of the poor class, but it's highly improbable. Expecting that from everyone in the poor class, is just unjust, and unrealistic. You can only work for so long before it wears you down. Therefore, they should not be expected to act better than everyone else, and ""pull themeslves by their bootstraps"".",1
CMV: Liberal news sources have lost a lot of credibility because of the way they have reported on the Muller investigation,2341,533,2019-03-26 02:02:39,"For context, I am a registered Democrat and consider myself a very liberal person. I think that Trump is a disgrace to the presidency, and I think that they way he has deemed all news that speaks badly of him “fake news” is extremely dangerous. 

However, it seems to me that CNN, MSNBC, etc have shot themselves in the foot by devoting so much time to the Muller investigation over the past two years, and by reporting on it as if they were 100% certain that the investigation would lead to clear collusion and/or obstruction charges against Trump. 

I think that a lot of people, including myself, felt like these news sources laid out a clear path to a Trump impeachment as soon as Muller finished his investigation, and that Trump/Fox News would end up making fools of themselves for calling the whole thing a “witch hunt.” However, it seems like the opposite has happened. Even when the full report comes out, I don’t see how this could be anything except for a huge win for Trump. 

I’ve always been skeptical of news sources and attempted to fact check anything I read. Someone please convince me that Fox News isn’t right in saying that I was blinded by my hatred for Trump when I believed everyone who was saying this investigation would be a bombshell against Trump. 

Edit: woah that’s my first gold, thanks stranger! 

***IMPORTANT EDIT: this really blew up, and it was brought to my attention that people are using this as evidence of liberals becoming pro-trump or something along those lines. So if people are quoting this post, please include this: I STILL DONT LIKE TRUMP. AT ALL. Regardless of my trust in liberal media, I STRONGLY disagree with almost everything Trump says, does, and stands for. It is insanely hypocritical to look at this post and say, “see, Fox News was telling the truth the whole time.” If you are agreeing with my criticism of CNN and MSNBC, you should be equally if not more outraged by Fox News. Thanks. ",1
CMV: The way Reddit handled the recent ban wave was extremely unjust and in bad faith.,2342,906,2020-07-01 12:07:27,"I'm not arguing over who should have been banned or whether or not Reddit should engage in censorship.  That's a separate issue. Reddit wants to censor... fine.  But the way they did it was completely unfair.  As far as I understand, they felt the old set of rules wasn't good enough and decided to update them to better weed out the subreddits they felt didn't fit the spirit of their site and/or they wanted to take the site in a different direction (if I am way off base about this, please let me know).  Fine again.  Now if a subreddit was already breaking the old rules, but hadn't been caught yet, perfectly fair to ban them outright.  But many of them (I would guess most) were in good standing with the old policies, and when the policies changed, they got immediately banned.  That's completely unfair.  They had followed the rules Reddit made for them, and then got banned because reddit decided their own rules weren't good enough.  It's not the sub's fault the Reddit team didn't come up with a good enough set of rules the first time, or decided to update them.

Basically, Reddit initially made some rules. The subs and their mods followed and enforced them in good faith.  Then reddit decided they want better/new rules.  But if in the past a sub was found to have broken the new rules, despite having always faithfully followed the rules they had been given at the time, Reddit banned the sub without warning.  How is that reasonable?  Again, if the sub was found to have violated the old rules, no problem, ban them.  They knew the rules and violated them.  Perfectly fair.  But subs that were in good standing at the time of the rule change should have been given a month or something (or whatever time frame is fair), to clean themselves up and meet the new policies.  If after a month they still weren't in good standing, then you ban them.  But permanently punishing subs in good standing for violating rules that didn't exist yet is insane and tyrannical.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  To those of you who discussed genuinely, thank you.  You were the minority, and sifting through the ""You have a view I disagree with ergo you must be an asshole and a Trump supporter""  (asshole is subjective, and I don't like Trump) replies to get to your answers was quite tedious. I don't know why Trump kept coming up, but lot of people here are way too obsessed with him, and are clearly not interested in having their views changed, or even changing the views of others; just pointing out what idiots anyone who has a thought they don't hold are. This post had nothing to do with him or any other politicians, or really anything that wasn't related to reddit's latest bans.

It looks like my initial premise was not accurate, and the situation I highlighted was likely exceptional.  Apparently there were some warnings about the rule changes, which were not drastic anyway.  Plus most banned subs, were due to inactivity.  I wouldn't go so far as to saying my view was completely changed, but good points were brought to my attention, and I would agree that the situation was not as poorly handled as I initially thought.  Maybe Reddit could have done a better job about making sure everyone understood what happened, as it seems like a lot of people were surprised by the house cleaning, but I've never run a giant social media platform, so what the hell do I know.  

Thanks to those of you who (civilly) brought these points to my attention.  There are hundreds of comments already, so I'm sorry if I missed some and you didn't get that coveted delta.  Many of you were wondering/assuming I made this post because some sub of mine got banned.  Only one that I frequented was banned, r/badacademy, which was about examples of bad academic practices, and from what I understand it got banned for something unrelated to mistreatment of other people. I liked the sub so it's too bad... but it ranks pretty low on my list of priorities and my disappointment lasted maybe half an hour.",1
"CMV: The biggest motivator of school shootings, is that the media gives the perpetrator the attention they want. If nobody knew who the shooter was, there would be less incentive to commit these acts.",2333,337,2018-05-30 16:02:53,"I would like to engage with you all and discuss the main motivators of school shootings. Hear me out as to why I believe this is the main motivator of shooters.

We live in a world where fame is highly sought after. We often look up to celebrities and other famous people for all types of life advice and/or follow what they do. How many people do you know, or knew of, that ""being famous"" was one of their main aspirations in life?

I understand not everybody is the same, but most people can attest to the fact that being famous and known is extremely sought after by A LOT of folks. Let me give you an example:

**Who shot up Sandy Hook elementary school?**

**Case in point.**

Everybody knows the name Adam Lanza. If we didn't publish his name, nobody would know who Adam Lanza was.

Traits of Narcissism can be a highly-inflated self worth, disregard of others feelings, and wanting to be admired. I believe most mass shooters are narcissists.

In my honest opinion, this is what drives people to commit these acts. It's easy fame. 

You can go through your whole life being an outstanding member of society, and you will most likely have your name only known in your family. You can work hard, and be a doctor, a lawyer, a brilliant engineer. But at the end of the day, there are millions of others out there that are doctors and lawyers as well. In order to be well known, you would have to stand out. Some people strive to achieve fame in their life.

Hear me out: What is easier, purchasing a couple of guns and shooting up a school, or working your ass off for decades for fame and admiration that may not even come with all the hard work you have put in?

I am by NO means trying to invalidate the other problems such as bullying, social rejection and mental illness. But I believe those issues at most, make up half, or less than half of the reason that these people commit these violent acts.

Few Examples:

* In a police interview, Martin Bryant was uncontrollably excited when he saw his name plastered all over the news.

* Timothy McVeigh was looking at a list of 'Most evil people in history' that was voted on by the public, and he was bragging about how he was ranked 21 or something, just behind Vlad the Impaler who in his words ""IDK who that is but his name sounds cool""

These people get off on the rush at the thought that everybody knows who they are, and the fact everybody hates them.

Stopping the publishing of the perpetrators names would help curb the majority of heinous acts. There would still be people out there that do it regardless, but there is a lot less incentive. I believe either a new legislate that prohibits the publication of names could help solve one of the biggest problems that face the United States today.

CMV: Having sexual preferences excluding transgender people is not transphobic,2337,1221,2017-11-02 09:12:46,"Arguing that holding sexual preferences specifically excluding transgender people is transphobic is to conflate characteristics one finds sexually valuable with those one deems of holistic value—that is, the worth of a human relative to others. Obviously, belief that transgender people have less worth than cisgender people is transphobic; doing so would use trans-status as a surrogate for holistic value. However, sexual preferences—a set of characteristics which indicate sexual value to a person—do not equate holistic value judgements. Given the distinction between a characteristic indicating sexual value and holistic value to a person, sexual preference as it relates to trans-status is not transphobic.

Note: I am interpreting “transphobic” to mean having or showing the belief that transgender people have lesser holistic value. Admittedly, this definition lacks nuance.",1
CMV: Britain is royally screwed.,2331,992,2016-06-24 16:50:55,"I voted remain. I have just woken up to the Leave victory. My concern is that today the pound has dropped 13% in value. We have no other trade agreements outside of the EU, meaning we will likely still have to trade with the EU under EU regulations. We haven't lost dependence on the EU but we have lost our say in those events. Cameron (who I'm not a fan of) has stepped down, meaning we could potentially end up with the second unelected prime minister in my lifetime. I'm very worried right now and would appreciate some help to see the bright side of this, preferably about some issue other than immigration because I feel that the issue has been so inflated into fearmongering that it's not likely to feel reassuring.

I've been researching the referendum for a while and my understanding of the subject is that a lot of people have chosen to vote leave because we were promised a) tighter immigration and b) money set aside for our priorities, e.g. the NHS. Immigration I don't think is being dealt with well since it's been presented as racism vs overidealism. The NHS funding promise was U-turned this morning within minutes of the results. It feels a little like the public have been misled, fearmongered and undereducated on the issue against their best interests.

CMV: Reddit should hide the scores of posts until the user has voted for themselves.,2331,141,2015-11-18 10:59:02,"There's no denying this site has a problem with hive-mind mentality. The voting system naturally censors unpopular viewpoints, but I believe seeing the current score before voting for yourself compromises the integrity of the individual vote, leading to more of a band wagon response. Waiting to reveal the current score until after the individual user has cast his would also prompt users to vote more often. This is good because those votes would naturally push the content in a direction that the users appreciate.
To reiterate (and for easy rebuttal):
1. The votes would become more honest
2. The votes would become more frequent.

CMV: Donald Trump's blatant use of his position to promote the businesses of himself and his family/punish those that go against is unethical and should be an impeachable offense.,2330,509,2017-02-09 22:05:54,"In the wake of Trump's tweets (retweeted by the OFFICIAL POTUS account) attacking Nordstrom for removing Ivanka's line, I am fearful of what appears to be the start of something like neopotism in the highest office of the U.S. Advertising/attacking certain companies equates to choosing who succeeds/fails (look at stock prices after he calls these companies out!) and the Trump families blatant refusal to divest themselves truly from their business amounts to unprecedented conflicts of interest. Worse, it is almost certain that nothing will be done about this by the Republican controlled congress, who seem content to let Trump be Trump as long as he allows them the chance to advance their party platform. It is my opinion that this SHOULD BE an impeachable offense, as it, first of all, shows that his interest in the presidency is significantly guided by Trump business ventures, and further, begins a worrying trend of putting companies at risk for going against him. Other companies could choose not to drop Trump businesses now, for fear of retaliation. We also have the L.L. Bean twitter advertisement by Trump to look at as an example of him rewarding donors and supporters. 

So yeah. Change my view.

CMV: Salaries should be an open discussion in workplaces,2327,369,2018-08-24 02:51:09,"Often employers discourage or straight up forbid employees from discussing salaries and wages. I've worked at places that threaten termination if is discussed. I'm not sure about the legality of not allowing employees to discuss salaries, but I do know that is generally frowned upon. Even though most people are at a job to make money, the topic of money at that job seems to be taboo. Personally I'd be interested in what others make to gauge what I ""deserve.""

To me, this seems like a disadvantage to the workers. By discussing your salary openly with coworkers, you can negotiate your pay competitively when it comes time to discuss an opportunity for a raise. I understand why employers discourage this practice, but I do not understand why everyone follows this practice. I think the norm should consist of open conversations regarding salary conversations. I would love to hear from someone who could explain to me why the practice of not discussing your salary with coworkers is beneficial for the employee. 

Edit: So I’m going to respond to everyone but this escalated a bit quicker than I anticipated. I appreciate all the great arguments and points being made though!

CMV: Antivaxxers should be legally responsible for any harm that directly comes to their child,2326,327,2018-06-14 18:06:21,"You hear all the time in r/insanepeoplefacebook about people wanting help caring with their sick child but without vaccines, I didn't care until I saw a recent post about a child being heavily disabled (unable to talk) and having *no grey matter* in their brain at all. This is because the child's parent (couldn't tell if it was the mother or father) refused vaccines.

This full grown adult has possibly caused permanent damage to an infant and I certainly haven't heard any reports of arrests for child abuse. Depending on severity, this could go all the way up to manslaughter and unless there are stories I haven't read, no repercussions except the loss of a child they didn't deserve and this is still allowed.

Doctors should make vaccines mandatory for certain cases in which the child's life could be in danger and the government should pay for it because these people are killing their child. This case with the babies brain being 100% white matter due to no vaccines is just awful.

TL;DR: The government should pay for life saving vaccines and these vaccines should be mandatory, no opting out unless the obvious allergic reaction or other medical problems.

EDIT: The child I mention was actually in his condition due to a refusal of a *vitamin supplement* not a vaccine though I feel the same logic should apply, sorry for the mistake.",1
CMV: Outrage at every perceived injustice provides a 'smokescreen' for greater injustices to sneak through,2320,352,2019-07-01 18:05:15,"Let's pretend that a morally reprehensible act could be quantified. Something like calling someone a mean name might be a 5 whereas sustained verbal and physical abuse might clock in at 50. **The numbers are arbitrary and I'm only using them to make my point easier to understand.**

I'm going to use the easy example of Trump. Let's suppose he says or does something that is a 10. The media goes nuts. Everyone and their mother is talking about it by the following day. This continues to happen regularly with numbers ranging from 5-15. These are all clear-cut examples of reprehensible behavior and understandably cause anger.

Until he does something that's a 100. The kind of careless decision that harms millions of people. The media goes nuts. Everyone and their mother is talking about it by the following day. You see where I'm going with this?

The previous outrages served as a vaccine. Now that the population has reacted like this so many times, the news story plays out much the same way. This true miscarriage of justice has snuck through because we don't have a way of reacting differently. We're already at a fever pitch and stuck there.

I think the way news covers every negative mishap has made it too difficult to be aware of when something really bad is happening. The news feels like a reality show. I have no idea who or what to believe at this point. Actions that would normally end political careers seem to bounce off of Trump. I stopped following the news a long time ago because I couldn't take it any more.

This doesn't just apply to politics and can just as easily be seen in interpersonal interactions. Please show me how reacting to every action that is morally wrong, with outrage, provides good outcomes. Hopefully this bizarre analogy makes sense.",1
CMV: Caller ID spoofing should be made entirely illegal.,2319,178,2017-10-26 01:16:23,"Caller ID spoofing is the practice of transmitting digital information with a phone call representing a number as the dialing number other than that which is actually the dialing number.

I believe this practice should be made entirely illegal, and that either the accurate calling number, or else no number, must be transmitted.

Spoofing is overwhelmingly used by scammers and spammers, and is a major technique of fraud.  While some users have an interest in spoofing which is more legitimate, those interests can generally be accommodated through just blocking caller ID (displaying no number).

Because spoofing is so prevalent in illegal and deceptive activity, and because it is inherently deceptive, and because the legitimate users of the service have a non-deceptive alternative, I believe spoofing should be banned, and that the government should promulgate regulations to telecommunications companies banning the practice entirely.

CMV: Luigi is the superior Mario Brother.,2323,203,2016-07-30 00:42:19,"You heard me. Now's the time to wake up, sheeple. Today, I'm going to peel the wool from your eyes and reveal the truth--that Luigi is the better of the two Mario bros and he deserves our respect, trust, and dignity.

(1) **Luigi is green.** Have you seen that shade of green he rocks? That's some serious green right there. Green is a tranquil color. Green is often used to signify safety, ie 'green means go', or terror alert level green is the safest. Trees. Grass. Cucumbers. Nature. What is the color red? Warning. Stop. Danger. Blood. Communism. Nazism. Absolute chaos. Mario's primary color choice is the embodiment of fear underscored with a tonality of madness. Who's more likely to cut you off, a green station wagon or a red sports car? Point, Luigi.

(2) **As player two, you can see the mistakes player one makes.** Didn't realize there's a hole there? Maybe they missed a block. Hell, maybe they missed a pipe? Those who play Mario just plow along, unabated with interest to their surroundings. Luigi players are more observant. Careful.

(3) **Luigi is quirkier in games.** He can jump higher. He's got a cool headbutt move. He can do everything Mario can, only better. Mario, on the other hand, symbolizes normalcy. There is literally a trope called ""The Mario"", underscoring a character that is, on the whole, average in every conceivable way. Luigi breaks from that mold, finding a new way to stand out without going to great excess.

(4) **Luigi is monogamous.** He has had only one lover in his heart, Princess Daisy. Mario, on the other hand, is an insidious malcontent with a long string of lovers. Sure, you may remember Princess Peach, but what of Pauline? The woman from Donkey Kong? After she was rescued, she had been tossed under the bus outright, a mere pawn for Mario's rescuing-based sexual fetish. Hell, Mario still sees Pauline from time to time, but only of Donkey Kong is involved (and minis, for some reason).  And remember Daisy from earlier? Yeah, she's from the Super Mario Land series on the Game Boy. This means that Mario went from Pauline, to Peach aka Toadstool, to Daisy, then back to Peach! Luckily, Luigi was their to pick up the pieces after Mario broke Daisy's heart and showed her what a real man looked like. That's how it has remained ever since.

(5) **Luigi has the better mustache.** Go ahead and GIS it right now. Compare and contract the different mustaches. Luigi's is a fine affair, torn straight from the pages of yesteryear, invoking that turn-of-the-century ideas of being a strong, stalwart gentleman. Mario's mustache looks like a curtain and invokes that feeling of a seedy bastard leaving a 1970s porno theater.

(6) **Luigi has the better personality.** Strictly speaking, he actually has a personality. He can come off as a bit scared at times, but I remember a quote saying that true bravery is knowing your fear and overcoming it for the sake of a greater good. This is Luigi in a nutshell. He realizes his life is finite, but he knows what is to be done. Mario recklessly strides into the darkest depths of infinity. Mario is not brave. Mario is at the least fool-hearty and at its extremes suicidal!

(7) **Luigi is taller.** I know you are chomping at the bit, ready to call me 'height-ist' or whatever, but hear me out. Even if we can exclude all previously listed elements and all else was constant, we know that Luigi is taller. He can reach a higher shelves. He's got a longer stride. You can call me what you what, but at the end of the day, who are you going to ask to get that jar of pickles from the top shelf?

And I haven't even begin explore all options, here! He is not the Green Mario you make him out to be. Mario is, in fact, the Red Luigi. Now, merely try to CMV.


**EDIT:** I really did not expect this much response to something so trivial. I want to thank you all for your participation today and you are, of course, welcome to argue in my absence.

As for me, Luigi will be my favorite, literally forever. That bitch got me Reddit Gold! That is literally blowing my mind.

However, I do subscribe to the multiverse Luigi theory now, so.. Point somewhat changed?

CMV: It is wrong to mock Trump for physical foibles.,2316,547,2020-06-21 13:16:02,"Tonight at a rally, Trump went on an extended rant about media depictions of his West Point speech a week ago, in particular focused on his very cautious walk down a ramp from the stage, and a moment where he awkwardly drank water using both hands.

It is clear that the incidents, and responses to them, are very personally bothering to Trump.  This CMV post in particular is prompted by [this tweet](https://twitter.com/ToddDomke/status/1274535451890716672) I saw attributing Trump's rant to ads run by PACs mocking him for it.

I think it is wrong to run such ads, or otherwise try to make political hay out of things like this, because we should not mock disabilities or impairments which come from aging.  If there is something physically wrong with Trump such as arthritis that is giving him issues with these tasks, that is not a moral failing and is not something anyone should base their vote on.  

Even discounting Trump's personal feelings, it is cruel and demeaning to people with physical disabilities to mock these sort of things.

There's plenty of things to attack Trump on (I mean, he said that he ordered there to be fewer COVID tests in his speech tonight for fuck's sake).  I don't think mocking him for having trouble with a glass of water should be one of them.",1
CMV: The concept of gender does not serve a useful purpose and Gender Theory only serves to promote tribalism.,2321,466,2018-10-25 23:08:23,"I believe that biological sex is the only sex-based characteristic that should be acknowledged by our society. My understanding of Gender Theory is that it is, in broad terms, the idea that gender and the concept of manhood or womanhood stems from some kind of social inheritance and that the primary differences between the sexes are the result of an individuals upbringing rather than biological factors. It to me has always seemed like a ridiculous solution to the very real problem of inequality between the sexes. In my opinion, a man or woman should be able to act in whatever way they prefer because of their rights as an individual, not because they are part of some ""special class"" that has a certain set of psychological characteristics inherent to them.

Worse yet, the idea of gender being a social construct has led many people to falsely believe that the only biological difference between the sexes is their genitals. The entire reason I'm here today is because a friend of a friend tried to argue, in all seriousness, that the only reason men are stronger than women is because society pushes them to workout more and do strength training. She absolutely refused to yield on this position even after I pointed out that my single rep max on bench press was higher than the world record for women in my weight class, and that the power lifters competing in these competitions would all be training far more often than me.

The more serious ramifications are situations where parents take their personal and highly politicized views on the subject and use it as justification to permanently and drastically alter their children's development through hormone therapy because they exhibit behavior in line with a certain gender or worse yet, trying to influence the outcome of their gender by insisting on said therapy. At the ages some of these treatments are occurring I was not responsible enough to pick out what clothes I was going to wear, let alone whether or not I should be replacing my hormones. In my mind parents who do this are no different than those parents who send their kid off to gay conversion therapy. It is cruel, and wrong, and setting their children up for self-hatred and depression.

CMV: Even if we assume the life begins at conception the government should not ban abortions.,2316,665,2020-01-03 04:45:07,"So, I know, I know there are WAY to many abortion CMVs here but I am curious about looking at it from a particular viewpoint.

I believe that the only morality consistent position is that life begins at conception (not the part of the CMV that I want changed).

However even if we agree on that (for the sake of this CMV agree with the position above) the government shouldn't ban abortion because the government cannot force someone to sacrifice their body for another, even if you are responsible for the other being in the situation they are in. An example is if I were to shoot someone and they WILL die unless I give them my blood,  the government cannot force me to give them my blood. Even though it is my fault they are dying and giving them my blood wouldn't cause any long term effects on me the government can't force me to do it.

So if you remove the fetus and attempt to let it live through the procedure (even though it has a 0% of being successful) then the government doesn't have the authority to force you to sacrifice your body for fetus.

Final note: under this world view abortion would be extremely immoral and evil but morality is not the point of this CMV, consistent legality is

"CMV: It is not morally wrong to place environmental regulations on industries like agriculture, oil/gas companies, or large factories to ensure a habitable Earth for future generations",2319,414,2019-07-28 23:55:33,"Many people, especially in the U.S., say that it is morally wrong or unconstitutional to regulate certain industries like agriculture, oil, etc... in the name of climate change. While you could argue that it is technically unconstitutional, I dont believe that it is morally wrong to regulate such things. 

While I understand that some regulations (e.g. not allowing truck drivers to use their diesel trucks and forcing them to replace those with more eco-friendly trucks/fuel) can put people or businesses out of work, I believe that the ends justify the means. There are many eco-friendly substitutions or different ways these companies can go about their business. While a more eco-friendly world can cost more money for large corporations, it is worth it to ensure that our current and future generations have a safe, habitable Earth to live in. If anything, I believe it is morally wrong to knowingly pollute and worsen the state of our planet and just leave it for future generations to take care of. Change starts now, and certain government regulations can help.

I understand that environmental regulations are very controversial and people have many different opinions on them. I'm open to hearing other sides of the argument, so please try and change my view.

Edit: My view hasn't been entirely changed, but I've given out a couple of deltas now to people who have made me realize the other side and understand more intimately how private companies and people are directly affected by regulations.",1
CMV: Praising an ultra free market means valuing the rich’s right to materials over the very lives of the poor.,2302,837,2019-08-05 00:15:51,"Jeff Bezos’s recent $400 million dollar yacht purchase got me here. Comments online are far more in support of it, with people giddy and cheering at the wonderful self-made hundred-billionaires deserved splurges (not that I believe it’s because most people are supporters, but the supporters are probably more fervent commenters).  

I, on the other hand, believe we need to do more to cut the wealth gap. Amazon shouldn’t be paying 0 in taxes, rather obviously to me.

To those who support the free market to the point that they praise a 400 million dollar ridiculous personal purchase, then are you not saying that you value Bezos’ and many others’ right to material than the very lives of poor people who’s basic needs are not even being met? If you find that to be an inaccurate conclusion, please change my view.

EDIT: I really should have posted when I had time to reply and get into it. Tonight I will have more individual responses...

But frankly, I find us of the first world apt to analyze such problems in an intricacy that, while valid, convolutes the real issue. Have all of your earnings lost, let’s say of no fault of anyone other than mother nature, and watch your children become malnourished and sick, and then see Bezos’s yacht docked before you, and tell me that you don’t think we should do more about the wealth gap. Tell me through a broken and cracked dehydrated voice, that upon analysis, you think its fine to just let the money end up where it ends up through the free market.

I don’t care how directly responsible Bezos is for poverty, I simply do not think that anyone should have such obnoxious abundance (I cannot stress this enough) while others do not have clean water. Im okay with some luxury, comfort, leisure, of course. I do not have an answer to where exactly the line should be drawn, and it will never be a perfect line, but I know that a 400 million dollar personal purchase is unjustifiable.",1
CMV: I prefer better public transportation to self driving cars investments in america,2304,255,2018-08-24 23:04:50,"I should clarify; I don't mean government subsidized or operated systems exclusively with public transportation, as the Japanese train system is private and also runs well. I mean any vast transportation network designed to ferry many people at a time or infrastructure more friendly to car alternatives, such as trains, trolleys, buses, better roads to include bike lanes and sidewalks, more pedestrian spaces etc. I'm not saying that we shouldn't invest in self driving technologies (we should), but I think that it would be more interesting and efficient to have companies work on improving mass transportation options in America. I'm talking about things like better rail networks, more bus only lanes and light/heavy rail options within metropolitan areas, bike lanes and wider sidewalk space at the expense of car lanes within cities at least. I definitely think self driving cars is a technology that will be invaluable in preventing accidents someday, but I wish we could also invest in good public transportation infrastructure in the meantime as well that already works well. I would love to go on trains cross-country rather than fly and sacrifice a day or two. In addition, I don't think self driving cars can solve the traffic or congestion issue, as that is not just a matter of efficiency or bad driving habits but also a matter of  space, which can be redirected better with more dense public transportation. 

Disclaimer: I do know how to drive, and I've driven extensively. I still prefer public transport.

edit: Thank you everyone for such a wide and varied response! I'll try my best to respond to everyone here, but I can't promise I'll be able to get through it all, but you guys have posted some really really interesting stuff, and I'm excited to keep talking to you all!

CMV: Comedians should be able to joke about anything,2299,452,2019-06-17 04:17:59,"Sorry about some of the things I reference in this post being quite outdated. I first wrote this post several months ago, but it got deleted because I posted it on a Friday. I forgot about it since, but I was going through my profile history and I thought I'd post this one again.

It's always quite disappointing to see internet mobs go after a comic for making edgy jokes. That is literally their job. For decades, it's been accepted that comedians make politically incorrect jokes, so I don't understand why anything should be off-limits. The people who buy tickets to see stand-up comedy are people who enjoy that kind of humor. If you are offended by it, just don't watch comedians that make those kinds of jokes.

In the age of social media, when people are outraged by something, their immediate reaction is to complain about it on social media. This leads to people who don't seem to even understand what a joke is trying to 'cancel' a comedian for making offensive jokes. Here's the thing. I don't think there's anything inherently harmful about telling an offensive joke. As long as a comedian isn't actually trying to convince his audience to do something hateful, I don't believe that there's been any harm done. Making jokes like this in a school or a workplace could be problematic, because the people around you may not want to hear that kind of stuff. But, when a comedian is performing a routine, he is surrounded by people who paid money to hear him be funny. They signed up for it.

Let's take the jokes that Louis CK most recently got lambasted for. He made fun of trans people and school shooting survivors. Were those jokes in poor taste? Absolutely. But did he say them in an environment where it was expected that he would make jokes like that? Yes! You can argue that those jokes weren't even funny. I would even be inclined to agree, as I think that Louis CK generally works best when he isn't trying to be offensive, but I still don't think that he should be given shit for those jokes. I'm sure that he doesn't actually hate kids who were in school shootings and I'm sure that like every other person with something resembling a heart, he has lots of sympathy for them. But people weren't listening to him reading his manifesto, they were listening to him doing what comedians do: telling jokes!

I think that we get into some very weird territory once we as a society try to all agree on where 'the lines' should be when it comes to comedy. That's why I really don't believe there should be one. I don't think that entertainers should have to censor themselves on the off-chance that somebody who gets offended easily will listen to a recording of them telling offensive jokes.

Please, let me know why you guys disagree with me. Let's just keep discussions to the question of *Should there be a 'line' when it comes to comedy?* I was only using Louis CK as an example, because he's one of the more recent cases of a comedian coming under fire for being 'too offensive'. So, let's not argue about all the shitty things he did and whether he should be doing comedy at all. That's a debate for another thread.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I'll stick around a while longer to reply to some more comments, but I just wanted to thank everyone who participated in this thread. I've had a great time discussing this topic with all of you. I kept reading so many excellent arguments on both sides and constantly having my view changed. This was my first post in this sub and I'm definitely looking forward to doing more!

"CMV: Publicly funded elections, along with other anti-corruption laws like gerrymandering prevention, would basically fix the US government.",2305,451,2018-12-20 00:17:23,"Probably the one thing EVERYONE in the US can agree on is that our federal government has a lot of problems. Nobody in politics seems to listen to anyone except their donors. If we eliminate lobby fundraising and private donations to politicians, we would flush out the corrupt politicians just looking to make money and bring in honest, hardworking people fighting for our interests. 

Instituting these laws (or maybe a Constitutional Amendment, I’m not an expert) would be, obviously, terrifically difficult. But nevertheless, I think it’s an appealing goal.


Edit: Just remembered that states set their own rules for elections, which complicates the issue. However, I hold the same view about making those elections publicly funded.

Edit 2: Ignore the gerrymandering thing, I’m more focused on publicly funded elections.",1
CMV: straight men being jokingly gay with each other is harmless/not homophobic,2294,247,2019-06-17 20:03:11,"straight guy here, but was having a debate with someone who said:

 that the way straight guys are jokingly ""gay"" with each other is essentially making homosexuality the butt of the joke, its making jokes about a demographic who as a straight male you cant understand their struggles/issues, and by making these jokes you're implying to each other that its okay to make fun of gay people? or that we are essentially finding homosexuality itself ""funny""? 

examples being idk how me and my mates if we're planning a holiday might say in our group chat ""can't wait to share a bed with you xoxo"", or if planning to hang out with just me and a buddy might say sth along the lines of ""looking forward to our intimate date night xoxo"" or name our group chat of all straight men ""men lovers only""?

there are just examples from my own experience but you see this type of straight guys jokingly being gay with each other a lot now

personally i see it as the opposite:

 its a way that we i guess express a greater level of closeness/affection towards each other where traditionally the toxic masculinity says men cant be affectionate with each other? I see it as straight men embracing homosexuality, making themselves more comfortable with it? It isn't like the jokes are "" a gay man walks into a bar"", we are the ""butts"" of the joke in this sense, it isn't making fun of other gay men or homosexuality in general?

I made the argument that just because I make racist jokes doesn't meant im going to discriminate have anything against someone of a different race, but the counter argument to this was the fact that im recognizing those jokes are racist whereas here I refuse to recognise these kind of jokes as homophobic.



but at the same time i couldn't pinpoint why i find this jokes i make with my friends funny when i had this debate, open to have my view changed/discussed",1
"CMV: Over the next 10-20 years, the biggest threat to most Americans will be the Republican party",2296,527,2017-08-14 21:05:42,"I know that title sounds extreme and I'm not saying that Trump, most Republican voters or politicians are more evil than ISIS or North Koreas government but I do think they'll cause more harm, especially if they can get away with their ideas.

Firstly, they will further ruin race relations and civic culture in America. By electing an inexperienced bully (Trump), supporting lying politicians who game the system (gerrymandering) and [strengthening white supremacists](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/charlottesville-and-the-rise-of-white-identity-politics/), the Republican party will increase the amount of hatred and violence in America. While Republicans may condemn the death in Virginia and the shooting in Alexandria, both incidents were inevitable given their extremist actions.

Secondly, by practicing gerrymandering, manipulating laws regarding elections and obstructing democrats at every level (federal and municipal), they will undermine democracy and further encourage hatred. By attacking the media and independent analysis, they undermine Americas ability to understand the problems it faces, encouraging the ignorance and stupidity that elected Trump.

Third, they will make killing people easier. Because of their support for guns, their support for violent police tactics and their recent laws which made it legal to hit protesters with their cars, Republicans will make it easier for Americans to kill each other in large numbers.

Fourth, their foreign policy is conducted by alt-right extremists, traditional aggressive Republicans and a thin skinned bully. This will only increase the chances of an attack from a terrorist group or rogue state while doing nothing to defeat them, as America will blunder through the rest of the world with no coherent strategy.

Fifth, climate change endangers the planet and Reoublicans' approach is to suppress this evidence to ensure they can maximise short term profits at the expense of future generations. This makes them, as Naomh Chomsky described, the most dangerous organisation in human history.

Sixth, their domestic policies will make America more indebted, poorer, less educated and less healthy. It will produce growth that reaches the wealthiest at the expense of most of the population. They will ruin the programs needed to help the poor improve themselves so they can enrich themselves, while blaming the declining living standards of their voters on the Chinese and Hispanic immigrants.

Finally while Republicans may think similar things about Democrats, that doesn't make them right. Democrats are more reasonable, informed, principled, moderate and open minded than Republicans and if they were in government America would be vastly better off in almost every respect.

CMV: Gender dysphoria is a mental illness,2291,650,2019-08-05 03:35:51,"If this opinion is offensive then I'm sorry, I don't intend to hurt trans people. 


The reason I'm doing this is because I got downvoted cus someone decided to search through my history and demonize me, instead of focusing on the argument. The mods banned me and told me I was wrong, but didn't say WHY I was wrong. I want to know if I don't understand trans people properly and am spreading rumors, or if my opinion is valid and these people just assumed I was a bigot and overreacted. If my opinion is wrong then it's not coming from spite or bigotry, but ignorance. That's why I posted on here, so I can learn the truth. 


Trans is NOT a mental illness, but gender dysphoria is. Not all trans people feel the dysphoria either. I view it as a mental illness because they feel pain from it. It's close to body dysphoria like anorexia. 


I'm not against transitioning, it is their bodies their choice. I will not and refuse to get in the way because I have no idea what's best for them, they do. I'm not calling them freaks for choosing to switch and I'm not saying it's the wrong decision to do so either. I'm neutral for people who transition, slightly leaning towards pro-transitioning because it requires a lot of courage and strength to do so. If it makes someone happier, who am I to get in the way of that? 


It's a similar mental illness (Edit: mental condition not mental illness) to autism or DID, since it's a part of your identity it shouldn't be ""cured."" It's more of trying to help the pain instead of trying to make the person ""normal."" The only reason I believe they should receive therapy is to learn tools to mitigate the dysphoria and to become more comfortable with who they are. It isn't a replacement of transitioning and it's not mandatory as well. Those who don't want to do it, shouldn't be forced to. 


Td;lr: Dysphoria is a mental illness, being trans isn't a mental illness and should not be ""cured.""


If you're going to comment please tell me if you're trans or cis. If you're trans can you tell me if: 


*You experience(d) dysphoria and how bad is/was it. 


*If you transitioned did it help you deal with the dysphoria? Or is it still there? 


If you're cis-gendered you can still comment and try to educate me, but please tell me that you're cis. The reason why I ask you to do this is because I need the perspectives of people who actually experience dysphoria, since they know what it actually feels like.


Edit: My mind is changed, I'm no longer going to call gender dysphoria a mental illness. It doesn't meet all of the criteria of a mental illness and it makes me look like a bigot if I say so.",1
CMV: The US spends WAY too much on the military,2285,500,2018-07-12 22:07:24,"Here are the basic pillars of my view:

1. Military spending dwarves other spending items: 

Military (or “national defense”) spending routinely accounts for more than half of the US federal budget—hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money— with little demonstrable material benefit. Meanwhile, other cost centers, like education, housing, transportation, science, etc. rarely crack 4% or 5% of the total budget, but do a lot more universal good than the US armed forces.

2. When you’re a hammer, every problem looks like a nail:

Having a large military encourages the US to use it in contexts where diplomacy, economic pressure, or other tools might be more effective. Furthermore, having,and constantly boasting about, the world’s largest military encourages OTHER nations that rely on the US to maintain world peace and order, forcing them to *continue* obscene levels of military spending and become embroiled in decades-long conflicts (see: Iraq)

3. The present state of affairs is just another vehicle for the 1% to grow wealthier at the expense of the everyone else:

A large proportion of US military spending is given to defense contractors—basically the Tony Starks of the word, but BEFORE he was iron man. Think Lockheed, Halliburton, and Blackwater. Those contractors are milking a classic concentrated benefits/diffuse costs scenario to line their pockets with BILLIONS of taxpayer dollars...all in service of cool toys, blowing shit up, and making sure that the rest of the world minds its Ps and Qs.

Edit: I’m getting tons of people pointing out that my figures refer to *discretionary* spending in the federal budget, which is true and valid. I should have pointed out that distinction in the post, but nonetheless, discretionary spending is all that matters. Entitlements like Medicare and Social Security benefit everyone once they are old enough and are mandatory spending items. The military, on the other hand, is completely at our discretion and *still* accounts for half a trillion dollars each year.",1
"CMV: We will not balance carbon emissions in time to ""save"" the planet.",2279,801,2019-04-11 23:25:48,"It's pretty simple really, carbon in - carbon out(of the atmosphere). We are over 400ppb now and climbing. Politicians are geared toward reelection and aren not making meaningful law changes. The boots on the ground that should be making those changes, the average citizen, are not. Gasoline engines are still being manufactured with a twenty year expected life span. Half the population in America thinks that climate change is a hoax. The oceans are acidifying and killing off species as carbonic acid dissolves into it, our biggest carbon sink. We still subsidize oil and airlines and ethanol corn and other detrimental programs. I have not noted anybody I know traveling less. Humans are increasingly sprawling out into the environment and devastating the ""lungs of the earth"" in places like Brazil, and yes, in first world countries. Trees are having trouble adapting to the changing climate in such a short time, and are dying off, causing increased fire risks(associated often with droughts). Permafrost melting is creating a positive feedback loop of methane into the atmosphere, increasing warming. Likewise with reduced albedo due to the soon to be ice free poles. Then you have new science coming out talking about clouds. Some may stop forming, and we may have less as a whole: more warming.

The planet is a rock floating in space, and I'm sure it will carry on without us. Micro organisms that metabolize sulfuric acid instead of oxygen will be ok. Something will carry on, but perhaps not humanity. Are we ok with that? The decisions we are making right now point to yes. It points to the travesty of the individual, not to be able to do whatever he/she wants with their life, despite how it might effect the planet over the next 100 years, beyond their life horizon.

My personal thought on our biggest hurdle: fundamental society design. We designed it, but not well. Our food transport systems are broken. Our ""commute to work"" lifestyle is energy intensive. Our houses are too big. Our economy is predicated on creating a ""need for more"" attitude, hence increasing waste. Most have more than they need, but unhappiness is at an all time high. The train is going at full speed, and it will be hard to turn around. Too hard.

I expect that within 300 years the feedback loops will have made droughts so severe weather will be highly unreliable for food crops(for maintaining a significant population, say 1 Billion). Erratic weather will mean early freezes, which have become more common. Moreover, the survival of humans as a whole is predicated on other species surviving, because we will presumably still eat meat, if it exists. Likely ocean fish will not. The land animals that survive will have to somehow overcome being exterminated by the most efficient hunter ever on this planet, the human. It happened to the great auk and the dodo, and the passenger pigeon. Why are deer any different?",1
CMV: Conservative Evangelicals have sold out for the GOP. What they “stand for” and what they actually support are no longer the same.,2276,497,2019-12-28 21:46:48,"As someone who grew up in the Bible Belt, it seems except for the single issue of abortion (which is a choice, and never impacts someone unless they choose to make that choice), the actions by the GOP go against the virtues they preach. It seems the GOP is only about making the rich richer, and the poor poorer, with the guise that they are helping everyone. They seem to be spreading false hate, don’t treat all people as people, support those that hurt others (hitting reporters, sexual assault, child predators, etc). I’ve tried to understand how anyone that has followed what has actually happened the past 3 years, and I simply can’t wrap my head around it.

Edit: On the subject of immigrants: They are a vital part of the Bible belts community. Who do they think runs all of these “Mexican” restaurants that people rave about, cuts tobacco and tends the fields, paints/builds/repairs your houses, mows the lawns, spreads mulch, fixes fence line, etc.?",1
"CMV: Posting suicide hotline information is essentially just a different form of ""thoughts and prayers"".",2269,182,2018-04-09 18:30:58,"People online, and certainly on reddit, love to both post and upvote reams of suicide hotlines around the world in response to notable or newsworthy suicides.  My feeling is that this is a naive and misguided response with no value. It allows the people posting and upvoting to placate themselves by saying ""Phew, at least I've done *something*"", much in the same way that ""thoughts and prayers"" placate a different demographic who feel powerless when faced with complex and unpalatable problems.

Suicidal people are not incoherent.  They know how to look up a suicide hotline.  Many suicidal people know because they have tried calling them, and had no good results.   

The whole exercise seems to think that suicidal people are just one phone all away from solving their problems, and that the only barrier to people making that call is that they don't know hotline services exist.  I think this is a very naive view that does not afford suicidal people, especially the long term suicidal, any agency or rationality. It trivialises suicidal ideation and offers a ""solution"" that has no merit beyond pacifying the non-suicidal.  Change my view.

"CMV: The employer's primary duty is not to necessitate workplace diversity, but to employ the most competent people available.",2266,412,2018-03-04 21:52:30,"While this is probably applicable to other fields, I'll be using STEM as an example because it's far more objective to test for quality and merit in those fields.

Frankly, it's not in the employer's business to have a diverse workplace. That burden should be on prospective employees.

Employment in any STEM-related field should be purely based on merit. Blindly so, even. If possible, all demographic metadata should be completely obscured in the employment process.
If the majority of people that end up employed are whites and Asians, then so be it.


This may sound prejudiced coming from someone who'd otherwise consider their self a progressive, but here's the thing:
Science, by its very nature, is a 'meritocracy'. Your output will always reflect your skill level and competence. In fact, it's so blindly meritocratic that your ideological affiliation and moral alignment don't matter. You're either a skilled engineer/doctor/scientist, or you're not.


For any science and tech based firm, company, etc the *primary* duty is to make the best quality of output achievable. The only way I can see this happening is if the best people for the job, are employed. After all, science and tech is far more than just regurgitating facts memorised in school. Old work has to be improved upon, and new ideas and research have to be developed. The ability to think, plus the creative skill the prospective employees have, are the most relevant parts of their resume.

When it comes to reattaching that spine, building that Starship, making that data security air-tight, making game servers run faster, etc., its your *ability* to make it happen, that is to be considered. If you just so happen to be female or a minority, then that's great. If you happen to be a white man, that's also great. In the end, it's the quality of results that matters. Crappy tech and research is the only sin in this context.

Furthermore, when it comes to these things, other people's lives and livelihoods are usually at stake with the possibility of structural failure, data compromise. surgical complication, etc. Even the best scientists, engineers, doctors and technicians can still make mistakes, so what hope does a less qualified person have?


Any issues with diversity should be addressed at the societal level of education, culture, etc and not at the employer's office.
If Google etx want diversity in the workplace, a thing to do is to funnel money and energy into raising awareness, and granting their targets the choice of higher quality education so that they can, if they wish, attain their own skills and assume the positions they are competent for. But when it comes to the actual employment, blind meritocracy is to be adhered to.


On a side note, aren't East Asians and Indians, etc 'minorities' in the West anymore? I may not be a sociologist, but I'm sure a workplace full of East Asians and Indians and what-have-you, is still quite diverse.


Small update:
People seem to be getting the wrong idea that my post is some sort of passive-aggressive shade at minorities and women.
For those willing to *actually listen*, what I am actually saying is that when it comes to certain highly technical fields, especially those in which the quality of the product can mean the difference between people dying and people not dying (e.g. Surgical medicine, Aerospace Engineering, Civil Engineering, etc) yes we acknowledge that some minorities don't have access to the education that would help them do well in these fields. But those concerns should be addressed at the *social* level - poverty, the justice system, educational system, discriminatory practices, cultural issues, etc and NOT at the employment level. The employer is supposed to be a mere gatekeeper, blind. All he holds is a sign saying 'MUST BE THIS COMPETENT TO PASS'. If the problems at the societal level are fixed, then quality workplace diversity will occur.",1
CMV: Mods who mute the ability to talk to them are not promoting healthy Reddit communities.,2263,262,2019-08-03 22:33:35,"Consider the reason for muting.  Is the reason valid?  Might be.  Is the person cussing/swearing/directly offensive?  Probably a valid reason to mute.  

&#x200B;

But take a step back.  If you're muting simply because you can't be bothered to do your job (which is moderate conversations), what are you really doing?  You're removing posters' ability to interact with the very people who are tasked with managing the community.

&#x200B;

If the local precinct one day said, ""okay, you two houses can no longer call, visit or otherwise contact us for 72 hours, no matter what crime is being conducted"", is that right?  Is that fair?  Even if it doesn't matter, the question is why do that?  You'd think it was silly.  A power trip for no reason other than a power trip.  And no, I don't accept ""Reddit makes you gods!""  That's a symptom of the problem, not the problem.  The problem is a lack of oversight with those decisions.  I don't mind the decision if it's a cussing/swearing/directly offensive someone, but they should still be able to interact with the mods and I think the mods should be mature enough to just block that user on their own account, or otherwise ignore the abuse.

&#x200B;

Thus the reason I previously advocated for a stronger appeals process on moderators who do this.  I frankly don't think there should be any situation that a single mod can mute a person from communicating with the mod group - and even if it was a group decision, I think it should be subject to higher level authority and override in the event it's a situation of improper bias.",1
CMV: The term “mansplaining” is inherently sexist.,2257,1331,2018-07-12 03:05:23,"Personally I feel as though this term is sexist and misused. 

From what I understand, the nature of using the term follows the assumption that a condescending person is sexist based on the fact that this person is a man.

How is this not inherently sexist?

Note that I am not denying any sort of institutional or societal sexism towards women that exists or has existed.

At the very least it is a term based on a stereotype that may or may not apply to a particular man, though it is used regardless.

 I am very aware I am on the inside looking out, and do not know what it is like to be on the outside looking in. I am asking this question with the intention of hearing other perspectives so please be my guest and poke holes in what I’ve said because I am looking for a greater understanding of the subject and wanted to ask in a place that I know would not be an echo chamber.

A few of my thoughts summed up:

1. The logic behind mansplaining is 
“*Some men* will *sometimes* speak condescendingly” 
This is comparable to 
“*Some women* will *sometimes* make decisions based on emotion (as opposed to logic)”

So how would you feel, as a woman, when you make a decision, to have your decision called womanciding?

Ken: hey did you hear about Janet? She isn’t talking to you anymore because you didn’t say hi to her last week

Dan: I figured. Janet is always womanciding

Obviously both men and women are capable of being emotional, so why call it *woman*ciding? I’m sure you can see my point here.

2. Both men and women are capable of being condescending, but a man doing it to a woman needs a specific term for it?

I think if you break it down the sexism lies in the assumption that a man who is condescending is just an asshole if it’s towards a man and sexist if it is towards a woman.

3. Why not just use “he is condescending” or “she is condescending” because both sexes are capable of being condescending. I feel like if you make a special word for one of them you are being obvious sexist. 

Here’s a comparable example

“He yelled at her”
Vs
“She bitched her out”

This clearly includes a more sexist term for the “She” sentence. My whole point is if we say “he yelled at her” we should also be saying “she yelled at her.” Just like we should be saying “She was condescending” and “he was condescending” instead of

“She was condescending to her”
Vs
“He was mansplaining to her”

4. “Mansplaining” seems petty and vengeful. You don’t know if the man you are speaking to is being condescending simply because he is an asshole. This is in effect creating a double standard where the belief is women can freely explain things to men but men cannot freely explain to women under risk of appearing to be a sexist. 

I don’t care for the societal/institutional argument where the claim is that sexism hurt women in the workplace and society because men had more power in those roles. I did not do that. I took no part in that and don’t know anyone that has. I’m sorry if someone you know was hurt by that happening but I had nothing to do with it and if you can associate me with that kind of sexism because of my gender, then you are the sexist one. 


I am very open to other perspectives and would love to hear what you have to say :)

CMV: Prostitution Should Be Legal,2256,827,2019-07-20 22:48:22,"I believe that prostitution should be legalized, specifically in the entirety United States of America. With new movement and progressive ideals sweeping through the world, many individuals have adopted a mental attitude towards sexual expression following the lines of, ""As long as it doesn't hurt anyone, and all parties are consenting, then I have no problem with it."" Legalized prostitution would ensure that both parties would always be consensual and thus would fulfill the criteria above.

 Furthermore, legalizing prostitution would allow for more regulation. I am envisioning this regulation to consist of licensing to prostitutes which can be revoke if drug use, stds, etc... are detected. This would drastically reduce the spread of STDs from prostution. This is vital as ""\[the\] rates of STIs are from 5 to 60 times higher among sex workers than in general populations"" ([https://iqsolutions.com/section/ideas/sex-workers-and-stis-ignored-epidemic](https://iqsolutions.com/section/ideas/sex-workers-and-stis-ignored-epidemic)). Legalizing prostitution would also drastically lower sex trafficking as people would much prefer to hire a regulated prostitute who is vetted to be safe than
the opposite.

 Lastly, regulation also means tax, which would mean more money for the government. I don't have specific numbers, but if implemented properly, legalizing prostitution could net the government money.

Edit 1: Many have pointed out that my initial claim that ""Legalizing prostitution would also drastically lower sex trafficking"" is not valid. Many sources have been thrown around and the only conclusion I draw from so many conflicting sources is that more research is needed into the topic.

This should be automatic and subreddits should have a mandatory reason for removal that must be selected when the post is removed. I think this is important so that someone doesn't end up waiting hours for responses that will never come to a deleted post and so that people can actually know when they are violating rules so they can reform. I have never moderated a subreddit before so I cannot say for sure that this is correct but I think that this may lead to people reposting their threads more since they think their old threads were simply not posted at the right time and didn't get many responses as opposed to their thread being removed. Shadowbanning may be a good idea for some users but this should be something involving reddit admins as opposed to subreddits.

imo in a true democracy everyone should be able to choose whether they want to vote or not. not showing up to the polling station at all is also a form of participation, because you're still *choosing* not to vote for anyone. making voting mandatory encourages people who have not done any research and don't care about politics in any way to just check one of the boxes to get it over with.

CMV: The idea that taxation is theft is a clear sign of a failure in the educational system.,2223,1297,2017-12-04 07:32:25,"In my travels through the internet I've read plenty of times the argument that taxation is a form of theft on the part of the government. I honestly think that this idea springs from a failure on the part of the educational system to explain how democratic societies work.

I can only talk about the education I had, so I think it's appropiate to point a few details. I'm from Argentina, where the Ministery of Education dictates what topics should be adressed during our 6 years of secondary school. From years 2-5 we have a subject called Citizen and Ethical Formation which focuses on teaching human rights, forms of discrimination, how the constitution and our goverment works, etc. 

So, one of the big points we are taught when it comes to taxation is that it is necesary for a society to function, a country can **not** rely solely on it's industry and exports to mantain a good level of life for its citizens.

To me, this idea that taxation is theft shows how little people understand about societies and how they function, but there may be a detail I'm missing, like political leaning or personal prejudice.

Anyway, I would like to hear specially from any American that thinks this way, almost every time I read about this argument it seems to come from our neighbours up north.

CMV: The United States of America needs to rely more on their state governments and less on the federal government.,2219,261,2019-04-04 05:32:00,"First and for most, I'm going to point out that this view is actually relatively unmotivated by specific politics. Of course investment is going to come from the government, but I want to make it absolutely clear that what I'm speaking about is beyond just political party A and political party B.

The United States, for all intents and purposes were a set of regulated territories that self-govern under a larger government's guidelines. This was put into place so that the states could protect their people and attend to their more specific needs while bigger/international problems could be handled by the federal government. All 50 of our states however, have become dependent on the federal government for guidance, and the Federal government has grown greedy when it comes to it's need for the states to rely on it.

I believe this is because the government, at some point, probably by accident, started to become more federally dependent. State governments have a duty to their people, they exist to fill the niche of the territory it inhabits--what works in Inflation-over-growth California won't work in Rustbelt Michigan, and what works in Fly-over South Dakota isn't gonna work in big-apple New York.

Lets take marijuana as an example: States lately have been legalizing marijuana, one of the few times they undermine federal law to pass rules that are specific to their own territories. Federally banning Marijuana never made any sense, and in doing so the over-arching US government has crippled potentially booming markets because it's considered drug trafficking to move cannabis over state lines--even to other legal states.

We also have to accept that culturally, the United States is not, and will not ever be homogeneous. I think when we fail to realize that states will never agree with each other, because fundamentally they all have different roots and infrastructure that sets up their foundation. That's fine. But when you apply sweeping rule changes across the whole country, it can isolate states and polarize them because they feel they can claim victim-hood for having their opinions stamped out.

Now, I guess my argument to be surmised as this:

When we give so much power to the federal government we are forgetting that the strength of the United States is that State Citizenship is akin to a liquid asset and it's one that gives the people the most power. If people don't like your state, they \*will\* leave. If they leave, your state's infrastructure crumbles. If the federal government applies sweeping rules to try and fix that problem, it could fuck-up the equilibrium else where. If the states have to rely on people inhabiting their states for power, then that, by default, gives people more of a voice in their government.  


Edit: Or in other words, it's time to start treating the states more like the little countries they are and let the federal government focus less on internal affairs.",1

Levelling a forest, or sparsely populated coastal area, or even a straight isolated military target, would have made for clear evidence that would have led to Japan's surrender without so many thousands of dead.

CMV: someone being my family member doesn’t mean I should give them a pass on bad behavior,2208,145,2018-12-21 02:25:18,"With the holiday season, it’s the time of year where racist uncles and thrice divorced aunts start showing up, and the age old argument will be thrown out: “I know you don’t like them, but they’re family so you need to get along and give them a pass.”

My opinion is that someone being family doesn’t earn them anything. If nothing about them was different except for that they weren’t my family, would I still have to respect them and like them?  I think no. I think there need to be more reasons. I think family gets a pass too much. 

I’ll never forget the time my brother gave me a black eye and bloody nose but I was the one in trouble for staying mad about it and wanting to file a police report. I was rightfully afraid, but my parents talked me down. “He’s your brother”, they said, “and we treat family differently. You need to give him more chances. You two have to get along because that’s what family does.”  I’m sad to admit they guilted me into letting him get away with knocking me out with his fists. I don’t think I’m the first person or the last who was guilted into giving family members a pass on bad behavior. 

I think if anyone, family or not, is to get a pass on bad behavior, better reasons need to be given. I don’t think there’s any legitimate moral obligation to put family on a pedestal and a think doing so is dangerous and unhealthy. 

My view could be changed if I can be convinced that someone being a family member is the only reason there needs to be to let someone get away with behavior you otherwise would call out or do something about. For example: if someone at the dinner table was overtly racist, convince me that I should only call out the racism and comment on it if the person isn’t my family. 

CMV. 

Edit: I’ll define giving a pass: giving a pass includes taking no action that could lead the offender to think they’ve offended. If someone beats you up, giving a pass means you tell them it’s all good and that you’re not mad about it. If someone is racist, giving a pass means you will agree, nod your head, stay silent, etc so long as the speaker is able to keep thinking nobody has a problem with their comments. ",1

If this person fails a suicide attempt, they may be put on suicide watch or physically prevented from ending their consciousness.

When I was in jail, it saddened me how difficult the institution made it to kill yourself and if you failed, harsh punishments followed.

cmv: The Separation of church and state does not mean that morals can't be religiously sourced,2199,605,2020-10-14 03:40:39,"The argument I make more specifically is that the separation of church and state means that an individual who is a government leader can't also be a religious leader at the same time. This does not mean that any moral that comes from a religion or religious text can't be used in politics or that a voter is required to provide a non-religious reason for their moral opinion and the way they vote.

The reason I say this is this; we try to separate politics and religion in our heads which is difficult, because politics is in large part deciding what should and shouldn't be punished based on morals and what's good for society, and religion is where many people get their ideas of what is right and wrong. For example, if India has many laws reflecting Hindu values but their government leadership is not participating in religious leadership roles at the same time, I don't see anything wrong with that. The majority of India holds certain values, they all vote and those values affect law, and the law reflects the religious ideas of the majority of it's citizens. The government is still ran by its citizens, not by a church,   and this government is still not amorally influenced by a church, just all of its voting citizens. Indian citizens shouldn't be required to show you where they got a moral from to show that it's not influenced by Hinduism and therefore a valid opinion to have.

Lets say that it is illegal to eat a cow in India and someone could say to a Indian ""Your opinion is affected by your religion so it has no place in politics and shouldn't affect your vote"". Then the Indian believer says ""actually I'm not religious, I just believe that it is wrong to kill and eat cows"". Then what? His opinion is now worth more because it came from a different source?

For background, I am a Christian and I make this argument because it is common to hear ""you can't let that belief affect your vote and it should have no place in politics because it came from the bible"". I often think to myself ""well then fine, lets say I'm an atheist. I don't believe in God and this moral opinion I have is a result of some atheistic moral feeling or abstract reasoning, and doesn't come from a religious text. Is it valid then?"". I think all morals aren't from science because there's nothing scientific about assigning value to human life or wanting to alleviate someone else's pain. Morals are things we take from our religion, upbringing, and a voice from inside us, and we are entitled to our opinion no matter where it came from (I suppose if you consider climate change a ""moral"" issue then there is an exception and probably a few others).

I do understand as well that if the majority of a nation thinks a way that I don't, then I should know that they determine the policy, and I agreed to a democratic government and in turn agree to the laws elected by it. I will vote the way I will and if I'm not the majority, they won fair and square and that's the way it is.

CMV: YouTube’s monetization policies and methods to crack down on “hate speech” are unfair and wrong,2195,304,2019-08-17 21:33:13,"So I’ve used YouTube for a long time, mostly to watch educational videos about history. I’m a big history buff, especially about military history and World War II. One of my favorite channels is the TimeGhost group, Indy Neidell and the team responsible for The Great War, World War Two, and more.

TimeGhost delivers quality educational content that is comprehensive, engaging, fun, well-sourced, relatively impartial, and above all, responsible. They have many times emphasized the controversies and touchiness of the subjects they are covering, such as the changing names of the places they use in the show.

Recently, TimeGhost [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldWarTwoChannel/comments/chbub3/monetize_this_youtube_ww2_cat_01_july_24_1940/) that their videos have been [demonetized](https://youtu.be/-Ze6-knFF2Y), and are not promoted by the YouTube algorithms. The reason, they learned from contact with YouTube, is that videos covering “controversial subjects” aren’t monetized, meaning they aren’t promoted by the algorithm. The issue is that “controversial subject” includes all war, political disputes, genocide, extreme political groups, etc. So by this definition, YouTube is basically saying they won’t monetize anything about *human history*, much less World War II. Here’s their [summary](https://youtu.be/dpvq8iYXcx0) of what happened for more details.

Worse, one of World War Two’s videos (May 18 1940, the episode focusing on the German attack against the Allies) was [taken down](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorldWarTwoChannel/comments/clkenl/you_escalates_censorship_of_history/) by YouTube for a “community guidelines violation.” Presumably the video was flagged because it contained footage of the Wehrmacht in action while discussing the German offensive. To their credit, the video was later restored, but it should have never happened at all.

Nor is this an isolated incident: the channel KnightSGC, who made excellent, high quality fan music videos ([example](https://youtu.be/inaqtJr-PTk)) for Sabaton songs (combining the songs with historical footage and other historical media in a tasteful and dramatic way), was [banned](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.oneangrygamer.net/2019/08/youtube-terminates-knight-sgcs-sabaton-themed-account-for-hate-speech/90112/amp/) for the same “community guideline violation.” [KnightSGC](https://www.reddit.com/r/sabaton/comments/clbmm3/knight_sgc_terminated_again/) released these music videos on a wide variety of Sabaton songs—the [video](https://youtu.be/GatuXfmJ-Fo) for the song “Ghost Division,” which again depicts the Wehrmacht, cannot possibly be interpreted as endorsing Nazism.

This is a [pervasive problem](https://www.google.com/amp/s/beta.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/06/13/how-youtube-erased-history-its-battle-against-white-supremacy/%3FoutputType%3Damp) I have with YouTube’s attempts to clear out hate speech and neo-Nazism: they are systematically demonetizing, alienating, and eliminating responsible creators. Educational videos about WWII have been taken down because of using Nazi imagery. TimeGhost, one of the best educational producers, has been wronged. YouTube’s algorithms are far too stringent, to the point where they are literally censoring history and penalizing good creators.

I think now more than ever, in a climate of rising white nationalism, we need good coverage of Nazism and what it led to. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. And, people who cover Nazism in a responsible way should not be penalized. YouTube’s methods of removing hate speech are immensely destructive to this, and are unfair.

CMV: Transgender individuals should compete with their biological gender,2193,762,2019-07-15 18:23:38,"BIG EDIT: I goofed-- biological gender isn't a thing, I meant biological SEX. Sorry for the miss. 

\---

To start off, I'm cis, but very pro-transgender rights and I have a lot of transgender friends. Thats one of the reasons that I'm bringing this up-- despite my support, the way I see it, transgender individuals should compete with the sex they were assigned at birth at least from the collegiate level, and I worry that this belief may be based in some inherent bias which I would hope to extinguish for the sake of my friends.

The reason I justify this belief is the fact that we separate the sexes for sports (theoretically) based upon the biological advantage that men have over women. If we are basing sport segregation off of biological make-up of the players, then it makes sense to me that transgender individuals compete with the team they are biologically a part of. I understand that it may be restricting for many people who are transgender and want to compete in sports, but may not feel comfortable competing with a gender they don't identify as, but I also feel that for many female athletes, it may put them at a disadvantage being required to compete with individuals that have a strong biological advantage and presenting this disadvantage goes against the spirit of segregating sports by sex in the first place.

&#x200B;

I suppose the main thing that could change my view is that the biological advantage is not that strong or that those that transition lose their biological advantage, but I'm open to hearing other ideas.

Also disclaimer, I don't know if I'm entirely pro full sex segregation in general. I would honestly prefer something more like what the international chess leagues do, which is allow for female competitive spaces but also provide for both sexes to compete together.",1
CMV: Cheating is unforgivable because it shows horrible character and lack of self control. Forgiving this shows lack of self respect.,2183,594,2018-07-31 21:39:14,"EDIT: When I said ""forgive"", I meant forgiving and continuing the relationship.

I've looked up similar posts and still don't understand the argument for cheating. I noticed that cheating has been normalized  in the media and in real life. People have straight up told me to expect to be cheated on because men are like mindless animals that lack self-control, which I won't believe so please don't use this argument. It's sexist if you ask me.

Let me first define cheating. Cheating is telling your partner you won't be having a sexual or romantic relationship outside your relationship, but still doing it. It's not considered cheating to me if it's an open relationship or you were forced with violence and whatnot.

Also, when talking of relationships, I mean mutual relationships that have or had love in them. I don't want to hear of forced marriages, abusive relationships, or bad arranged marriages cause those have a very different dynamic from what I'm thinking about.

If the passion has died in your relationship, it is better to break off the relationship. I don't mean divorce though cause I know that involves money and can be messy, but people can acknowledge the death of a relationship and separate at least. 

To me, if you cheat that means you don't love your SO. If you really love your SO and understand the pain it would cause them, you wouldn't consider cheating. It's a horrible thing to do and serial cheaters come off as sociopaths. If your SO is having problems sexually and you cheat, that's basically showing that sexual satisfaction was more important than the emotional bond you shared. There's also many ways to attempt to resolve this issue. And if it's that big of a deal and unsolvable, you can move on to an open relationship or separate/break up. Cheating is a form of emotional abuse and forgiving it and getting back together is pretty naive. They say they won't do it again until they are doing it again except this abuse is more covert.

People who take back those who cheat come off as extremely desperate for the financial benefits in the relationship and/or the emotional support they felt in the relationship. I feel when people take back people who cheat, it's because they don't feel they'll ever find anyone to replace what they had (which can be a valid point, but still sad/desperate). IMO I feel it's a better bet to live the rest of your life without a cheater than with someone who will disrespect your emotions like that.

I feel this all makes perfect sense, but it's like the older I get the more people are acting like I'm living in fantasy land. Beautiful independent women are taking back horrible men after cheating with multiple women. Great men are taking back women who cheat too. What's going on?",1
CMV: College athletes should be able to make money off of their own likeness.,2183,282,2019-04-22 21:07:20," 

College athletes should be able to make money off of their own likeness. 

While many people argue against this by saying they get enough of a benefit by being able to get a scholarship, that still is not enough compensation compared to people with other skills. For example, an artist can get a scholarship for being good at art. That artist can go to school for free and sell their paintings and make money off of their skill. 

There is no reason why college athletes shouldn’t be able to make money off of their own likeness in the free market like anyone else with a skill.",1
CMV:Suicide is an acceptable right of any adult even if they aren't physically in pain or dying.,2176,543,2017-05-01 22:47:24,"Not including people with deathly illnesses or with dibilitating and painful health issues.

I believe that people in emotional and psychological pain be allowed to commit suicide and that actions to stop them via the government and health officials is wrong. Additionally, I believe that intervention  by friends and family to seek help because of the family's own emotional reasons (ex: they will miss the suicidal person and be affected by such a situation) is wrong and should not be thrust upon the person as reasons to avoid what they believe is the solution to their problems. 

Here are some quotes from great thinkers on the subject:


> They tell us that Suicide is the greatest piece of Cowardice... That Suicide is wrong; when it is quite obvious that there is nothing in this world to which every man has a more unassailable title than to his own life and person.

> He who contemplates suicide should ask himself whether his action can be consistent with the idea of humanity as an end in itself.
> - Kant

CMV: Movements and campaign where the overall message is that every woman is beautiful misses the mark at best and is exploitative at worst.,2171,211,2019-03-09 21:54:38,"Thinking specifically of a campaign such as Dove’s real beauty or movements such as body positivity.

While I agree that women should not be ashamed if they do not have the proportions of models and actresses, telling women that they are beautiful no matter what is problematic and this is why:

Not only is that statement by definition false (everyone can’t be above average; most people are average-looking), but more importantly, it perpetuates the idea that women have to be attractive to be valuable. 

A better movement would ignore women’s appearance together and focus on their contribution to society. This is why I really get behinds movements such as the push to get more women in STEM fields. 

Obviously, it is much better marketing for dove to run a commercial saying “we think you are all beautiful and that’s great” opposed to “some of you are unattractive and most of you are about average but that’s ok because you have other, more important ways to contribute”

I feel that as long as a woman’s worth is being tied to her appearance we are perpetuating a lot of the sexism and objectification that has kept women down in the past. 

Edit:

This has been a pretty good convo. I just want to add and clarify a few things. My central thesis was what I said in the title. Some people chose to focus on my statement that by definition most people can’t be above average. That borders on semantics and while it is an important part of the conversation, the crux of my CMV was that emphasizing that everyone is beautiful perpetuates that women have to be beautiful to be seen as valuable or worthy. 

Some people also focused on my comment on STEM fields. This was merely an example of a movement that does a better job of empowering women. It was an example, it could have been teaching financial literacy, self defense, anything. 

Overall, thanks for the feedback. My biggest takeaway is that beauty may not *necessarily* follow a bell curve distribution. And I gave that comment a delta.  ",1
CMV: Cultural appropriation is counterproductive towards attempts to ease racial discrimination. The modern concept of cultural appropriation is inherently racist due to the cultural barriers that it produces.,2162,636,2019-09-11 21:39:33,"As an Asian, I have always thought of the western idea of appropriation to be too excessive. I do not understand how the celebration of another's culture would be offensive or harmful. In the first place, culture is meant to be shared. The coexistence of two varying populations will always lead to the sharing of culture. By allowing culture to be shared, trust and understanding is established between groups. 

&#x200B;

Since the psychology of an individual is greatly influenced by culture, understanding one's culture means understanding one's feelings and ideas. If that is the case, appropriation is creating a divide between peoples. Treating culture as exclusive to one group only would lead to greater tension between minorities and majorities in the long run.

Edit: I learned a lot! Thank you for the replies guys! I'm really happy to listen from both sides of the spectrum regarding this topic, as I've come to understand how large history plays into culture of a people.",1
"CMV: Lie detectors are highly inconclusive, and people should stop insisting on using them as a method for determining the truth",2160,247,2018-09-14 23:01:25,"Lie detectors measure certainly physiological responses, such as blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and skin conductivity. These do not necessarily correspond with truth telling, though they would often correspond with discomfort, nervousness, excitement, etc. 

A skilled polygraph administrator could use psychological tactics to get omissions from people, but this usually relies on the person believing that lie detectors actually reflect whether someone is being deceptive, which they do not. 

To me it seems absurd that polygraphs are still used in the hiring process of certain federal positions. It also frustrates me when there is some accusations and people in the media call out for these people to take a polygraph, as if a polygraph can settle whether someone did or did not perform a crime.

CMV: The anti-gmo movement is slowing down progress and possibly harming the consumers as well.,2159,706,2018-05-08 10:40:51,"This does not stop just at GMOs, the same is true for artificial sweeteners, all organic produce and beef. Being able to genetically modify our food gives us the ability to design plants to better suit human consumption. We can engineer plants to make pests avoid them, removing pesticides and making the plant healthier. We can make them grow better which means more food and less people hungry.
The main reason for veganism is so animals don’t get killed, but scientists are trying to grow meat in labs, which means cruelty free meat. But with the current stigma against GMOs and similar subjects, amazing technologies such as lab grown meat could be delayed by decades.

Even the worst murders, rapists, even terrorists do not lose their citizenship as a result of their crimes when they're committed within the country.  I don't see any reason why this should change when the crime is committed outside of the country.  And really, isn't this exactly what treason laws are for?",1
CMV: It is unrealistic to expect to have 50% of a film crew on major films and television to be women,2145,571,2019-01-10 21:15:42,"**Edit 1**: It is unclear to me whether King's quote is referring to women casting or women in production roles. I have data regarding production roles below. If anybody has some for women casting that would be awesome.

**Edit 2**: Super interesting discussions being had. Many being had regarding race as well as gender. I've responded to as much as I'm willing to tonight but will reply to more in the morning. I can confidently say that my view is evolving as I read more comments and hear various perspectives and rebuttals. 

At the Golden Globes, Regina King stated ""“The reason why we do this is because we understand that our microphones are big and we are speaking for everyone,” she said. “And I just want to say that I’m going to use my platform right now to say in the next two years, everything that I produce, I’m making a vow — it’s going to be tough — to make sure that everything that I produce that is 50% women.”

I respect King as an actress and think that she has good intentions in bringing more representation to women in the film industry. That said I think it's entirely unrealistic statistically speaking and based on the mater of supply and demand. 

[https://womenandhollywood.com/resources/statistics/](https://womenandhollywood.com/resources/statistics/) 

Until more women are in the film industry especially roles such as composer, director, and cinematographer then truly 50% could be possible. That said I find it unfortunate and slightly sexist that she would pick someone based on gender instead of ability or best fit for the role/job. 

In terms of statistics, in the top 100 films of 2017-2018, women comprised of the following: 

4% of directors

15% of writers

3% of cinematographers

18% of producers

18% of executive producers

14% of editors

Regina King has oversimplified getting women on to her future projects and doesn't understand the way supply and demand work in terms of the job market and availability. 

I'm open to opposing viewpoints and even willing to admit that maybe I don't have the perspective of it others might have. Change My View.

CMV: Religion is a primitive concept that should no longer have a place in modern society,2150,372,2018-02-08 21:09:14,"I think that religion is just a way for people to explain and cope with events such as death and natural disasters and to give their lives meaning as well as feel a part of something.

The fact that some people truly believe in these religious scriptures and for the most part don't question them, prey to a god that they have no evidence even exists and adhere to strict religious guidelines is, in this day and age, a form of delusion.

**FINAL EDIT**


Thank you each and everyone that contributed to this discussion. This has been immensely helpful and mind expanding. My goal in making this post was to grow and challenge my own stubborn views and you have all helped that happen. Its so easy to cast judgements without truly understanding the origin of other peoples views. I feel as though I have completely shifted my view on religion as a result of this thread.",1
"CMV: Voting in ignorance or indifference is irresponsible and an abuse of a democratic right, more so than not voting at all.",2144,214,2019-05-30 00:20:51,"There seems to be an inherent stigma when it comes to voting. You *must* vote.

Why?

Here are what I feel are legitimate reasons as to why someone might not want to vote

1. **I don't want to support any of the individual candidates with my vote**. I haven't felt strongly enough about any of the parties or candidates.
2. **I don't believe that my vote counts for anything due to the voting system in place.** In Britain we have a first-past-the-post system. Live in a particular party stronghold? You might as well just close your eyes and draw an 'X'
3. **I don't feel that I know enough about the possible outcomes of the election**. If I don't understand or care about the implications of my vote then it's frankly irresponsible for me to cast a vote.

&#x200B;

Here are some of the common arguments I've seen and acknowledged but haven't changed my mind.

1. **Spoil your ballot paper.** This process seems simply arbitrary and petty.
2. **""If you don't vote, you can't complain"".** This is my most hated political platitude. To me it's not far off being pure social manipulation in order to get you to adhere to the system and force you into an opinion. See reasons above. A vote shouldn't ever be considered as means to buy an opinion.
3. **Some countries don't have democracy/people died for your right.** I have voted before and am a full supporter of democracy. I wholeheartedly appreciate those who have fought for my right to be free. I feel that my right not to vote is equal to my right to vote, this isn't a 'but', they are mutually exclusive in my eyes. Being forced to vote by any means is undemocratic.
4. **There's no excuse to feel disenfranchised, it's your responsibility to educate yourself.** This I agree with, though I don't see it as any legitimate reason as to why I should vote. I can educate myself on and assess all the candidates and still not want to vote for any of them.

&#x200B;

As per the rules of this sub, I am here to have my mind changed, I'd just like a logical reason why I'm wrong to feel the way I do.

&#x200B;

Edit: I didn't expect so many replies. I'm trying to read them all. It's great this has sparked such good discussion. I feel that I need to clarify a few things so I'm leaving the edit at the top in order to prevent confusion.

1. ""I don't feel that I know enough"" is a self-acknowledgement that the individual does not know enough come election day and therefore, imo is responsible not to vote in that circumstance. This does not tie in to ""if you don't vote, you can't complain"" as I don't see why this person should vote at random in order to be entitled to 'complain'. Do I think they should complain? Would be weird if they did. Should I *refuse* to respect their opinion because they didn't vote? Absolutely not, I respect someone who admits they just don't know. That's a favourable outcome to me.
2. I'm seeing a lot of comments along the lines of 'not voting = not caring'.  A vote should not buy you a right to complain in a democracy, you should have that right already. You should not have to vote in order to care or take part, the logic just isn't there.

Edit II:

1. Still seeing comments about supposedly 'not caring'. I can only see this as an emotional respose so it's not that helpful. Also there's a lot of nitpicking over my reasons why someone might not vote (""define ignorant"" has been posted numerous times), instead of reasons why the individual should. 
2. I'm most convinced that should I not know who to vote for I should spoil my ballot. I'm surprised that it wasn't brought up more. Despite me calling it petty, to me it makes the most sense. I'm leaving the house and participating (so I earn my complaint token), I've done my research and still not felt that I can morally cross a box. Most of the replies have been in annoyance that I haven't *picked a side* and that there's no excuse for not having *picked a side.* I think that's really poor.

**Conclusion:** *""Don't vote, can't complain""*. I don't actually think that voting gives you any more legitimate means to complain. Brexit is a prime example. If you voted to Remain in the EU you are labelled a 'Remoaner' or a 'loser', you're told that you cannot complain about the outcome of a democratic vote, in the worst case, people have been described as traitors for protesting the outcome of the referendum. A vote buys you nothing in that situation. Also, if you didn't vote in an election, you may well regret it, there is no logical reason why your opinion is invalid. Where does that logic end? 

Going forward I probably won't opt to abstain from an election. Spoiling my ballot is the way to go when I'm on the fence. I do care, I do pay attention, I do wish to excercise my right, I don't however think I need to pick a side if I really can't.

This post was born out of many things, mainly due to recent elections in the UK where I was completely torn about who to vote for. My ususal party was not aligning with the values that I hold. I did vote, but I don't feel great about it.",1
CMV: Tenure for University Professors should not exist and creates a culture where teachers don’t need to care about their students/ course work to keep their jobs,2130,206,2019-12-11 05:25:50,"I am a senior at Towson University in Maryland and over the course of my four years here I can say with confidence that I have only had 2 teachers that genuinely care about the students in the class and making sure we actually learn the material, not just memorize it for a test and forget it right after.

In my opinion and experience, teachers who have tenure do not care about the students at all and they give off this nonchalant, almost apathetic vibe and it feels like we come to class and the teacher just goes through the motions and just gives the lecture and lets us leave and I end up teaching myself the entire semester anyway. During high school or my freshman year I wouldn’t be opposed to this at all because all my classes weren’t that important. Now I’m taking major classes and required courses I need to graduate on time and this is the way my teachers are going about it. 

Just to give everyone an example from this semester: 
After my first test this semester in Finance 331(which for some reason is the intro class in the business school) a little more than half the class failed the test. Our teacher gets up in front of the room and says to us “come on guys, this really isn’t THAT hard. If I can do it so can you” 
How exactly am I supposed to be comfortable talking to this teacher or going to his office hours to ask for help if I’m being ridiculed for not understanding the material? And on top of that, how does this teacher not get reprimanded or punished in some capacity for more than half the class failing the first test? My answer is tenure.

If this professor and other professors who behave this way did not have tenure, they would be forced to actually teach the class in a way that the whole section would understand and not just throw on the PowerPoints and call it a day.

This may just be an issue at my university but I just want to know other’s opinions and see if my view is skewed or biased just from being at my school.

Edit: Thank you for all the replies! My view really has been changed. I misunderstood the real definition of tenure and the real job responsibilities of a university professor. I still encourage everyone to read the whole thread and add to the discussion!",1
"CMV: Immigrants in the U.S. are not a problem, but those who enter the U.S. without going through the standard procedures, all other legal immigrants went through, have no right to stay.",2132,1220,2018-10-12 07:44:14,"Recently, in NY, there are signs that have been popping up reminding people of their ""duty"" to report undocumented immigrants [See KTLA](https://ktla.com/2018/10/11/ominous-flyer-urging-people-to-report-undocumented-immigrants-to-ice-pops-up-in-nyc/). While the article argues that it *intimidates* immigrants, I don't see the issue behind it.

I'm quite aware that immigrants are a fundamental part of the U.S., being a second generation Asian-American myself). My parents and countless other immigrants went through the standard procedures of U.S. immigrant through naturalization and all that jazz (don't know too much about the process). Yet, we are more and more frequently being reminded of the many immigrants who entered the country bypassing all of the procedures we have already outlined.

In my opinion, those people who bypass those procedures have no right to stay in our country, and the NYC signs reflect that idea. They have indeed violated the law when it comes to immigration in the U.S. Similarly, ""sanctuary cities"" like LA and NYC are merely obstructing justice when it comes to the undocumented immigrants. While treating illegal aliens inhumanely (as we so often see) is clearly unacceptable, they should still be subject to the laws and regulations we have regarding these immigration, and should not just be given a free pass because immigration reform is a controversial topic.

CMV: Marvel movies would better better for the viewer if they didn't reveal major plot points in the trailer,2134,146,2017-11-28 06:07:07,"Example 1 Captain America: Civil War; if they didn't show Spider-Man and Black Panther in the trailer the movie would have been better because you let the viewer be surprised that these characters are actually in the movie.

Example 2 Thor: Ragnarok; When you saw the Thor Ragnarok trailer or even first heard that Hulk was going to be in the movie what was your reaction to it? I am guessing you were surprised, amazed, excited right? Imagine seeing them first showing up on the big screen. 

By showing the characters in the trailer they unintentionally make it so these emotions you are supposed to be feeling in the movie are dulled.",1
"CMV: As a Venezuelan citizen, I believe Socialism is evil and will never work.",2134,932,2018-06-29 16:50:59,"READ END OF POST. I AM DONE. Born and raised in Venezuela. Lived there for 20 years. Have been in the U.S for 2 years (Student Visa). I saw my country go from a place with a reasonable standard of living to a poor, crime ridden place in two decades. Sure it wasn't perfect, but it was way better than it is now. People were certainly not starving to death. The Venezuelan government has applied Socialist policies faithfully. Government housing, free (Shitty) education high taxes and above all, seizing the means of production (the central tennet of socialism at least according to my understanding of the communist manifesto). Every company that the government takes, is mismanaged and goes broke, they all present millions of dollars in losses, we don't produce anything anymore, even our oil production is down and we have to import gasoline. In 93 the government owned 74 companies. Now they own over 500. I don't see any countries where socialism has succeeded. I don't count countries like Denmark and Sweden as socialist because they don't seize the means of production, they are essentially expanded welfare states with a free market economy. To top it all off, the corruption is blatant, and they use their policies to extort people into voting for them. You live in government housing? If you vote against them they will kick you out. You want that cheap food? You don't get it unless you vote for the government. Socialism doesn't make sense, it is evil, it breeds corruption and it brings death, poverty and crime. Change my view!

People vote don’t even tend to vote because of their political beliefs. A lot of them vote because their parents or grandparents already voted for that party or because they have family or friends that are related to a party or political group. 

It’s similar to debating to conspiracy theorists, they will move the goalposts if they have to. You can’t debate with the majority of people because they won’t change their views. 

FOR EXAMPLE: Somebody that is pro or against abortion won’t change their views because of a good argument, they will change it if they have to live through it.

CMV:CMV: Why do we have to bail out airlines? the planes and infrastructure won't disappear.

CMV: Harry Potter has an awful magic system which severely weakens the plot,2122,439,2017-01-20 11:40:03,"**READ THIS**

~~Hey folks this is a really cool conversation, I am enjoying hearing your points of view! But I have to go to bed now, shit's late.
I will pick up on replying to more of these and continuing this sometime tomorrow after my lectures~~


EDIT #2: 

Holy shit this has exploded, I never expected this to get as big as it has. I am slowly working my way through the different arguments. 

It seems very evident that I failed to highlight the main point of my argument, as people are diving into semantics arguments focusing on specific side points to the overall message. 

The basis of what I am arguing is better explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5p1lo2/cmv_harry_potter_has_an_awful_magic_system_which/dcnscwx/?st=iy61scrc&sh=0f2eab35).

EDIT #3: Everyone and their grandmother is getting held up on the wandless magic point, referencing pottermore and the later books where that is established, but that was just a symptom of the overall issue I have with the series which is better outlined in that comment and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/5p1lo2/cmv_harry_potter_has_an_awful_magic_system_which/dcnt1fz/?st=iy62qdsp&sh=cd2cbe73) as well (Last half of that comment). 

There may be arguments that convince me already on the post, but due to how complex these posts are its taking me some time to get through and evaluate them all. 

Thanks!

Hey there, so to start things off, yes Harry Potter is a good story, I am a fan of the book series overall, but this issue is a major gripe for me.

Second, I have not read the books recently, this is a thought holdout that I've had for years.

----
I love stories that set out the rules for a magic system, and then navigate their plots through that system while keeping it consistent. 

A couple examples of a consistent magic system are Eragon and The Kingkiller Chronicles. On the macro scale both of these systems are very similar, the magic that happens is rooted in an energy balance. 

In KC, you can light a cigarette by taking energy from your own body, or a nearby fire, etc. which will then cool as a result. And the further away something is, the higher the cost.

In Eragon, all actions require a similar energy, its a bit more ethereal than KC, but still has very defined limits. Users can't do very much before they are exhausted, so they need to draw on sources of power such as other people, or stored potential energy that was previously harvested.

The point is that, these relationships are established early on in the book series, and while characters refine their abilities, and learn more about the magic system, the base rules continue to apply. 

---
In Harry Potter, the rules are laid out in some of the initial magic lessons, but as the series progress, almost everything that has been established gets thrown away. 

Even worse, in many cases whole plot devices are reliant on just some new form of magic that the reader had no idea was a possibility. 

- Exceptional spell pronunciation and precise wand movement is explained to be essential for a spell to function at all, but then later we end up losing the pronunciation and wand movement entirely. Magic can just happen wordlessly and without a wand.  

- There's essentially no limit to a magic users abilities once you figure out a spell for the first time. You could cast Avada Kedavra all day long. 

- Magic detection is entirely inconsistent. They can use the ""trace"" to detect *any* magic from someone underage *anywhere*, but can't at all tell when someone in the middle of the Ministry of Magic in under a Polyjuice potion? What is this huge magic detection network that allows the ""trace"" to work? How is it not being used for other things?

- Spells have a mind of their own, ala Accio and Crucio

- Incredibly overpowered items like the Time-turner effectively break the universe

I remember having other examples but it has been a while since I read the books.

(EDIT: Bolded this for emphasis, this is the thesis of my argument.)


**In summary,
to me, it feels like JK wrote herself in to corners fairly often and then had to default to ""Because magic"" as the solution. It really irritated me when I read the series for the first time, and I have never been convinced otherwise by friends when Harry Potter gets brought up.**

CMV: There's no reason why any American citizen should be allowed to own automatic or semiautomatic guns.,2122,2098,2017-11-06 20:34:41,"I'm not talking about shotguns, revolvers, or long rifles. I understand the biggest concern for gun owners is a) being able to hunt and b) being able to protect your home/self. I'm fine with both of these things. However, allowing Americans to purchase guns that were specifically designed to kill other people will only perpetuate more acts of mass murder like we seem to have every single week now.

CMV: If you are an hourly worker you owe the company you work for the 40 hours they pay you and nothing more.,2117,407,2019-06-06 21:32:34,"There's an idea that's pervasive in employment that you and your coworkers are a family and that you should be passionate about working there which can mean eating lunch at your desk and working through lunch so that hopefully they see you as good enough to let you stay, as opposed to getting some sort of promotion or raise, or that you stay after hours for free. I see all of this as way for employers to subtly take advantage of their employees while owing them nothing in return. Simultaneously there's this relatively new understanding that employees are all on their own, that they cannot expect their employers to be looking out for them or their interests. Again, employers wanting you thinking about what's best for the company, but it's a one way street as they will not be looking out for you.

I see this sort of behavior from the employer as very bad for the employee and that people in this situation should start collectively adopting the mindset that they owe their company the hours that they pay them, and nothing more. This is especially true if you are working extra so that maybe your employer will ""let you stay"" as if it's some sort of privilege to be working at their company as opposed to some sort of hope that they will be promoted. You should not feel obligated to give them any extra work beyond what they are paying you in that scenario.",1
"CMV: Being attracted to certain races exclusively is not racist, just as homosexuals being attracted to one sex is not sexist.",2114,913,2018-09-23 21:40:56,"I’ve often seen many post here saying “I wouldn’t date __________ race and it’s not racist.” However, this is often immediately dismissed and racism is called out quickly. While it is true that many of the arguments presented are faulty, that is because SEXUAL PREFERENCE IS SUBJECTIVE. For the same reason that homosexuals are only attracted to the same sex, some straight people are only attracted to certain races. So to accuse one of bigotry, one must accuse the other.

Is there anything I’m missing here? If so, change my view.

Edit: Wow, I really didn’t expect this to do too well. Unfortunately I’m not able to address everyone, but a common misconception people have about my post is that said attraction is subjective because it can change. That is not my claim. A homosexual persons sexual preferences are not “objective” because they are biologically determined. It is objectively true THAT they are attracted to the same sex due to biology, however, their attraction to said sex is still subjective.",1
"CMV: Organ donation should be ""opt out"", not ""opt in"", in the U.S",2113,350,2017-04-30 09:13:36,"In the U.S, organ donation is an option that people must select to participate in when they are getting a license or ID. The default setting is that everyone is ""opted out"" of the organ donation program and must actively choose to have their organs donated after their death. Instead of allowing people to ""opt in"" to organ donation, I believe the U.S. should make organ donation the default because it will result in more people donating their organs.

From a psychological standpoint, humans tend to gravitate towards decisions that have already been made for them. It is easier to go along with a premade decision than it is to change it. By requiring people to sign up for organ donation, the U.S. makes it unnecessarily difficult (albeit not that much) to be an organ donor.

In addition, the ""opt out"" policy has proven to get more people being organ donators than the ""opt in"" system. Stanford discussed this [here](https://sparq.stanford.edu/solutions/opt-out-policies-increase-organ-donation), where they looked at Austria, a country that by default has everyone signed up as an organ donor. This results in around 90% of people donating their organs, compared with the ~15% donation rate in the U.S. 

There is a huge demand for organs in the U.S. to help save the lives of thousands of people. Many of these people are put on waiting lists but die before an organ is made available for them. The U.S. could potentially change this, or at least alleviate it, by adopting an ""opt out"" policy for organ donation.

Edit:
/u/cosmicr pointed out that the country referenced in the Stanford article was Austria, not Australia.

CMV: The Walking Dead isn't that good.,2112,276,2017-11-11 21:33:03,"First, let me admit there's incredible episodes such as Conquer, Last Day On Earth and The Same Boat and that the show isn't terrible.    
My main problem with with it it's that it's BORING. A gigantic part of it is characters being emotional and giving monotonous (sometimes incomprehensible) speeches or figthing with each other instead of things actually happening, and there's another gigantic part of the show that shit sorta happens but there's no tension, like when the walkers came for Alexandria or the barn.      
There's a reason for this, yeah, the show is trying to be realistic, but the point of fiction is not to create another reality with maximmum acuraccy to our reality, it's to create a more interesting reality than ours. Our world is boring as shit.        
The show is also predictable. The group finds a settlement, shit happens and a lot of people die, Rick magically saves everybody and recruits new people on his crew, cycle repeats. The new people on his crew are probably boring as fuck, like Noah or Deanna, and they're mostly the ones that die. This is made so that the show can kill a shitton of people, and still avoid killing characters enjoyed by the public.    
Another unpopular opinion, while we are at that, by the way: Shane is one of the best characters in the show and he was MOSTLY right, except for almost raping Lori.

CMV: Draft dodging is perfectly reasonable and ethical under Trump,2106,1185,2020-01-04 21:52:11,"When a country goes to war it must be done for justice and done so wisely. When a citizen looks at the justification/wisdom of a war they must admit there are often a number of hard to determine variables such as the probability that a peaceful solution could work and the probability that there are ulterior motives of their leaders. 

So, when one looks at an individual like Trump, what does one see? What you see is man who is very poor at critical thinking (lacks wisdom) and is very unethical with likely ulterior motives (lacks virtue of justice). 

(((Just in case you need a little evidence Trump is a poor critical thinker: https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-conspiracy-theories-2016-5 )))

Therefore, one is foolish to risk their life or kill on the command of someone who lacks the virtue to make a wise or just decision about other's lives. Just because an elected leader asks you to fight doesn't mean there is an obligation to fight. People who hold power mostly use the rest of us as cannon fodder for their own hopes and dreams which have nothing to do with the good of the people. If you like being alive and not killing people, screw the leadership, especially when it's someone like Trump!!!!",1
CMV:North America should legalize prostitution to keep sex workers safe.,2104,343,2018-03-25 23:34:00,"Legalizing prostitution will create a safer environment for sex workers and its consumers. With legalization there will be safety standards and regulations including annual health check ups which will lower the spread of STDs. It will also eliminate the criminal elements of prostitution such as physical abuse to sex workers from pimps and consumers. With proper permits this should also prevent the trafficking of sex slaves. Having a governing body will also make it harder for anyone underage to get into prostitution (identification & permits required). Legalizing prostitution will shed light on the negative stigmas around it and give sex workers their civil and labour rights as a person and as a worker. 

Sex work may not be an ideal job for many people; however, those who choose to be in this industry should still have the same labour rights. 


EDIT ---

Decriminalization over legalization, but still maintain the position of not illegal out right.

The effects that SC had on the mental health of the prisoner is very well documented, as well as the increase in physical and sexual abuse from guards. Locking someone up for 22-24 hours a day with no contact with other people and no stimulants is cruel. Sadly, in the US it’s not that “unusual” given that there are over 80,000 prisoners in SC today. I have seen no evidence that locking someone up in SC for extended periods in anyway assists in the rehabilitation of a prisoner. It deteriorates the psychiatric condition of  the inmate and does not work as a long term deterrent. I have also seen statistics that say [states that decrease their use of solitary confinement see significant decreases in prison violence. ](http://princetonspear.com/7x9-fact-sheet)Solitary confinement also disproportionately affects African Americans, members of the LGBT, religious minority, and the mentally ill.  

So we have the 8th amendent violations that SC encompass, SC is shown to not be effective and the decrease in its use has many positive effects, and it disproportionately affects minorities. On a totally different area, the costs of SC  can reach $77,000 or higher per prisoner.

That's so uncreative, there's almost nothing special or unique about him. He just has it all, which makes it almost redundant for him to be in the Justice League (he has most of the other members' powers and is stronger than all of them combined). He has little to no personality, or at least a very boring one, and is such a bland and unrelatable character. Even when I was a little kid and had no standards at all, Superman still didn't interest me. I always watched the Batman, Spider-Man, X-Men and Justice League cartoons, but always skipped the Superman cartoon. I just didn't care for it. That's why there hasn't been a good live-action Superman film since 1978, despite all the other big-name superheroes (Batman, Spider-Man, Wonder Woman, Iron Man, Captain America, X-Men, etc.) each having fantastic movies within the past decade.

CMV: Leaving ad newspapers in someone's driveway or sticking your ad in someone's house door should be considered littering and a punishable crime.,2081,259,2018-08-03 21:19:18,"**Newspaper/Magazine Bundles:**

I am currently not subscribed to any sort of newspaper or magazine service, yet I get a newspaper bundle or magazine bundle wrapped in a plastic bag thrown into my driveway at least once a week. Sometimes it's in a spot I don't see right away because it's dark when I get home or because it's on the edge of my driveway and lawn. So at least once a week, I have to go out there and pick up what is essentially garbage off my property and throw it in the trash. Then I wonder how long it was there making my house look bad.

&nbsp;

**Door Ads:**

I also tend to get a lot of people shoving adds into the crack between my door and door frame. This can be anything from local restaurants, to local churches, to lawn service ads despite my lawn obviously already looking well-maintained. Many times these don't stay in the door and end up blown by the wind into my flower bed or yard only to sometimes not be noticed until they have been degraded by the wind and rain. And just like the newspaper, I have to go out there and clean up the trash that someone *intentionally* placed on my property.

&nbsp;

I understand that people have had varying degrees of success in calling these companies and asking them to leave you alone, but it shouldn't be allowed in the first place. I shouldn't have to call someone and ask them to not leave trash on my property. Leaving behind paper and plastic products along the side of the road is litter, why is it allowed to happen on my property? I think leaving these unwanted ads in someone's yard, driveway, or door should be considered littering and a punishable offense, CMV.

"CMV: Religion is the biggest cause of problems in the world today, and it should be treated much like conspiracy theories.",2083,460,2018-12-27 12:38:12,"Okay, goodbye Karma.

Now first off, I am still in support for freedom of religion. I believe that to take away freedom of religion is to take away freedom of thought, and that would be a horrific crime. There is too much of this Orwellian intent to take away our thoughts. The extreme left thinks it should be criminal to dislike a certain group, whereas the extreme right things it should be criminal to be gay.

In light of this, I don't advocate in any way laws that restrict religion unless your religion affects other people. There should be no political outing of religion. But here's the unpopular bit, so get your downvotes ready.

Religion should be stigmatized. It should be treated at least with the ridicule that conspiracy theorists face and at most with the hatred with which we treat racists and homophobes.

Religion is the root of so many problems, through one catalyst. Religion has blinded many to the notion of critical thinking and science. We, as a society, are too reliant on pseudoscience and plain ignorance. The far right in America is packed with people who don't believe in climate change, and the left is filled with people who don't support modern medicine. Fanaticism and pseudoscience is rife in today's society, and it seems only to come from religion and indoctrination. Now, many people were raised by atheists, and in a way were ""taught"" atheism. This did not come from critical thinking, and is just as accidental as being raised religions and sticking with it, so there are many atheists that are not the scientific, freethinking humanists you hear about on [r/atheism](https://old.reddit.com/r/atheism).

Religion is in direct conflict with science, and it is building a divide between those raised by religion and those raised without. I believe that, without religion, we would be a more scientifically driven society, and we would benefit greatly in many regards. Education would benefit from it, climate change would be a primary political focus, and we would be a more tolerant society in regards to that which isn't crazy, like religion.

Here's another reason why it's religion that's holding us back.

Imagine a political party comprised of the most accomplished physicists, chemists, engineers, sociologists, psychologists etc.

I'm talking like if Brian Cox, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, Bill Nye and the likes formed a party where their agenda would be a response to problems in both social science and natural science. Why is this good? Because scientists have a certain mindset. Scientists care about the truth, and only the truth. They don't care nearly as much about manipulating people, they don't care about becoming rich. If they cared about becoming rich they wouldn't have stayed at university for that long, they would have dropped out after their Master's and got a job as an engineer (well, Bill Nye did that after his Bachelor's but he's still better than Trump or Hilary)

So why wouldn't this work? Because America is over 70% Christian, according to census, and I'm sure a lot of them would hate the idea of an atheistic government. There is no way that party could be elected into power at all, in basically any country. And it's for that reason that I know this post is going to get a fair bit of shit from both the religious and the blind atheists that think the key to happiness for all is letting everyone perpetuate their myths. Freedom of religion is politically necessary, but religion itself is the biggest issue on today's society.",1
"CMV: As a white, heterosexual male, I don't feel wanted or welcome by the Left and am nervous to vote for a Leftist candidate.",2076,749,2018-08-06 00:30:40,"EDIT: Thank you all for your feedback, and I'm really sorry if I'm slow to respond. I'm trying to listen to everybody, but you're all writing interesting and long-thought-out posts so it's becoming increasingly difficult. I just want to clarify for the new readers: I've basically yielded that ""white"" is not really an important word in my prompt. There isn't much I describe below that singles out white men. It's more of a men thing in general. I also want to clarify that I am almost entirely determined on voting for Blue candidates this fall; the prompt should be read as ""I'm begrudgingly voting Blue for sure, but worried that Blue doesn't care about me."" Many of you have already expressed that this is a systemic shortcoming of a two-party system - not necessarily a specific targeting or lack thereof. Thank you all for your input, and I'll try my best to continue replying.

EDIT 2: Guys, I'm really sorry - this blew up to an extent far greater than I can respond to. I'm not trying to ignore newer posts, and I'm sure there are others who are lurking to read what you have to say, but I'm getting flooded here. I'm very thankful for that, but it also means most of you probably won't see a reply from me! I'm very sorry. Haven't had a CMV post this large before - had no idea how overwhelming it can get. Thank you for all of your different perspectives!! It helps a lot :)

To some, this probably sounds like the most ""privileged"" post you've ever heard. To you I'd say, I'm sorry because I'm really not trying to upset anybody, but rather express a frustration. I very dearly want to vote against the Republican party come this midterm. Just for a quick snapshot of my political opinions:

* I want tighter tax doctrine imposed upon corporations and the wealthy, coupled with lower taxes for sub-median income groups. I want overseas funds to return from these corporations.
* I want a political party that doesn't take corporate handouts (hahahahahaha) and doesn't spit on the likes of the homeless.
* I want socialized healthcare and socialized higher education.
* I want nuclear energy with supplemental wind, solar, hydroelectric, and geothermal.
* I want LGBTQ+ to feel as welcome and wanted in this country as the rest of us.
* I want a clear pathway to citizenship that gets everybody paying their taxes and able to access affordable healthcare and the other perks of citizenship. I want the children of the immigrant families returned, and I want the people in charge of the horrible shit that has happened to them brought to justice.
* I want a foreign policy that is warm and trusting of the EU / NATO and stand-offish against Russia.
* I want men and women to continue to step forward to unveil the horrible sexual scandals that have been occurring in the entertainment industry and elsewhere. I want these pieces of shit brought to light, and I am happy to see a guilty person's entertainment career torched because of how they treated their coworkers and the general public.

I can continue, but I just want to get the point across that I really do intend to vote for a left-leaning candidate. However, my frustration is that I do not feel welcome by this party:

* Most recent Democratic presidential candidates, including Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama, have been guilty of using the same 77-cents-on-the-dollar statistic to describe a problem that has nothing to do with 77-cents-on-the-dollar. Clinton and Obama both have discussed in their respective campaigns troubling statistics such as suicide rates or incarceration of women, while glossing over how disproportionately fucked men are in these categories. Politicians and citizens try to assign discrete ""weight"" to every social issue; the issues facing white men can go on the backburner or be ignored because someone else has it ""worse.""
* No Democratic candidate in the past two general elections, to my knowledge, has ever summoned statistics, such as the suicide gap, the horrendous state of U.S. divorce and custody trials, the terrifying way in which a false rape accusation for a college / graduate student likely means the end of their career, domestic violence against men / lack of public resource available to help abused men, etc.. If they ever said something about problems like this, my guess is that they said it in passing, sandwiched between a statistic about women and a statistic about LGBTQ+. I imagine they avoided these issues because they would (probably correctly) feel that they would be cast out as democratic candidates for failing to pass muster here.
* With Sarah Jeong still holding her seat at the New York Times, and the NYT being a usually left-leaning news source, it's pretty clear that leftist media is not afraid of being racist toward white men. Or at least, they are not afraid of being controversial when it involves white men, but stay away from woman / minority controversies like the plague.
* Any time a white man discusses the issues which are specific to white men, they are considered either racist, redpillers, or both. I think this point is **incredibly dangerous**, because if a left-leaning voter feels cast out by their own party, you know who they want to go to? Jordan Peterson and Ben Shapiro and all of those fuckin guys telling them that they're right to feel frustrated because blahblahblah and then, you know, the far right has their own perpetuated narratives too, and none of it's good. Bernie Sanders was, in my opinion, a very strong, egalitarian candidate. But Hillary Clinton's team, coupled with some bullshit editorials from the WaPo and NYT, calling Bernie supporters ""Bernie Bros"", was all it took to torch his campaign. That is a pathetic weakness for a political candidate on the national stage.
* The republican party has essentially installed a catch-net for any democrats who fall out with their party over controversial social stuff. Trump may be a madman, but if he and his crew are the **only** people talking about the issues that white men face, who the fuck do you want someone who is concerned about the lack of concern for white men to go?

I think a major weakness of the current state of the Democratic party moving forward is that they demand 100% loyalty on social issues and have completely abandoned an organized fiscal or foreign policy plan. Democratic candidates can rise and fall in an instant depending on whether or not they made a rude comment to a secretary during the primaries. But if Clinton feels hawkish against Russia or wants to abandon / trash some key trade deals, that's all fine according to her voters. As long as she talks about wage gaps, she can be whatever type of diplomat she wants. A major strength of the current state of the Republican party is that they've leveraged themselves in such a way as to capture dissent within the Democratic party, when voters inevitably fall out.

I just want a candidate that gives equal airtime to *every* demographic's issues. I want someone who acknowledges that everyone has major fucking problems and not try to continue a narrative that the furthers the goals of a particular group only. The Left does a very good job recognizing the bullshit lies and narratives that the Right commits against their own voters, but are you fully aware of the shit happening in your own party? Do you want to see what happens in a court when a female teacher has relations with a male student? Do you want to see what happens when a virgin with a 4.0 at Harvard gets accused of raping a woman? I understand that you need to say some things to appeal to each voterbase, right? So if you make a pit stop and give a 1 hour speech in a Hispanic community, you need to make mention of some Hispanic community issues and what you plan to do to fix them. That's just what makes good political sense. Where is the Democrat candidate making the same appeal to men? Do they care? Are we supposed to accept that nobody gives a shit that men get wrecked disproportionately in divorce cases, false rape accusations, occupy the majority of prison cells, and are the majority of homeless?

Never underestimate the voting plurality of white men - old men, divorced men, bored men. Picture this voter: a man is on the hook for child support, often times even when the woman earns more money. A man fails in the majority of custody cases. His life has been ripped away by a vengeful woman. He is pushed into a deep depressive state with suicidal urges. He hears from the WaPo how female suicide rates are ""rising"", while not a peep about men or how close he was to pulling the trigger yesterday. He hears from Vox how the patriarchy does mysterious (dare I say, deep state?) type shit, all the while a woman and a female judge just took his life away. Where the fuck do you expect him to vote? There's a Red candidate, who's a little extreme on guns, mind you, but he's the only one who told him *his problems matter*.

I don't want this to be a red midterm, and lord willing it isn't going to be, but for fuck's sake people, how many more times do I have to hear the same BS statistics to further the same BS narrative, all the while scoffing at how the Right uses BS statistics to further the same BS narrative?",1
CMV: The metric system is objectively better and there is no advantage to the imperial system over metric system.,2076,1037,2018-04-24 16:15:57,"**Edit:** This blew up. Please read the disclaimer before posting (many people clearly skipped that), also I apologize for not being able to respond to everyone, my answers may seem a little rushed (because they are). I will try to get to everyone with decent arguments later (I am sorry for this arrogant sentence but I can't respond to all arguments, I will focus on the decent ones). 

Disclaimer: I am talking about all types of units in the imperial system (inch, foot, lb, oz) and metric system (metre, liter, kilogram), not just one in particular (while it is mostly aimed at weight and length units). The cost of changing from the imperial system to the metric system is not a part of this argument, because that is not an argument in favor of the system, but in favor of not changing it. Indeed the cost would be very high and most likely only worth it in the very long run.

_____

I think that there is literally no job that the imperial system has which is not done better by the metric system.

1. The metric system is easier to work with, as it has a 10-base system.

2. Since the metric system has a 10-base system, it is very easy to convert units into other units (not just hierarchically, but you can also convert volume units into weight units, etc.)

3. People often argue that it is easier to ""imagine"" the imperial system because it works with human feet, inch etc. Which is hardly true, since the average foot length depends on gender and genetics. The error that you make by assuming the length of eg. a rope is equal to the error you make by assuming the same lenght in metres (considering you are accustomed to the units) - that is considering the average foot length differs by 2,5 cm from the actual foot unit length, and the variation in the population is huge (even though normally distributed).

4. The imperial units themselves are defined in metric units, because otherwise, you would have no way of telling the exact size of each unit.

5. Most science in the US and UK is done in the metric units anyway, because they are much easier to work with.

Therefore, I think that it is not only objectively better (because it posesses advantages I listed and possibly more), but that the imperial system has actually not a single factor in which it would be better than the metric system (and therefore is subpar). Thus, changing my view can either be accomplished with good arguments against the advantages of the metric system, or by presenting an argument that the imperial system actually has advantages and/or something the metric system cannot bring.

CMV: The names of mass shooters should not be released to the public.,2073,211,2017-10-03 18:38:03,"I feel like in many cases, most notably the Columbine, mass shooters do what they do for some sort of infamy. Whether they are dead or not after the fact they know that their name will live on. They become some sort of celebrity in the world of psychopaths and that plays into why they do what they do. 

If their names aren't recognized, they can't get the recognition they want.

CMV: Poutine should be declared the national dish of Canada.,2073,401,2019-10-26 00:57:59,"Ok, so Trudeau is in a minority now, and needs some feel good pablum to fill Parliamentary time while he treads water before the next election.  What better than a bill about a national dish!

Poutine is the perfect candidate for national dish of Canada, for a few reasons:

1. **It is distinctly Canadian.**  A relatively recent innovation, it post-dates confederation and is not an import from elsewhere.

2. **It is widely popular in Canada.**  There are specialized poutine restaurants from coast to coast.  You can get super fancy poutines at some of Canada's [most famous restaurants.](https://www.theworlds50best.com/discovery/Au-Pied-de-Cochon.html) And you can get cheap poutine approximately everywhere.

3. **It is delicious.**

4. **It helps to bridge regional divides.** The paramount cultural and regional division in Canada is the Anglo/French divide.  Poutine is a Quebecois dish adopted by the rest of Canada, but still universally recognized for its Quebec origins.  It is a paramount example of successful integration of Quebec into Canada without the loss of Quebec culture.

*Edit: I've given a bunch of deltas on regional strife questions.  Any further deltas will need to be on different bases from that.*",1
CMV: Colleges guilty of participating in the admissions scandal should refund application fees.,2070,113,2019-03-21 01:11:34,"Note: I am not a lawyer so forgive the sometimes not-quite-right phrasing/terminology.

First, I want to categorize the two types of admission scandals: college-enabled and non-college-enabled. By college-enabled, I mean the scandals involving bribing coaches of various sports or directly bribing other school officials to gain entrance into the university. By non-college-enabled, I'm referring to the other scandals (which I believe are a majority of the cases involved) involving doctors diagnosing disabilities, test-center supervisors adjusting scores, and things of that nature.

Next, I want to define guilty: colleges that have officials (coaches, admissions officers, etc.) who are *convicted* in the upcoming trials of skewing admissions for personal gain. Not just those accused - innocent until proven guilty and all.

I want to establish a few assumptions:
1) That, when I pay a (frankly) ridiculous amount of money to be considered at a school like Georgetown, I expect the considerations to be *fair under their criteria*; I may disagree with those criteria (ex. the weight of an in person interview, prioritization/requirement of standardized tests, or whether they prefer weighted/unweighted GPAs) but I am entering into a good-faith agreement (again, NAL) that those criteria will be applied. 
2) That a school takes responsibility when the faults of its staff are not caught by the appropriate systems. You can sue a school for butchering a title 9 investigation, or if they failed to run background checks and one of their employees harasses you. The extension of this assumption is that a school is at fault if their employees are taking bribes to rig school-processes and there either A) are no checks in place or B) are not caught by existing checks.
3) That a university has a “soft limit” of how many applicants they can accept. This limit is variable and open to exceptions (“We can squeeze another 15 in because they’re just so awesome) BUT there *is* a maximum. 
4) Universities do not maintain a historical list ranking applicants. IE there is no way to say “if we had 5 more slots, these 5 people would have gotten in when they applied in 2012.” Footnote at the bottom if this is false.

Assuming that these individuals are found guilty of accepting bribes in the year [arbitrary year represented by 20XX]:
I see no reason why universities should not return the initial application fees to those who applied in 20XX. Their people abused the system just as much as those doing the bribing; the honest applicants are the real victims. If 15 people bribed their way into “Generic College University,” then 15 people were not accepted because of illicit activities. Given that it is not possible to determine who those 15 are, all who were slighted – the entire applying class – are at a loss. Thus, instead of pursuing damages (hard to prove, potentially immeasurable) from not getting in, the schools should simply refund application fees. We paid for a service (considering our applications fairly) and the service was not delivered. 

Footnote if assumption 4 is false: The argument stands, but then those specific people who would have gotten in deserve the refund, not the entire applying class. IE 15 bribed their way in, refund the 15 who would have gotten in. Also – in this scenario, punitive damages for the difference in wages, skills, etc. would still be difficult to calculate, but would be much more manageable due to the smaller scale.

CMV: There needs to be more political diversity and different opinions on Reddit.,2061,1051,2020-01-06 23:29:33,"Repost because I fell asleep and couldn’t respond to comments.
CMV:
Scrolling through r/worldpolitics, r/news, r/politics is disappointing. The vast majority of posts or articles are extremely left leaning, all the comments say a specific right wing figure is a demon which ultimately creates a sort of bubble inside of reddit itself with little to no differing views, such as my own. As someone who identifies as libertarian with right leaning views, I now completely avoid politics on Reddit because there is nothing that I believe in. For example r/Democrats has many times more followers than r/GOP. For the record I think Fox is an opinion/talk show channel, while CNN is hysterical and unfounded most of the time. What Reddit needs is differing opinions that go against the mainstream “trump is hitler.”

"CMV: The Marvel Cinematic Universe has done disservice to Hulk as [he should be] ""the strongest"" superhero.",2049,327,2019-04-24 01:00:21,"Edit: Do all threads that reference movies get labeled “spoiler”. The most recent movie mentioned in this post is *Infinity War* (not *Endgame*). 

Although I am a long-time/old-school comic reader (I'm over 50; I loved comics in the late 70s through to the mid 90s), I'm looking at this from just within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

Hulk, as a superhero, has the drawback of not always being his super-powered self. He's normally Bruce Banner -- not a fighter, even on a human scale like Black Widow and Hawkeye. Also, when he is his super-powered self, he's a loose canon, barely on the side of the good guys. This is a pretty serious drawback when compared to the other super-powered heroes, who are pretty much always their super-powered self, with their normal mind/personality. Even Tony Stark can essentially become Iron Man quickly enough to respond to an ambush since his second movie. Since after *Avengers* (Hulk's first MCU movie), Banner changing to Hulk has been difficult and unreliable. And even succeeding removes Banner's mind.

Hulk's physical strength is pretty much his signature super-power. He's the pinnacle for his very narrow niche. He's ""the strongest Avenger"". The one the others have to struggle to even stalemate -- like Thor vs. Hulk in the original *Avengers*. But since his first showing (where his power level and niche was ""baselined""), and his first superhero vs. superhero fight (TvH, where it was demonstrated), he's become less impressive. He has become ""[The Worf Effect](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWorfEffect)"" trope for the MCU.

In *Age of Ultron*, Tony Stark in the Hulkbuster armor beat Hulk to unconsciousness. (Also knocked one of Hulk's teeth out.) That fight should have ended, in the building rubble (as he was), with Hulk coming out of Scarlet Witch's mind influence (as he did), seeing the situation (as he did), and calming down and turning back into Bruce Banner. Instead of Iron Man one punching him lights out. Right up to that moment was great showing that even the best/strongest Tony Stark technology (with Banner's help) was still only able to stalemate Hulk. The result (a guilt-ridden Banner on the quinjet) would have been the same. But instead, we get the MCU ""smartest"" man beat the ""strongest"" man with strength. 

Then in *Infinity War*, Thanos handily beats Hulk in a physical strength fight. Hulk was showing his signature brutal strength in the first few seconds of the fight, but then Thanos overpowers him hand/arm strength vs. hand/arm strength. I'm OK with Thanos being the better-skilled fighter (makes sense), and even eventually winning (through calm experience and skill vs. raging strength brawling), but if the MCU wants Hulk to really be the pinnacle example of rage strength (as I think he should be), Thanos should have had to use the Power Infinity Stone. I mean, that was the one and only stone he literally had on his gauntlet at that time -- showing the stone glowing could have kept the fight result the same, but would have kept Hulk's position as ""the strongest"" (non-Infinity Stone user; Cheater! ;-) and shown an Infinity Stone being used (useful for something other than The Snap) and wouldn't have taken away any ""badass"" points away from Thanos.

Then later in this same movie, Bruce wearing the Hulkbuster armor comments that the suit had ""already kicked the crap out of the Hulk."" No one/thing should ever be able to say they ""kicked the crap out of the Hulk"" (without an Infinity Stone cheat ;-). ""Fought against,"" ""Survived against,"" even ""Challenged,"" sure. But the Hulk should be the one who ""kicked the crap out of"" anyone.

To CMV, explain how repeatedly beating Hulk doesn't reduce him to The Worf Effect. Explain how beating Hulk doesn't undermine his terror (that Natasha showed in *Avengers*). Explain how having Hulk get repeatedly beaten in contests of raw raging strength, especially beaten to unconsciousness, (instead of ending fights like I suggest above) improves the MCU and the characters who did the beating.

Note: Lest anyone take this long post as an overly-serious obsessed fanboy rant. Although I have always enjoyed Hulk comics (80s-90s), he was never my favorite superhero^t . But I do really like the symbol he represents: The unstoppable force of raw, rage strength. The MCU started with Hulk as this, but it disappoints me that they've decided to Worf Effect him. Come on, Marvel, stop throwing this wonderful legendary monument under the bus just to make other characters climb the power creep mountain. (How many metaphors did I just mangle?)

^t My favorites were usually the lower power level heroes like Captain America, Wolverine, Spider-Man, and Punisher (even though I also collected and read many of the more powerful heroes like Iron Man, Thor, and yes, Hulk.",1
"CMV: If I've already purchased a band's CD in the past, I don't feel bad pirating a digital version.",2054,560,2018-01-20 00:43:45,"Compact discs are basically obsolete, and over the past 25 years I've purchased most albums from all my favorite bands. Given that the technology has evolved, and the artist has already received payment for their work via CD royalties, I often pirate a digital version of an album for which I already own the CD (which is sitting in the basement collecting dust). I do not possess a computer capable of ripping the CD into digital format. 

I only pirate music that I have previously paid for, and I don't feel that I'm denying the artist additional income since I would not be re-purchasing the digital album via iTunes.  

To CMV I would be interested to hear about your experiences with music technology, and the morals behind re-purchasing music you already own in a different format. In that scenario, I wouldn't be paying the artist for their music, I'd be paying the industry for a new listening format.

"CMV: Abortion is preferable to raising a child on an unstable financial foundation, and it shouldn't be regulated on a federal level.",2055,558,2017-08-07 02:34:31,"I'd consider myself mostly conservative, but still have some rather liberal ideas and this is one of them. Abortion has always been a really tough issue for me and I used to oppose it until I had a pregnancy scare with my SO. We were only 19 and her period was late. I was terrified, praying to the heavens to not have a child this early, that I'm not ready. Luckily, she got it eventually. But I'll never forget that heart-sinking feeling in my chest and it's made me a lot more empathetic towards those who get abortions.

However, I'd still like to hear all angles of this argument. Most conservative commentators don't go beyond ""it's killing babies and Jesus"" and seems to be the one issue where facts aren't brought into question. So for those who are against it, please shed insight that isn't religiously-related. For those who are Pro-Life, I'd love to hear your perspective on this and answer these points:

1. Unintended pregnancy rates for those below the poverty line are extremely high compared to higher-income families, but abortion keeps that rate *somewhat* stable so that it doesn't reach unintended birth. I believe that having a child prematurely in the midst of poor economic standing is the root of a LOT of our societal problems. Most conservatives also hate how many are on welfare, and I'd bet that many of those on it are due to having children prematurely. **Why is abortion a worse outcome than raising a kid in the midst of personal financial turmoil?**

2. Teens are notoriously promiscuous with all the hormones raging during that age, many losing their virginity at age 13-14. Even with contraceptives like condoms and birth control, accidents can happen. **What would you suggest to a person pregnant in High School, if not abortion? Should she really (potentially) suffer throughout her entire life with this mistake she made as a reckless teen, even if she used contraceptives?**

3. **At what point in pregnancy does it become a ""life"" and why?** Some conservatives believe that it's a child at the MOMENT of conception. **Does this mean that Plan B is just at immoral as abortion? Would you compromise or make exceptions for early stages of pregnancy?**

4. As I've said, even with contraceptives, accidents can still happen. Sex is a huge driving force in our lives and we don't really notice how strongly our libido impacts our decision-making. **What could possibly be a solution to this major problem of unintended pregnancy?** Pre-marital sex is just not viable, an unrealistic goal.


5. Conservatives usually oppose a strong federal government that can regulate a person's life choices, such as wearing seatbelts. **Do you believe abortion should be illegally mandated all across the nation, or is it a states' right issue, and why?**

6. I know this is an extremely rare margin of abortion cases, but **what would you suggest for rape victims? Surely they shouldn't be forced to care for a child that they had no choice in preventing, right?**


Looking forward to reading these answers!

CMV: Editorials should be excluded from search engine 'News' results.,2051,91,2018-12-13 02:02:55,"There is an important difference between an editorial and news. Although the line may be hard to define, news should always, ideally, be fact based reporting while editorials (or punditry) should consist of analysis. A good editorial shouldn't misstate or misrepresent facts but the viewer or reader may disagree with the opinion stated. Conversely, a good news article should be fairly hard to dispute.

The reason I bring this up is because I heard some rumblings about whistle blowers coming forward about the Clinton foundation and possible tax law violations. Given the conspiracy community's infatuation with the Clinton hearsay as well as the fact they are a constant scapegoat for the right, I am very wary of editorials about them and much prefer straight news. 

Yet when I search for news on the subject all I get are editorials which are not held to a good standard of truthfullness.

Given the problem with fake news pervading our society, I suspect many casual news readers don't readily differentiate between the two. So here's what I think:

1. Editorials should be very CLEARLY described as opinion pieces by the organization.

2. NEWS searches shouldn't include editorials. Either they should get a separate tab or just come up in general searches. 

CMV


EDIT:

I have to go proctor a final so I won't be able to reply for a while.

I think the best argument, which was presented pretty consistently from different users, is that this type of change would probably just lead to news organizations editorializing their news stories even more.

Plenty of users presented pretty good points about how bias can present itself even in 'news' that contains only facts, but may bend the truth with omissions or lack of proper context. I think this is a good point but doesn't really address the question.

My key idea was to put a more distinct divide between op-eds and news sections even though the news may have some bias in theory it will be better than op-eds from the same organization in terms of neutrality. It isn't supposed to be a perfect solution but maybe a step in the right direction. Also many users seemed to think I wanted to censor op-eds. On the contrary I think they should be just as readily available as the news, just more clearly classified as opinion. 

But this brings us back to the first point in that it could lead to a degradation in the quality of news, which many of us aren't too happy with as is. ",1
CMV: Marketing is an immoral form of manipulation.,2049,298,2019-09-16 22:27:52,"EDIT: I'm talking specifically about direct marketing - the form concerned with making you take an action immediately. Not the sort of ads you would see on TV which are more concerned with brand awareness. More the kind of ads you'd see on Facebook.

Cards on the table - I'm a copywriter, and I struggle with this idea sometimes.

Advertising and marketing rely on agitating people's fears, hopes, and worries to motivate them to take some action that benefits the company doing the marketing.

It abuses flaws in human psychology to manipulate people to do things they would likely never have done otherwise.

The same principles behind it are being used by organisations like Cambridge Analytica to manipulate people's political beliefs to benefit political groups. 

There's a counter-argument I've heard which says that all we do is manipulate each other, in some form, to get what we want. All we do is want things from each other, love, sex, companionship, work, play, art. 

It can be an altruistic want, like wanting your friend to cheer up, or a selfish want, like trying to get a raise from your boss. We say or do what we think will best influence the other person to take the action we want. 

Is it that simple?",1
"CMV: The lack of a ""back"" button on an iPhone is a dealbreaker",2047,246,2017-07-23 22:00:27,"EDIT: My view has not been changed 180 degrees, but it's more nuanced and I now better understand the reasons people have to disliking a 'back' button. The biggest point for me is that while iOS 'back' functions are unintuitive by location (different situations call for different navigation commands/navigation buttons appear in different parts of the screen depending on the app), the Android 'back' button is potentially unintuitive by function (it's always in the same place, but pressing it may do something different from what you expected).

I learned quite a bit about how to use the iOS as well, though some of them yielded more questions than answers (that's another CMV for another day). For now, thanks for your responses!

----------------------

I really hate Apple's design philosophy in general, but since I know my opinion is generally unpopular, I decided to start small and post about one particular design decision - the lack of a back button. Why is the lack of one such a big deal to me?

**It's a waste of space.** One of the biggest selling points of the iPhone when it first came out (and why almost everyone uses touchscreen phones now) is the maximizing of screenspace - the screen takes up almost the entire area of the phone. Nevertheless, almost every app needs a way to go back, so there is a 'back' button onscreen. This takes up valuable screenspace, when there is perfectly fine real estate either side of the home button which isn't doing anything.

**It's inefficient in many situations.** Take this situation: I'm riding shotgun to an appointment and giving directions to the driver. Guy I'm meeting texts to ask if I'm on the way. After replying to his message, I want to go back to my navigation app as quickly as possible to make sure we don't miss a turn, but instead of just pressing the 'back' button, I have to doublepress the home button, find Googlemaps, then tap on it. Seems like a small difference, but it really adds up! Take a more extreme (but still relatively common) scenario:

Someone has just sent me a long email with external links (for reference) interspersed with the text. Every single time I click an external link, I have to take extra steps to return to reading the email - extra steps that wouldn't have been necessary with a back button. Honestly, navigating between apps using the home button makes about as much sense to me as cooking a dish, and exiting and re-entering the kitchen every time I want to add a different ingredient.

**It is unintuitive.** This is my biggest pet peeve because Apple keeps marketing their products as intuitive and easy to use.

Most phones come with a 'back' button that works in *every* situation. It will either take you to the previous menu, or back to the previous app you were using, or back to your home screen. Since there is no 'back' button on iPhones, the 'back' function is worked into the apps, on screen. In most apps, you can find the 'back' button in the top left corner. However, there are many cases in which this isn't the case:

- In Safari, the back button is at the bottom (and you need to scroll upwards for it to even appear).

- When viewing directions in Googlemaps, if you want to return to the map view, you need to 'swipe' the directions out of the way.

- In some apps (Gmail for example), there's no quick way to go back. Say I've checked my inbox and then go to check my spam folder, there is no back button onscreen at all - I need to manually tap 'my folders' and tap 'inbox' from there.

In other words, while in a majority of cases I know that I can find a 'back' button at the top left of the screen, there are also numerous examples where this isn't the case, and there are many situations in which I would need to 'learn' how to do an extremely simple command ('go back').

You might say that these are small inconveniences that no longer are relevant once you get used to it. But the fact remains that they are easily fixed with the addition of a universal 'back' button, and that it is an especially bad design choice for a company like Apple which claims to value intuitive design.

------------------------

Whenever I bring this up in real-world conversation, my friends are quick to point out that Apple's sales show that most people have no problem with the design of the iPhone. I concede that this is true; however, I would like to hear from you guys your views on how:

- The lack of a back button is not a bad thing, or how

- It's a bad thing, but you've learnt to tolerate it because of (reason).

CMV: Neil DeGrasse Tyson had a point,2043,715,2019-08-06 05:43:43,"I'm seeing a whole bunch of memes and shitposts hanging shit on [Tyson's tweet](https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/1158074774297468928?s=20) he made in response to the two mass shootings. 

Disclaimer: I don't think shootings are a good thing, I'm strongly in favour of gun control, and I do dislike terrorism. 

What Tyson did was provoke conversation on a variety of issues that don't get the widespread coverage that a shooting has, but have even worse effects. 

He was absolutely right about people responding emotionally to issues as opposed to rationally, because it's exactly how people responded to *his tweet*; instead of considering what he had to say and its relevance, everyone just insulted him and called him ""insensitive"". 

Sure, the time he said what he did may indeed be insensitive, but I'd argue that no matter when he said it, he would have been labelled insensitive. My point is that according to the stats Tyson listed, there are more families mourning deaths of their loved ones due to medical complications than those whose family members were victims of mass shooting. 

and sure, you can call the last point i just made insensitive towards mass shooting victims, but to ignore the issues Tyson raised would be equally insensitive to people suffering from those problems. 

If anyone could change my view, I'd be very interested!

EDIT: I added the link to the actual tweet in the first sentence

EDIT 2: I’m not here for a gun control debate, and yet so many people have hopped on the bandwagon of debating second amendment rights with me. I’m not American, and that topic is not what this CMV is about, so I’m going to stop replying to comments about it.

EDIT 3: I'm going to put this here because it's simpler. My view has been changed, based on two significant factors:

1. The way Tyson phrased his tweet implied that medical errors, suicide and the other issues weren't being tackled comprehensively by governments and other corporate bodies. As u/silverscrub pointed out, gun violence is problematic because it's not just people not doing anything about it, it's that there's specific lobbying groups that exist to prevent anything being done about it. 

2. The percentage of deaths caused by each issue; as u/amishlatinjew stated, the percentage of shootings that lead to fatalities is much much higher than car accidents, medical errors, even attempted suicides. 

Call me overly utilitarian but I don't find the ""mens rea"" argument particularly convincing; a person's death is horrible and tragic regardless of why they died. 

For all those of you arguing that poor timing and insensitivity is what makes Tyson's point invalid, you're not very convincing. When he maked his point doesn't change the validity of what he has to say. This CMV isn't about Tyson being a compassionate empathetic fella, it's about whether what he had to say was relevant. 

On top of that, as I've said quite a few times, *I don't think that this specifically is a much worst time than any other time he could've posted this tweet*. Imagine if instead of a day after the shootings, he posted the tweet next week. Or in 2 months, or in a year. He'd get just as much backlash then as he's getting now, partly because the US has on average one mass shooting a day. The wound is ALWAYS fresh. That's why I find the insensitivity argument unconvincing.",1
"CMV: There's nothing inherently wrong with letting one-job towns ""die off"".",2047,248,2017-08-14 22:49:32,"In generations past, people commonly moved to mill towns, mining towns, etc., for the opportunity provided. They would pack up their family and go make a new life in the place where the money was. As we've seen, of course, eventually the mill or the mine closes up. And after that, you hear complaints like this one from a currently-popular /r/bestof thread: ""Small town America is forgotten by government. Left to rot in the Rust Belt until I'm forced to move away. Why should it be like that? Why should I have to uproot my whole life because every single opportunity has dried up here by no fault of my own?""

Well, because that's how you got there in the first place. 

Now, I'm a big believer in social programs and social justice. I think we *should* all work together to do the maximum good for the maximum number of people. But I don't necessarily believe that means saving every single named place on the map. Why should the government be forced to prop up dying towns? How is ""I don't want to leave where I grew up"" a valid argument?",1
CMV: It should be legal to sell one of your kidneys.,2045,350,2019-12-25 22:23:52,"I believe anyone should be allowed to sell their healthy kidney and any organ they don\`t need to survive for that matter. There are thousands of people on organ donor lists dying each year while waiting for a healthy kidney. Here in Germany it is in fact the most requested organ in hospitals. Currently we are relying on the altruism and the initiative of those who are willing to donate their organs after brain death or those rare individuals who donate a kidney while they´re still alive. This simply doesn´t work as there are almost ten times as many patients on waiting lists as there are organ donors. 

Creating a market for kidneys would incentivize giving your kidney to those in desperate need and take care of the shortage that is inherent to the donation system. Another benefit of a kidney market would be to make black market trades obsolete. The kidney removal would have to be strictly government regulated and only be performed under the highest standards of medical technology. 

Generally my proposal relies on the presumption that the risks that come with removing an organ are minimized and accounted for in the price of the kidney. I sincerely hope for an interesting discussion.

Edit: In response to multiple commenters I have to add a vital aspect of my proposed system.
In order to not put buyers at risk of buying kidneys that are harmful to their health, a medical evaluation of every potential seller would have to be perforned that outruled all people with nephrological conditions and drug addictions. 

I am sorry for not including this in my initial post.",1
CMV: It is entirely fair to “assume” someone’s gender/pronouns based on their apparent characteristics,2039,360,2019-03-04 00:01:22,"I encountered this [flyer](http://d.umn.edu/sexuality-gender-equity-initiatives/education-advocacy/pronouns) recently, which is the basis for this post. After looking into the topic some more, I have some serious issues with the idea that it’s wrong to assume people’s gender or pronouns. I will ignore most of the practical issues and focus on my fundamental disagreement with their outlook:

First, this is about gender, not pronouns. The pronoun issue is quite simple: if someone asks you to use a certain pronoun, use it. If you don’t, you’re an asshole. Simple as that. These issues are rare, and can easily be addressed like this or by saying your pronouns if you feel its necessary, like with a preferred name. Unfortunately, some activists have the idea that everyone has to  introduce their pronouns instead of making assumptions.

This core idea, that you can’t know someone’s gender by looking at them, seems completely nonsensical to me, if we break it down. This is that “did you just assume my gender” crap that I know actual activists think is crap. There’s a reason it’s become a meme. The obvious differences we can observe are for all practical matters an *intentional* gender presentation that people *want* others to recognize. It’s a *combination* of sex characteristics, clothing, appearance, language, and other stuff like voice that we’re good at recognizing. Society cares about this not only due to identity, but due to sexuality: sexual orientation makes absolutely no sense if we take seriously the idea of not “assuming people’s gender.” This isn’t something trivial: it’s a fundamental part of how we interact with each other.

Other points:
- Pronouns do clearly have a gender: people will use specific pronouns because they align with their gender identity. The claim that they do not is simply false. Names, clothes, and other things similarly have a gendered implication that gives information.

- I’ve heard people say “today you can’t assume someone’s anatomy from their name or appearance.” That is in fact exactly what gender does, however: how else are we supposed to know who has the genitals we desire? Also the woman has vagina, man has penis thing is a description of reality, something that is going to be true 99 percent of the time. The point of a generalization is not to cover every situation and exception, but to be useful in everyday life

- I believe this whole pronoun thing is really being pushed by a loud but super fringe feminist/social justice groups. No one but these groups, which have radical ideas about gender and sexuality, actually thinks this is a good idea. Why universities and others like in this article play what is in effect lip service to these ideas I don’t really understand: no one seriously ignores gender in how they perceive the world.

- It’s worth underscoring that there is A LOT of disagreement even among activists and LBGT+ people about pronouns: different people have different opinions; it’s not wrong or exclusionary to disagree with someone’s take. Three things I have heard though are 1) pronoun introductions turn into a “check the box” thing that everyone agrees is dumb, 2) some transgender/other people feel patronized by this stuff, and 3) it pressures people who might not be comfortable into discussing their gender.

I believe you should make a reasonable inference based on what a person is most likely going for. “Assumption” is a maligned word; “interpretation” or “inference” is more accurate. Usually this is obvious; if it’s not, *then* maybe you should ask. This is rare, and typically people are chill about it. And if you make a mistake, apologize and move on. 

The important thing is just to respect the person’s wishes on how to refer to them, because it’s their own identity. The whole obsession with making it a normal thing to introduce pronouns or put them in email signatures or never make any references to a person’s gender is both unnecessary and absurd if really considered. The bottom line is to be aware that you’re making assumptions, not to stop making all assumptions. For all these reasons and more I believe this issue is both deceiving and not the real issue it’s made out to be.

This will be controversial: have I characterized this correctly/am understanding it? To me it seems like this is pushed mostly by an extreme but vocal gaggle of activists, but this is admittedly from my perspective as a cisgender male, so I would be interested to hear what actual transgender/non-binary people think of the issue.

CMV and let’s try to discuss this in a civil manner",1
"CMV: The NRA is a caustic force in the United States, and any benefit they provide to gun owners is now an afterthought or side effect of shilling for gun manufacturers, and potentially funneling foreign money into US elections.",2029,611,2018-07-20 00:25:31,"The NRA started out as organization by and for gun owners. They provided a real service to owners and the citizenship at large, doing things in more recent history such as recommending and providing gun locks, [supporting the FFA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rifle_Association) and the creation of FFLs, supporting the [exclusion of criminals and those with mental problems](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rifle_Association) from owning guns in the Gun Control Act of 1968. They also have a wide array of safety programs and training courses that they provide. 

However, at some point in their history, probably at about the same time that [""other"" sources of income overtook membership dues as their primary source of revenue](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/02/26/nobody-knows-how-many-members-the-nra-has-but-its-tax-returns-offer-some-clues/), they became an organization whose sole purpose was to push more guns no matter whether there was a benefit or a detriment to society. Recently, [evidence is coming to light](https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article195231139.html) that they may have also become a funnel for hostile foreign powers to funnel money into US elections to again push for more guns and less restrictions (something which doesn't seem to support that this would be in the best interest of the US).",1

Many people choose to respond in some way, either saying they don't carry cash, don't give money, or just a flat no.

But I think it's entirely acceptable to flat out ignore the person and not acknowledge them in any way. I didn't ask for this interaction, and being in a public space does not entitle the panhandler to one with me.

Beyond being acceptable, I think it isn't even rude to ignore them.

CMV:If Women have the right to be Pro-Choice then Men deserve the right to decline fatherhood.,2031,1945,2015-05-28 04:46:45,"Hello CMV!

First of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on this later). This has potentially shaped my ideas on the matter but I thought I'd throw it out there. Please don't judge me on my politics but on the content of the CMV.
I believe that in a free society people have the right to decide whether they should keep a baby or not, women have the right to abort or raise a child. However I believe that men deserve the same right after sex with regards to the child (it takes two to tango). If a mother decides to keep the child then the father deserves the right to accept, or opt out of, fatherhood including all of the repercussions and payments that could be associated with such.

I understand that the state assumes the right of the child > the right of the parent, however I believe strongly that the father has the right to continue to live his life without sinking payments into a child which was optionally chosen. If a man decides he does not want to keep the child then he has the right to refrain from supporting it throughout its life.

Or on the opposite, if a mother is given the option to keep a child, willingly knowing the father does not want to, then she is accepting the responsibility of raising a child by herself, as she has no right to enforce payments on a consenting man who did not wish to have a child.
Obviously this excludes rape and all other implications, this is only within consensual sex.

TL;DR: Men deserve the right to decline fatherhood, and refuse payments for a child they did not wish to claim responsibility for, in a consensual Pro-Choice environment.

EDIT: Slight confusion/comments regarding abortion, I believe that it is solely the woman's responsibility as to whether she should abort or not, it is her ""pro choice"", however fathers have the right to ""opt out"" of fatherhood, or responsibility for that child should the mother keep it.
EDIT2: This is going pretty well, some good discussions. As suggested another way to put this would be 'Committing to sex is not committing to parenthood"". 
TheScamr worded this nicely:
>Right now a woman cannot be compelled to be a mother, either financially, custodially or emotionally due to abortion or adoption. Pro choice advocates say when a woman consents to sex she is not consenting to motherhood. OP is asking whether men should also be free such compulsion and the same condition : consent to sex is not consent to fatherhood, either financially, custodially or emotionally.

EDIT3: This has sparked a really nice and balanced discussion, so thank you CMV. It's a controversial topic because while Men should have the same rights as Women, the rights of the child seem to take over that of the father, but not the mother. I think /u/Billy90 put forward the best argument against this.

CMV: The most ethical course of action is to take very drastic measures to stop climate change,2018,361,2019-02-05 03:30:20,"I briefly cite my premises:

* Climate change is real (If I wanted to discuss this fact then my title would be different. I will not award deltas to people saying it is a conspiracy or a myth) and is mostly caused by humans as per IPCC and Stern Review (I will accept credible criticism of this claim). 

* As per IPCC's 1.5 Celsius report, published in late 2018, the damages of climate change are now unavoidable and we need to prepare for them. In the next 20 years we will see drastic weather conditions, loss of ecosystems and water stress *no matter what we do*

I have two arguments:

* Actual Generations vs. Future Generations

> The actions we take today to fight climate change, however small, will influence the well being of ALL the generations to come. To make this a proper argument I'll put it in mathematical terms: unless there is a massive extinction of all humans, the generations to come are *virtually infinite*. Therefore, a marginal benefit for them would mean an infinite net benefit. A marginal damage to them would be an infinite net damage. It is ethical to take the most drastic actions possible right now to ensure no net damage.

* Developed vs. Underdeveloeped: 

>Countries with high levels of development have the highest levels of emissions, which makes them the most responsible for the problem. At the same time, they also have the highest adaptability, which means that when the damages of climate change do come they will be able to mitigate the effects. In the mean time, underdeveloped countries have had the lowest emissions, making them the least responsible, and will be the ones to suffer the most. Island states ─ like Tuvalu, which has already begun evacuating due to the rising sea-level ─ and arid states such as those in Sub-Saharan Africa will be the most affected while also being the ones that contributed to the problem the least.

My conclusion, which I intend to change by starting this discussion:

* The most ethical course of action is to take extremely drastic measures to reduce the plastic pollution and green house gas emissions. No matter what the cost is, it is of the utmost necessity that all developed nations and all contemporary generations be pushed into a draconian regime of environment conservationism.

By stating my conclusion in this way I am willful opening my reasoning to a line of critique: maybe such drastic action would be more costly than a more moderate action. So far, the evidence I've found points to the contrary, but I'm willing to open up my perspective in this respect.

The only reservation I have in this discussion is that I will not admit unfounded arguments saying that climate change is a conspiracy or a myth. I will consider any and all evidence regarding other points, but will not respond to claims that there is no climate change.

Thank you very much in advance, and thanks for reading this.

"CMV: As a black teenager, Marvel's way of bringing ""diversity"" is insulting and patronizing",2021,293,2019-07-29 08:21:45,"First off, yes I am black. It's sad that I even have to say this. When I talk about this elsewhere, I'm called a racist, but as soon as I throw this fact out, the narrative totally changes. 

The way Marvel has gone around race swapping and gender bending characters for ""diversity"" is complete BS. There are SO MANY black and female characters in the comics. Marvel has been around since World War Two, and they have plenty to choose from. But instead, they decided to do this and say ""you need representation""

What is this? They can pick unique characters like Monica Rambeau and put them in, which fits their narrative, but then they'll needlessly change the appearance for ""diversity"". It's so insulting, as a young black man, to be told that I can only relate to characters that look like me. And it's even worse that they take HISTORICALLY white characters, and say ""here you go, accept this or you're racist"". 

Marvel doesn't care about people like me. They only see $$$ signs. They can't even bring in enough original characters despite decades of source material. They change white to black (which is basically a damn hand-me-down). 

It's like us black people are just trophies to show off for them. ""Hey, look here, we have a black guy! A woman!"" 

And their commitment to this is highly questionable. Monica Rambeau was turned into a child, looking up to Carol Danvers. I've read that Rambeau was going to continue looking up to Danvers, and take inspiration from her, which is BS. We're finally getting Blade and got Black Panther, and that's really it. Falcon taking the Captain America mantel takes away what made him FALCON. And how they treated black characters before is absolutely horrible. Darwin from the X Men is near OMEGA LEVEL, and he was killed off early. 
And don't get me started on the female characters. Black Widow was literally fridged (killing off female characters to give the men some sort of character arc). 

I cannot stand with this anymore",1
CMV: A trophy hunter or someone who hunts for sport saying they love animals is like a serial killer saying they love humans,2011,694,2019-11-15 12:25:57,"#I don't mean somebody who lives in the wilds of Alaska and kills for food. Before anyone jumps in with that. I specifically mean hunting for sport or entertainment. NOT TO EAT AND NOT FOR PEST CONTROL/ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS.

What I mean is, the logic (if you can call it that) behind someone who kills animals for sport (and gains some kind of pleasure/enjoyment/thrill from the act of making a kill) saying, ""You don't understand, I LOVE animals!"", followed by some explanation involving conservation, would be the same thing (minus the legalities and social constructs) as a serial killer proclaiming that they love their victims. Like this:

Hunter: ""You just don't understand, I love animals!"" 

Also hunter: ""I love hunting animals, and the thrill of making a kill. It's such a rush!"" 

Put anything else in the place of animals -- women, babies, cats, puppies... it just doesn't add up, right?

Edit: Sorry if I don't reply to everyone or if I replied more than once, I was using my phone and it was showing me replies I'd already answered on my computer.

Since about 99% of the comments seem to be missing the point, I'll try to further clarify it:

CMV: Nothing I can do will meaningfully contribute to ending climate change and pollution.,2015,319,2019-04-14 21:57:42,"Hello! I'm writing this because this is a rather pessimistic stance, and I really hope someone can change my mind.

I think that, for some reason, people seem to enjoy antagonizing themselves. *We* are the ones causing climate change. *We* are the ones killing the polar bears and walruses and penguins. *We* are the reason why plastic is in the ocean, and why  the rain forest is depleting.

But I don't think it's an individual issue. If I were to cut out meat entirely, stop purchasing anything made of palm oil, only ever bike to school, and never purchase anything made of plastic or with plastic packaging, climate change would still be happening. It might help slightly, but not in the long run. I am only one person. People say that everyone's actions will add up, but I don't think that many people will ever sacrifice their current lives to save our planet's future.

100 companies alone are responsible for *71 percent* of global carbon emissions. This shows that pollution is caused primarily by companies and corporations, not by 'little' people like you (probably) or me. Sure, if *everyone* stopped buying Toyota cars, they'd probably stop/reduce their emissions of carbon and drop off the list. But I think it's rather impossible to get everyone on board for that. They will keep contributing to climate change whether they have 10 million customers or 9 million, or even just 1 million.

Keep America Beautiful is a good example of where my opinion lies. KAB was created in the 50's by people like the Pepsi and Coca-Cola CEOs. They're the ones that coined the term 'litterbug' and fund beach clean-ups and similar events. I think this is rather despicable, really; rather than taking responsibility for the huge amount of plastic they manufacture with, they shift all blame to individuals like you or me. Why should a bunch of people like us have to clean up the ocean for KAB due to a problem almost entirely instigated by KAB?

A last thing I wanted to touch on--the self antagonizing stuff is especially bad for those of low incomes. Even if I wanted to cut out plastic and stuff entirely, I, along with what I'd argue to be most Americans, couldn't afford to. Eco-friendly products are typically much more expensive than standard ones. Cotton clothing is often much more expensive than clothing made of polyester.

I don't think that using an LED bulb rather than fluorescent, or skipping a shower every other day, or boycotting everything made of palm oil is really going to do anything. This mentality is harmful not only for antagonizing people with low incomes, but for shifting blame off companies and onto average people. Voting is a good start to solve these issues--holding politicians accountable for keeping companies, corporations, and net carbon emissions in check--but I cannot yet vote, hence the title ""nothing I can do."" Overall, though, I think the solution isn't for us to take responsibility, but for those with power to hold corporations and companies responsible. Please change my view! And if there *is* something I can do that meaningfully impacts climate change, please share that with me!

EDIT: Woah, thanks so much for all the insightful comments and great discussion! I've never had a CMV or post like this, and I really appreciate all of the conversation! Right now, thanks to you all, I've changed my view to something like: it's good to strive to act environmentally-friendly via recycling, conserving energy, etc, as it's the moral thing to do, and one's actions may influence others. Alone, nothing I can do will meaningfully contribute to ending climate change and pollution or create a long-term change. However, by acting as a unit with others and placing pressure on others, a larger impact may be made. Framing climate change as solely an individual issue is still harmful, not only for antagonizing people with low incomes, but for shifting blame off companies and onto average people. Voting and lobbying are perhaps the best ways to combat climate change at this point. That, and not having kids.

I didn't expect this many comments and I have homework to do so it might take me a while, but I'll try to reply to everyone. Thanks!",1
CMV: To become a police officer should require a four year degree,2011,484,2017-12-09 10:22:55,"I have a firm belief that many instances of police brutality could be avoided through proper education. To become a police officer should require a specially designed degree suited for the areas of knowledge required by a good cop. Local history, criminology, local/federal law, martial arts, local geography, and the most important one of all: psychology. I can not believe we send these men and women out there unprepared to deal with everything from arguing spouses to murders without training them to understand *why* these people act the way they do. 

An example of how psychology could help:

A cop that constantly fidgets is going to encourage the citizen to either run or fight. Here's why. In that moment where you have a cop with gun pointed at a 'zen, the cop is the threat. No matter if the the 'zen is completely innocent, you understand. His lizard brain is already in control, he could die, this is serious. Now, if the threat moves, your brain is going to tell you to react. If the threat stays still, your brain is likely to wait to see what the threat does so it can react accordingly. So what happens when a cop fidgets? The 'zen's brain is already caught in this loop of Run?!FightNooFightNO!RUN???NO!!! All that movement just encourages the brain to subconsciously choose for you and simply *act*, bypassing your active suppression. So many of these encounters could be solved and avoided with basic psychology.

Beyond actually preparing them for what they're up against, is that it SHOULD be hard to do. It shouldn't be this easy to be the arm of the law. I know it isn't like applying to Taco Bell, but it should be almost as rigorous as med school, in my opinion. Which is a sight harder than it is now. Just institute it, grandfather in cops with a certain amount of experience. Allow current cops without enough experience to keep jobs but attended one class per semester. Allow cops for next four years to get jobs, but only if they attend classes. First crop of degree cops come up, now require a degree always. 

Anyhow, poke holes in my 4-year degree specifically designed for cops idea (not just any degree, but one required for cops). CMV.  ",1
CMV: Cyclists should have more personal responsibility for their safety than pedestrians,2012,364,2019-09-09 23:35:32,"Post inspired by a cyclist almost committing suicide with my car, which is the circumstance I will use as an example here.

I live in an area with a moderate number of cyclists (usually see one-two per day, give or take, during my short commute to/from work). I'm all for sharing the road, and for drivers taking into consideration the fact that cyclists are hilariously ""unarmored"" in comparison to anyone in basically any motor vehicle. The main area I diverge from agreeing with local laws is at the intersection of cyclists and pedestrians. Where I live, cyclists in crosswalks have all the rights of pedestrians in them. I'm even generally okay with this, except that cyclists are both faster and have less control over their speed than pedestrians, and I think the onus should be on them to account for this.

Rundown of what happened on my way home from work the other day:

I have to make a left turn at a three-way intersection (I'm coming from the odd direction), which involves crossing a frequently used crosswalk. I pull into the intersection, stop, wait for pedestrians to clear out, then start making my turn. Cyclist is riding at speed on the sidewalk (in front of me), makes no indication he's going to do anything but keep riding, then at the last second leans in and enters the crosswalk, still at a decent cruising speed. Luckily I was paying attention and able to barely stop my car before hitting him (or being hit by him), but honestly it was close enough that I'm not going to pretend it couldn't have gone differently if any number of small factors were changed. Due to the fact that he was in a crosswalk with a walk sign, there is almost no chance I would not have been found at fault for hitting him in this scenario, not to mention the whole ""having to live with myself after flattening a person"" thing.

I think that requiring cyclists to stop, or at least slow down to sub-walking speed, before entering crosswalks to obtain ""pedestrian"" status, and otherwise be treated as vehicles crossing a roadway without right of way, would at least resolve the issue from the motorist side of things, but I can also see how this is not a simple clear-cut solution with no unwanted side effects.

In summary: Cyclists bearing no responsibility for entering crosswalks safely is ridiculous due to how much faster they move than actual pedestrians. It would probably be better if they were required to stop (and ideally apply all other common sense about crossing a road) before doing so. Regardless of the ideal solution, the way this currently works (in some places at least) is unnecessarily dangerous for both cyclists and motorists.

&#x200B;

Edit: A number of people have brought up the poor biking infrastructure in the US as deserving (some of) the blame in this situation. I think said infrastructure should be made way better, but this is a separate issue that doesn't apply here. To be more clear: I don't think there should exist, anywhere, places where cyclists are legally allowed to enter crosswalks at speeds exceeding that of a pedestrian (4 mph is apparently the rule in some places, getting off of one's bike and walking it is the rule in others) without being treated as motor vehicles in regards to fault, right of way, etc.",1
CMV: virginity is a pointless term and we should stop using it,2012,705,2019-03-02 23:20:48,"In the past there was no such thing as a male virginity at all, and the term ""virgin"" was applied to women only to suggest ""unspoiled goods"". Good start.

Today the term makes no sense. What constitutes virginity? PIV sex? Then gay people stay virgins for life. Any sexual experience? Bj, anal and even making out are sexual experiences. A woman who had her hymen torn is not a virgin? What about women who had their hymen torn due to excercise or any other cause, or women who had no hymen to begin with? Out of about 8 girlfriends I asked, only one had blood during her first intercourse. Dis that technically makes them virgins or not virgins before that had their first sex?

Okay there is a simple definition you can describe ""a virgin is someone who didn't have sex"" but again, blowjob is technically sex, but people don't call giving or receiving blowjobs ""loosing one's virginity"". As I said previously, a lesbian woman who had a lot of lesbian sex without using a dildo is technically a virgin? Then do we really need this term at all?

So that's my first point - that virginity is a blurred term and shouldn't be used in modern times, because implications of this term are pretty much harmful. It's used to shame and judge both men and women, although for opposite reasons. It's simply incorrect. You can be a woman with hymen and not be a virgin. You can be a man who never had his dick in somebody, and not be a virgin.

So yeah, change my view. To clarify, I have two points 1) the term virginity doesn't make sense anymore 2) this term is harmful to men and women and we should stop using it

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** I agree that banning words from dictionary makes little sense. But society evolves, and so does the language. I changed my view in terms that banning words is a bad idea, but I still think we need to change the usage of the word, and update it's meaning. Despite what some people wrote, there is no actual consensus it what the word means, so it's pretty individual. I would agree with the definition of ""a virgin is someone who didn't have any consensual sex"" not just penetrative or PIV sex. It's debatable, but  that's my opinion. I don't think a christian woman who had anal only is a virgin, nor is a gay guy who only received blowjobs. I think a rape victim is a virgin if they had no consensual sex before. Also, and it's a topic for a totally different discussion, and I'm not answering any messages in the matter, but in my opinion rape and sex should never go together. And stop giving me dictionary definitions I know perfectly what a word sex and rape mean, but words and language are used to navigate through life, and equating rape with sex is — *trigger warning, I'm going to say the word ""problematic""* — problematic. There is literally nothing in common between a violated person, and someone who just had their first sexual experience, and no amount of online dictionaries will change that. 

At least, we should stop using ""virgin"" as an insult, and call out those who do. I remember the time when ""gay"" was used as an insult. 

**EDIT2:** No I'm not a male or a virgin and if you call me one, then you just prove my point. Just think of what it tells about you and society if you consider ""a virgin"" an insult. And yes, I also contributed to the problem, calling men virgins as an insult, and I think it's not okay. It hurts both men and women. ",1
CMV: Church revenue should not be tax exempt.,2014,717,2019-12-29 09:27:36,"Churches (especially in the Southern US) are very large and have a very consistent income. I personally was raised LDS/mormon so I will be using numbers based off that specific church, though the numbers are still comparable with other religions. l was told my entire life that I was to give 10% of my pretax pay to the church. The church has 16.3 million members worldwide and 6.68 million members in the U.S. The average household income in the U.S. is $46,800 meaning that on average each family is giving $4,680 annually in tithing.

"CMV: In tournament based sports, teams should compete for ""true second""",2012,140,2020-03-03 02:17:54,"Let's say there are four teams in the semifinals of a tournament. Team A, Team B, Team C, and Team D. A plays C and B plays D. If D and C lose, they play for third while A and B play for first. Let's say B and D lose, typically meaning that A got first, B got second, C got third, and Dgot fourth. However, both team B and team C are 1-1, both having beaten team D and having lost to team A. There is no difference in the games they played and the results they had. The only reason B got second over C is that B played D first while C had to play A. In my eyes, these two teams should play an additional match for ""true second"". Especially in tournaments with lots of monetary implications based on placement, why is this not standard? Do people ignore the arbitrarity nature of giving second to the team that got to face the weakest team in the first game rather than the second game?

CMV: The short form for the date should be written as YYYY/MM/DD,2006,356,2019-11-30 05:25:04,"If you really want to avoid confusion write it out I.e. November 29th 2019, but for short form 2019/11/29 makes the most sense. You can easily sort the dates and compare them, it follows a logically format of longest to shortest and having the 4 digits in the year avoids any confusion as to which century/millennium it refers to.

Writing it as we say it doesn't make sense as people say the date differently. Such as saying the 29th of November 2019 (29/11/2019) or November 29th 2019 (11/29/2019)

This should be the standard around the world so if I see 2019/01/09 I know automatically it means January 9th 2019 and dont need to worry it could be September 1st 2019.

edit:

1. Hyphens do make more sense then slashes as you cannot save a computer file with slashes and does conform to the ISO 8601 standard.  I have changed my view that whether writing or digital we should use the hyphen so we  are consistent in all formats.
2. Many have  argued for ""Day Month Year"". I acknowledge that many places and countries use ""day month year"", and that is one argument for that format to be the standard, I do not however agree with the argument that is should be that way because we care more about which day it is over the year and so that's why it is first to read.  One can easily read it at the end of the string of numbers, and sorting becomes more problematic when it's not ""Year Month Day"".  One can also easily drop the year at the start if they only care about the month and day (11-29) instead of (2019-11-29), but even then I would still argue to include the year for consistency sake, or simply write it out in words (November 29th).
3. Some have said computers can automatically tell what the date is no matter which format, but that doesn't hold true when the year month and day are under 12 (01-02-03) or even (01-02-2003). The computer has to guess.",1
CMV: All successful entities in history have gotten to their positions at the expense of another group.,2000,201,2020-04-18 02:28:59,"Every successful country in the modern day (to my knowledge) either currently is or has in the past exploited a group or other country. An example I can think of is the countries that once were imperialist giants and are currently prosperous. Although they may denounce their repressive pasts, they are still backing off of their past glory. Even many countries that are successful now that weren't empirical in the past are still making their riches to the expense of their laborers (ex: Chinese sweatshops).

CMV: Telling any demographic to stop doing awful things is pointless,1998,605,2019-01-22 01:40:51,"All the Gillete ad controversy has got me thinking.

Most of my young life I had been afraid of flirting with, asking out and sometimes even interacting with women that I am interested in.

I was raised to respect women, and my understanding of how to respect women was just to not interact with them at all because it was too difficult for me to understand what to do and what not to do. (Edit for clarification: I am talking about my younger years. Here. I don't still have these problems.)

Conversely, guys that do not respect women aren't going to give a shit about what gillete or any ad has to say about being a decent human.

So my view to be changed is: that telling everyone to stop doing something wrong results in the wrongdoers to continue doing what is wrong and everyone else at risk of getting social anxiety because they want to be better but they were already doing fine, so they withdraw themselves from social situations to avoid fucking it up because of the supposed problem.

CMV: I think I could kill a fully grown Walrus in hand-to-hand combat,1997,335,2016-10-20 03:28:38,"The fight would occur in the Roman Coliseum, flat terrain and no water.

I would be fighting a normal walrus, it wouldn't know a fight was on until it was tasting my nikes.

Some of my friends think it's ridiculous, but I feel like a Walrus would not stand a chance against me. Walruses are just so slow.

My current strategy would be getting behind the Walrus and clambering on it's back. From here I could deliver head stomps and gouge out it's eyes. It would take a while but eventually the Walrus would surely die. I know the Walrus would try to stab me with tusks, but because of the low agility of the Walrus, the tusk attacks would be very easy to dodge. Also I know the Walrus has 'blubber' but I still think my head stomps would rattle it's brain a good amount. Blubber is not a carbon fibre body armour, it's just blubber folks.

I think people overestimate almost all animals fighting ability and I think humans are better fighters than what we get credit for. Humans are just so much smarter than every animal. This Walrus has no strategy, he has a big fat body and long teeth.

"CMV: magnate-level business-people (such as Bezos, Gates and Zuckerberg) are far more lucky than they are talented.",1986,275,2019-02-17 21:19:05,"Enormously wealthy business people are usually intelligent and talented in a narrow area of expertise.  They are not, however, meaningfully smarter or more capable than anyone else.

- timing 
- previous relationships
- previous experience 
- wealth
- social class
- luck of how all these come together
  
Are greater influencers on their level of success than innate individual capability.  We tend to attribute greater agency to them in their accomplishments than we should because we don’t account for the interplay of these factors. 

In particular, two attributes (wealth and relationships) have the greatest knock-on effects for them: those with financial means and powerful relationships can achieve higher orders of magnitude of impacts - paying continuing and gigantic financial dividends for a very long time. I think we give these individuals altogether too much credit and attention for something that, while incredibly hard, was every bit as attributable to luck as it was to their hard work.  

I’m not saying they:
- don’t work hard 
- didn’t make good choices 
- don’t have skills
- are undeserving of professional success
- are not unique

CMV: There should exist a system to ensure politicians admit to their blatant lies.,1993,265,2019-03-04 21:23:31,"TLDR at bottom.

This is CMV, so I understand that what I'm proposing may not be perfect. I also know that I am taking an idealistic view in implementing the ideas I have below. But I think that some democracies have the capacity to implement this, and the assumptions made here are a close representation of reality in some countries.

Fake news is a problem. Wouldn't it be nice if politicians were legally required to admit to their blatant lies? When I say 'blatant lies', I'm talking about the lies that are inexcusable. I'm talking about lies that are **statistically proven** to be false, lies that serve to **push a personal agenda**, and lies that have the **potential to disrupt** the country or government.

For instance, if a politician says that he has two children when he has one, he will not be charged as it does not disrupt the country.

Likewise, if he says that he will implement a proposal within a year but does not do so, he will also not be charged. Such acts will constitute a broken promise rather than a blatant lie.

Of course, the community that decides on what is a blatant lie may be biased. There should exist a guideline (the bolded points above might be a good way to start). But in reality, there is no 'unbiased' institution. However, I believe that it is certainly possible to construct such a (mostly) impartial community to facilitate its aims. This community's job is simple: to scour databases or news to prove or disprove the claims made by politicians, nothing else. In reality, most of their work could be replaced by bots. You can thus see why bias is only a minor obstacle.

Once the community has confirmed a blatant lie, a notice will be sent to the politician, asking him/her to retract his statement. There will be requirements on how this should be done. Ideally, I'm thinking of a short address published somewhere.  'On 25th June, I mentioned XXXX. I hereby retract that statement as it is false.' That would be all. The whole process should take less than five minutes. Lies must be retracted within a stipulated time period, and a politician can retract multiple lies at one go. The reason for this is to ensure that a politician is not overburdened should he/she be a obsessive liar.

If he fails to retract his lie, he will simply be removed from his current position, even if he is (somehow) the president. We live in a free country after all, so there will be no arrests.

**Why this system will be effective:**

Even though it covers only certain types of blatant lies, it **holds politicians accountable** for the things they say. There will be **trickle over effects** for our democracy as well. Every grand promise a politician makes is based on *something,* and if this something is false, we shouldn't be entertaining them at all. Getting politicians to admit to their lies basically invalidates perceived problems that do not need fixing. We can finally get on to the real things to **improve the maturity of our political discussion** and put **partisan politics aside.** Not only that, forcing politicians to admit to their lies basically embarrasses them and it allows the electorate to distinguish **between trustworthy and untrustworthy candidates.**

Exceptions:

In the unlikely event that a politician has to lie to keep the public safe, he can make an appeal to the courts. If this appeal is approved by the courts, he will not be required to retract his statement. However, once the crisis is over, he will have to confess to the public the truth.

As it is, our current system is not comprehensive enough. We must make it such that politicians who are obsessive liars are unable to avoid the consequences of their lies.

This kind of system is troublesome and embarrassing only to politicians who are obsessive liars. It is a small price to pay to maintain the sanity of our democracy.

TLDR: A community will decide if a politicians lies are blatant or serious enough to warrant retraction. If they find such a lie, politicians are legally required to take back their false claims or they will be removed from office. Simple as that.

"CMV: Being Edgy And ""Non-PC"" Is Not A Good Thing",1989,1240,2019-08-13 19:41:02,"I see an unfortunate trend amongst many people. People nowadays seem to think that having opinions which are edgy and go for shock value are a inately a good thing. This trend seems to be most apparent among the young.

I think the increasing trend of brash and ""non-pc"" opinions is partly due to a desperate yearning to be seen as cool or not seem like a ""square"". They think by saying and doing things which can be perceived as being ""offensive"" they become apart of a cool, rebelious minority who go against established norms on how to conduct oneself.  In my opinion , this couldnt be anymore wrong , because nowadays being edgy and controversial puts you in the majority group.

What's even worse is quite often this desire to be edgy and push the boundaries crosses over in to clear bigotry. When you make it a virtue to be offensive and not ""Politically Correct"" you are bound to say and do blantantly racist/bigoted things and anybody who calls you out for it is a boring , boot licker.

CMV: Men Should Pee Sitting Down (from a male janitor),1987,459,2020-01-16 13:14:14,"I am a 30 year old male. I'm currently working as a janitor and have a 30 year old female fiance.

CMV: Robin Hood from Disney in 1973 is the best version of Robin Hood,1984,173,2019-11-13 02:07:52,"I would like someone to convince me that Robin Hood from Disney in 1973 simply isn't the best version of Robin Hood, hands down. I have several points to prove this.

First point is the start (after the singing and credits), when we first meet Robin and John. They aren't fighting, villages aren't burning, they are just chilling in the river. They are jumped by the sherrif and what do they do? they run. This here is perhaps my strongest point, that the first scene with Robin is that he isn't fighting, but actually someone who is about living life. This sets him apart from just about every other Robin Hood which starts off with some kind of standing up to the sheriff. 

Not long after that John points out that they are criminals, asking if they are the bad guys (the original, ""we are the baddies?""). This is also great because it is setting up that they are not saying one is the good and the other is bad, it is pointing out that what they are doing is bad. It is a real admittance, right off the start, that they are outlaws and criminals. 

Next up, we see the king and his greedy for money, and what happen? Robin and John trick the prince. They don't use weapons, they don't use a trap with 15 people to surround them. They just use their wit, and once caught they again just run. Once again showing that Robin is not into violence unless he has to. 

Then we get to see Robin and how he interacts with the people, and how much they love him, once again he fools the sheriff. 

It isn't until the tournament that the fighting actually happens, and that is when they are trying to kill him. Even here Robin was trying to fool everyone, again avoiding violence. 

This version of Robin is that of someone who values life, will run rather than fight, and helps out the poor. He is kind and loved by all. 

Every other version of Robin that I know of, he is either violent, or resorts to violence, or standing up to the bad guy. This Robin is constantly in disguise, fooling people. He is among the people at all times but no one knows. 

Can you name me a better Robin Hood? I think not.

CMV: Captain Americas Assemble makes no sense as they have already assembled,1982,241,2019-08-28 18:50:01,"In Avengers Endgame, in a pivotal moment, Captain America calls on everyone to assemble. But, at that moment, everyone has already assembled. When he says assembled, they go to attack and arguably, disperse. Which is the opposite of assembling.

Everyone ignores Captain America's orders, in fact they do the opposite. 

Also, Captain America has never asked anyone to assemble before. The characters in the movie don't know it would be tongue in cheek, they have never read the comic books. They have no idea what the hell Captain America means, because they have already gotten together.

Also, Captain America whispers the line. Most people don't even hear it.  So why does he say it? We have never heard Captain America say these words before, and out of knowhere, he whispers it to himself during a major battle, while everyone else does the exact opposite of what he asked for.

If he wanted to, he could have yelled assemble while everyone was coming through the portals, then it would make sense. Change my view!",1
CMV:Investigations as high a profile such as Kavanaugh hearing should not be publicized until the verdict is out.,1978,275,2018-10-01 21:08:12,"The mere fact that this investigation is as public as it is, indicates that the verdict has already been made in the court of public opinion. If he is proven innocent (and I hope everyone believes innocence until proven guilty) then his reputation is tarnished forever. If he is proven guilty then Dr Ford will forever be to blame by the GOP. 

This further polarizes both sides which inevitably leads to people being dissuaded from holding public office from the fear of what they wrote in someone's yearbook 35 years ago.

I am neither right nor left, but I believe in fair treatment under the law and when an investigation is as public is this is, the people have already formed their opinion to meet their own agendas.

The solution is simple: hold high profile ongoing investigations in private and release the verdict when it's made allowing protestors, etc. to retroactively review/debate after the fact. CMV

EDIT: changed the word from trial to investigation because that is what people seem to be focusing on...

CMV: Pride is not the place to celebrate sex stuff.,1976,288,2020-07-26 07:46:32,"Lately pride has been less focused on actual pride for LGBT rights, and more on sex positivity. I’m not saying I’m against sex, but it’s not the right place for it. Pride should not be a place to celebrate kinks (S+M or furries or anything else), nor should it be the place to show up half naked and celebrate your “right” to wear as little clothing as possible.

There are other places to do that. There are clubs and online communities to celebrate sex positivity and kinks. But that has nothing to do with being gay.

Making pride about sex is super harmful. It makes people thing that’s a part of the LGBT community, which it isn’t. It’s super diverse and has nothing to do with sex in and of itself.

Also, the audience has to be considered. Some parents bring their children to pride to celebrate with them. They shouldn’t have to be scared that their kids will see nudity or inappropriate things for their age.

TLDR: pride is not a celebration of sex or kinks. It never should be because it has nothing to do with that. It’s only a celebration of LGBT a rights. Nothing more.",1
CMV: Students should not be required to share poems that they are forced to write.,1976,131,2018-06-07 09:15:52,"I am nearing the end of my junior year in high school, and our teacher is making us write poems and presenting them to the class. Usually I would be ok with this tbh, I would just write something kind of silly and creative, but our teacher wants us to delve deep and write about our emotions. Even though I am kind of BSing the poems, when I read them aloud I feel like people will think they are my actual emotions. Students that do write about their actual emotions still should not have to publicly speak their poem. I believe writing should be confidential between you and your teacher, and yes if their are signs of danger, they should be brought to parents and guidance counselors, but I don’t think that any student should be forced by grading to share their emotions with people. We already know kids are cruel, and this can lead to bullying and insecurity.",1
CMV: CEO salaries should be tied to the wage of their lowest paid worker,1977,1584,2018-08-09 20:03:16,"Something that is often attributed to the success of the modern company and economic growth generally is the tying of CEO salaries to the stocks of their respective companies. This provides a powerful incentive to a CEO to increase the 'value' of their company as it'll improve their stock. The downside of this is that it creates a massive wealth gap and enforces poor wage for low-skill workers, with CEOs making, in some cases, over 1000x minimum wage. Therefore, I think that as well as being tied to stock, CEO salary should also be tied to the wages of their lowest paid workers",1
CMV: Girls-only math and science competitions are counter-productive and do not help to encourage more girls into these fields,1976,308,2018-06-02 03:20:21,"Currently math and science tend to be much more male\-dominated than other fields, and this seems to be the case in math/science competitions as well. Competitions like the International Mathematical Olympiad \(IMO\) are usually disproportionately male dominated to the extent that one or two girls on a country's team is enough to make the news. To encourage more girls to enter competitions like this, and to encourage interest in STEM, there are some competitions like the EGMO \(European Girls' Mathematical Olympiad\) that are open only to girls. 

I find this counter\-productive because I don't see the reason why creating a competition only for girls will actually help encourage them into math and science. Separating by gender can give people the incorrect impression that girls are less able than boys in these fields and therefore require a separate competition to get anywhere at all.

The only reason I can think of for why a separate competition needs to be created for different genders is when significant physical differences would make a combined competition unfair \(which is why physical sports are separated by gender\) but in academic fields like math and science I don't see any biological reason why someone with XX chromosomes should be predisposed to be worse in STEM.

In addition, since the population is close to half and half male and female, a competition limited to one gender would probably mean less people take part \- so the fact that there are fewer people in the female only competition will mean that standards are lower overall, *just because there are fewer people in the competition.* 

\(It's like if you take the fastest person in a large city and a small village, the fastest person from the city is statistically more likely to be faster than the village person because there are more people in the city so the probability is higher\). 

This may mean that the girls only competition may be perceived as second\-rate or at a lower standard and wrongly stigmatise girls as being less able in math even though it isn't the case, which is counter\-productive to the original intention.",1
CMV: A biological woman should not be forced to give a Brazilian Bikini Wax to a Trans Woman (male genitalia).,1958,1070,2019-09-09 08:24:53,"The following is a quote from an article i pasted below:

“If you haven’t heard a month or so ago A Brazilian immigrant to Canada has been forced to shut down her body waxing business after she refused to wax the male genitals of a transgender activist. Jessica Yaniv, formerly known as Jonathan Yaniv, is a biological male who identifies as a woman. 

The Post Millennial reports that Yaniv filed a complaint with the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal last year after Marcia Da Silva refused to wax him. Yaniv argued that the mother of two discriminated against him on the basis of sex and he is now demanding financial restitution. 

Da Silva, who operated her business out of her own home, said she refused to serve Yaniv due to safety concerns and alleged harassment from him, not because he is transgender. 

Da Silva told the tribunal during last week's proceedings that the ordeal has forced her to shut down her business and it is not longer a source of income for her family. 

She isn't the only one who has been targeted by Yaniv. The transgender activist also filed complaints against 15 other British Columbian estheticians for refusing to wax his genitalia.”

Please read the articles below for more of the backstory. 

Ok...... 

Here is my argument.. 

A biological female should not have to put her hands near or on a biological male’s penis regardless. She shouldn’t have to do it because it’s her business and if she is only comfortable with touching women, with biological women’s parts, then that is where the line is drawn. She shouldn’t have litigation brought against her as it is a waste of her time and resources. She has any religious, ethical, situational, or moral right to say no, end of story. 

The following is an added edit after debating with people here..

The above wording focuses on one gender or sex vs another gender or sex..the above is true but it only applies to one angle.. I don’t want to delete anything I’ve written in this OP as it wouldn’t be right so..

Also I don’t view this as a trans rights issue I view it as a consent issue.. 

A better statement and argument is.. 

Concerning touching genitals, There must always be consent  no matter what the circumstances in any case anywhere.. 

If you try to force or coerce anyone to touch anyone’s genitals for any reason it is like a sexual assault. 

Edit #2) there can be one circumstance. If someone is having a medical issue a doctor or medical professional can touch their genitals without consent.

I’m from USA so I don’t believe that we have the same protected class laws so maybe someone from Canada or anyone will give me reason to change my mind.

CMV: Affirmative Action is bad policy (even from a progressive/SJW perspective).,1968,329,2020-08-22 22:47:27,"Generally, arguments against Affirmative Action are levied from a conservative (sometimes racist) perspective. Those against AA generally deny the existence of systemic racism or historical injustice against black people in the United States. Opponents of AA also tend to look down upon its recipients, believing that they don't deserve it.

I would consider myself a progressive. I acknowledge that historical injustice and systemic racism exist. However, I am still against AA as a policy for two main reasons: 1) it doesn't use progressive values to approach social justice, and 2) there is insufficient evidence that it is effective policy.

**Affirmative Action isn't progressive.**

* Two foundational progressive ideas are that race is a social construct and social justice should be viewed through an intersectional lens. Keeping these two ideas in mind, AA is not a very progressive policy.
* Race is a social construct. [That is the most scientific way to look at it](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/race-is-a-social-construct-scientists-argue/). Even from a less academic, more practical standpoint it makes more sense to view race as a social construct. Some black people look Hispanic, some Hispanics look black, other Hispanics look white. Indians can look Hispanic or black depending on the season. The fact that we lump East Asians and Indians into the category of ""Asian"", despite them looking nothing alike or having little to no cultural similarities should make you question the way we view race in America. At one point in American history, [Irish and Italian immigrants weren't considered white and were called white n-words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nigger#United_States), so even the category of ""white"" isn't fixed.
* If you accept this premise that race is a social construct, then race-based AA becomes very complicated; it becomes very difficult to gauge who ""deserves"" AA. Why do Hispanics who look white receive AA when Indians that look black do not? What about mixed race children? Indians, Irishmen, Italians, ethnic Jews, Chinese, and Japanese—while they weren't enslaved like black people—faced massive discrimination historically, and in some cases are still victims of discrimination today, yet these groups don't benefit from AA at all.
* Intersectionality is the idea that social categories such as race, class, and gender are interconnected and combine to create unique levels of discrimination and privilege. This further complicates the role of AA. Why should [white women benefit the most from AA](https://www.vox.com/2016/5/25/11682950/fisher-supreme-court-white-women-affirmative-action)? Should Nigerian immigrants, [who are arguably the most successful ethnic group in the US](https://www.ozy.com/around-the-world/the-most-successful-ethnic-group-in-the-u-s-may-surprise-you/86885/) and whose ancestors have not been victims of slavery in America, benefit from AA? It could also be argued that it is unfair not to consider class. Why should a white female student coming from an affluent family receive AA over a white male student coming from a destitute family? What about transgender students? Should a trans male receive AA because he is trans, or because he was/is biologically female, or should he be seen as having male privilege?

**Affirmative Action is not effective.**

* The stated goal of AA is to address racial inequality by providing opportunities to marginalized groups that have been squandered by historically racism and/or current systemic racism. I don't believe there is sufficient evidence to suggest that AA is effective policy for achieving that goal. One of the most comprehensive studies on AA concludes that [its efficiency is ambiguous at best and the redistributive effects may not be large](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jel.38.3.483). Given that AA has been around for over 50 years and its effects are ambiguous at best, I feel like it is safe to say it is not effective.
* An analysis of 45 studies on AA suggests that [it can perpetuate negative stigmas](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/behavioral-competencies/global-and-cultural-effectiveness/pages/affirmative-action-.aspx). So, not only is AA not very effective, it can also be harmful.

**Conclusion**

* I see AA as trying to use a band-aid to patch a severe laceration. It may or may not help, but there are more effective ways to deal with the issue of social injustice. Also, implementing AA without committing social injustice in the process seems very complicated when considering intersectionality and the socially constructed nature of race.

**Better Solutions IMO**

* End the war on drugs. [Blacks use and sell drugs at similar rates as whites, but are 6.5 times as likely to be incarcerated for drug-related crimes](https://www.hamiltonproject.org/charts/rates_of_drug_use_and_sales_by_race_rates_of_drug_related_criminal_justice). Ending the drug war could end the mass incarceration of black and brown men in America. Being raised in a [single-parent household is associated with more juvenile crime, worse educational outcomes, behavioral and emotional issues, etc](https://online.aurora.edu/single-parent-households/). Less incarceration could mean more intact families and better outcomes for black and brown children.
* Improve access to abortion and contraceptives. This can also help combat teenage pregnancies and reduce single-parent households.
* Don't fund schools from property taxes. Poorer (often black) neighborhoods levy less property taxes, which [leads to underfunded schools](https://www.npr.org/2016/04/18/474256366/why-americas-schools-have-a-money-problem). Education should be the great equalizer, but this system amplifies inequality between the rich and the poor.
* I believe these solutions, unlike AA, are closer to targeting the root causes of the racial inequality in America today. That being said, I am not a policy expert. These are just some of the many potential solutions.",1
CMV: Facial recognition systems should not be allowed to be used in public environments,1954,254,2019-03-10 20:40:41,"Facial recognition technology in public environments should **not be allowed** to be used for improvement of security. Even the fact that these systems are most probably already being used, they oppose a couple of ethical problems, to which we cannot remain naive about.

They are prone to making errors. Incorrectly classifying an innocent person as a criminal can become subjected to harassment by police. It puts these kind of people into difficult and possibly even damaging situations.

But more importantly, it is a massive violation of our privacy. This is the biggest problem with these kind of systems, because it cannot be solved by regulation or by redesigning the technology behind it. Therefore, these kind of systems should not be used.",1

CMV: Male victims of rape should not be required to pay child support to their female perpetrators if she gets pregnant.,1946,648,2018-05-09 22:57:30,"I thought this would be an uncontroversial issue, but after seeing the flood of downvotes on [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/8deefa/what_immediately_put_you_off_someone_you_once/dxnlh8m/?context=5) in an Askreddit discussion (in context), I guess it's not.

Men who are raped by women, in my opinion, should definitely not be legally required to pay child support to the woman if she gets pregnant. I believe that in any case of rape, the perpetrator should be responsible for all the consequences of his or her actions. When a person is raped, he or she has been violated in just about the worst way possible. To force a man to pay child support to the person who abused him would simply be straight up theft in addition to having been raped. Although the presence of a child does create a need for resources, I think the last person this responsibility should fall on is the person who has already been violated so horribly. To me, taking a person's money after he or she has been a victim of crime is the most unjust possible thing that can be done in that situation.

CMV: There's no consistent argument against incest,1940,890,2019-08-31 22:51:48,"Incest is probably the most widely spread taboo in human culture, but I find all the argument against it to be inconsistent.


1- **""Incest produces offspring with disabilities""**: this one is only partially true. Incest itself doesn't increase the chances of genetic disorders, and everyone that remembers Gregor Mendel's studies should know that. But beside this, incest is a sexual activity between closely related individuals, so it doesn't really require procreation, as it comprehends non reproductive activities such as oral sex and anal sex, as well as safe sex to avoid unwanted pregnancies. Banning the sexual intercourse to prevent the pregnancy seems excessive to me. Also, if the two individuals are homosexual, the problem of a pregnancy is non existent. Another counter argument could be: if we prohibit incest to prevent the birth of a child with genetic disorders, does that mean that we should also forbid people who have genetic disorders or carry a recessive gene that may cause a disorder to reproduce?


2- **""Incest is abuse/rape/pedophilia""**: I get this, because the majority of reported cases of incest usually involve an older relative that violates a younger one (e.g. a father and his daughter or a brother and a younger sister), but I think that this argument misses the point. The thing that makes these sexual acts immoral and punishable is not the fact that they involve two close relatives, but the fact that they are non-consensual and/or feature an adult having sex with a minor. A consensual intercourse between two adults is not harmful.


3- **Incest is disgusting**: this is probably the argument that I understand the most, but also the most fallacious one. Nothing can be considered inherently wrong just because it's considered disgusting by one's subjective views. It's not wrong to eat garlic bread with strawberry jam , even though many people (including me) would consider it disgusting.

***EDIT***: I **do not** support inbreeding, even though the ambiguity of my post made it unclear. People can engage in sexual activity without the purpose of procreation and, if done correctly, the risk of an unwanted pregnancy is really low. So I ask you to stop using the **""it causes genetic defects in children""** argument because **""a guy having sex with his own sister""** is different from **""a guy having a child with his own sister""**. I have no problem with the former, I have many with the latter.",1

CMV: You can't deradicalize people you don't talk to.,1937,243,2019-08-11 15:39:37,"I have a hypothesis. 

Online moderation contributes to radicalization through the formation of echo chambers. 

This is bigger than Reddit though, I'd like you to keep that in mind. 

I need to define content moderation:

My view is that content moderation is removal by a human or automated system of something posted online.

A typical example of this is a Reddit comment, another example is a YouTube video. 

So what's the problem right? Doesn't seem like there is a problem at a quick glance. 

People who get banned in most cases are people who break the rules of a community ya? 

Okay so they broke rules, let's work with that as the baseline of truth. 

Were the rules written in such a way that ensured some groups would break the rules at a disproportionate rate?

For example you can write a law that says nobody can drive on the highway after midnight, so everyone who commutes by that highway after midnight is breaking that rule.

If one of your rules is that nobody can post pictures of cats, if you ban everyone who posts a picture of a cat, you have created two echo chambers.

One is full of people who do not post pictures of cats, the second is people who do post pictures of cats.


These two groups, I believe, either become stagnant in their beliefs, or overtime strengthen those beliefs, becoming in this scenario a person who posts cats 24/7. 

An opportunity cost is paid - neither group can add anyone to their team from the other team, because neither team is in the same room. 

A second opportunity cost is paid - people from group A do not know how to effectively debate people from group B, and the opposite is true as well. 

I believe that people are not static in their ideals, I believe that every conversation moves us in one direction or another by imperceptible distance.. someone may change you a lot, that is rare though, someone can change you 1% of the time almost 100% of the time, either in their direction or further in yours. 

As such, if the only people you talk to are people who are either at your point on the number line or further down in the direction that you're already headed, you can truly only go one way, with a few exceptions, like if you reach the end of the number line and find out that your ideas were based on incorrect information. At that point you're the only one that can change you. 

To continue the cat metaphor from above: 

Some people may say that people who post cats are bad people and therefore it's entirely justified to ban them. 

An opportunity cost is paid - when you ban somebody who posts cats, posting cats may be 1% of their entire behavior. You have now just banned 99% of their behavior on the back of 1% of it. 

You have thrown the baby out with the bathwater, and in doing so created two echo chambers where neither side can talk.

I do not mean to imply that content moderation is 100% of radicalization, it may be as low as 1%, but I do believe it hurts more than helps. 


The phrase comes from a TV show sure but... We only make peace with our enemies, right?

TL;DR:

Mods = literally the worst thing ever.

 lol jk..I can't make this tl:dr sorry.


Edit: I'd like to add something else I should have from the start.

Presuppositionally, I believe that we have an obligation to be good neighbors.

 I believe that if we just ship the problem elsewhere, we are doing more harm than good, because often we are spreading the pathogen to several other entities aside our own.

 As well, since we may participate in those other entities at a lower rate than we do the original entity, we have also just shot ourselves in the foot a bit lol because we cleaned out this pool and dumped it all into our hot tub.

I've been told in the past the way to conduct a scientific experiment is to try everything in the world to disprove your hypothesis.

The trend is not moving towards talking to each other, the trend is moving further and further into echo chambers.

The consolidation of power in the executive branch has been growing for decades but this trial appears to be one of the most clear precedent setting moments that demonstrates the executive branch will not be put in check by the elected members of congress.

I don’t blame companies for this- their goal is to make as much money as they can while spending as little as they can. If they get caught, the punishment is usually a fine, as opposed to some form of incarceration. This fine can be much less than the amount the company made breaking the law. Often, the explanation I see for why a company will do this not just once, but again and again is because they make more than the fee costs. Why shouldn’t we charge them the amount they made?

CMV: I see nothing wrong with the Gillette ad.,1925,907,2019-01-21 01:54:54,"I'll probably get downvoted like crazy because of this but here goes.

I come from a country where masculinity is rank. The manlier, dependable, and trustworthy you are, the more respected you are in society.

However, some ""alpha"" males grow up being a little too rough and, sadly, become bullies and dickheads. I hate these people. Objectifying women, picking on and beating up weaker males, and thinking they can do anything and get away with it infuriates me so much.

When I saw this video, I thought, ""yeah this is a nice ad. Has some good points"" some things in it, i thought were unnecessary just because it felt like a filler rather than something that was actually meaningful.

The male population can be dicks and so can the female. And i feel like this video addresses what is wrong with a part of the male population, not the whole. Maybe it didn't give recognition to the ""other guys"" but I felt that that was something they didn't even need to mention anyways.

"CMV: There isn’t a good reason to use pronouns outside of traditional masculine, feminine and gender neutral options",1935,622,2019-11-19 02:03:35,"With respect to the gender identity movement, and those who struggle with their gender, I regularly use and accept when someone wants to be referred to by specific pronouns. I accept that there are those who don’t identify or align with their birth sex, and their mental identification more closely aligns with the opposite sex instead. If someone was born a man, but identifies as a woman, I have no qualms referring to them as she, her, etc. Likewise for those who are born female, but identify as men, I’ll refer to them as he, him, etc. What I’m struggling with, is how it has evolved to a point where pronouns have escaped the traditional masculine, feminine or gender neutral options, and what purpose the growing list options support. 


[Here are examples](https://uwm.edu/lgbtrc/support/gender-pronouns/) that I’ve come across from the LGBTQ+ resource center from [https://uwm.edu/](https://uwm.edu/). I’m sure there are plenty of other resources for the growing list of gender pronouns, but this seems like a good starting point for my view. Language is diverse, and I know that it changes over time. We have many words that mean the same thing, or clarify subtle changes between definitions. He/her/his/hers differentiates between masculine and feminine. They/them/we is used in neutral ways, and the traditional extensions of those pronouns seemingly covers 99% of people. 


What is the **function** of stretching pronouns even further with options such as Ve/vis/ver/verself or ze/zir/zirs/zirself? If you want options that aren’t restricted by masculine or feminine classification, we already have gender neutral pronouns such as They/them/theirs/themself, which accomplishes the same thing to my understanding. Why do we need additional, more specific options when in typical conversation, masculine, feminine or neutral pronouns cover the overwhelming majority of people? What **purpose** do these ever changing pronouns offer past confusion, and divide? And what problem do these new options solve?  


What would change my view: an example where existing masculine, feminine or gender neutral pronouns **don’t** accurately describe a group of people, but some of these new pronoun options do. If you have an example, what does the newer pronoun option describes that isn’t already covered by traditional options I’ve listed? 


You’re not restricted to the newer pronouns I’ve linked in this post. I know I’ve only listed a few, but am open to hearing about other pronouns that might be more widely known, that I’ve missed, but you’ll need to show why/how that pronoun describes a person better than masculine, feminine or existing gender neutral options.",1
r/ChangeMyView is graduating Reddit: introducing ChangeAView.com,1925,417,2019-04-06 21:03:39,"TL;DR: Reddit has been a great incubator for the r/ChangeMyView project, but we’re very excited to announce that we have built and launched [ChangeAView.com](https://www.changeaview.com) (now in beta) in order to take things to the next level. 

To those of you who have received *or* given at least 1 delta during your time on CMV: follow [these instructions](https://www.changeaview.com/cmv) to add a “legacy badge” to your CAV profile. We hope to see you at Change A View!


# What’s this about? 

r/ChangeMyView (CMV) has come a long way since its creation in January 2013. I never could’ve predicted its growth to 700,000 subscribers, the team of passionate moderators keeping things in check, nor the many genuine connections made here every day between people willing to listen and learn from each other. As the subreddit has grown, we've matured, and so have our ambitions. 

Reddit was the perfect starting point for this experiment, but we feel strongly that our positive contribution to public discourse would be better served by having the freedom to forge our own path. This is why, in mid-2018, I decided a “CMV 2.0” was necessary, and shortly formed a founding team with Alex (projectWATT creator), Liz (longtime CMV moderator), and Jon (u/DeltaBot developer) to begin development of ChangeAView.com (CAV). 

You may be wondering what exactly inspired us to expand outside of a subreddit—I’ll go into detail below. For those who want to better understand the original motivation behind CMV, and now CAV, please read [our mission](https://www.changeaview.com/our-mission).


# User Experience 

As moderators, we don’t have much influence on how Reddit works. Most of the time, that makes sense—imagine ~138,000 active subreddits, existing for wildly different reasons, all getting their wishes when it comes to the fundamental Reddit mechanics. While we had concerns that the Reddit redesign was favoring quick-consumption content over long-form discussion, and led a group that raised these in a proposal named “[Design for Discussion](https://changemyview.net/2018/04/20/design-for-discussion-solutions-that-value-reddits-conversational-corners/)” (which the admins engaged with us on), we ultimately realized that Reddit had made the necessary design choices for its needs. Our needs, we understand, are different.

While we continue to enjoy Reddit and appreciate that it afforded us an opportunity to learn and grow, this period of time was undoubtedly a catalyst for pursuing our own ideas and design philosophy. We’ve known for a while now that we’d have done many things differently if CMV had been built from the ground up instead of within the Reddit mould. For example, the purpose of voting would be redefined and ranking mechanics would reflect this, the delta system would be fully integrated, users could filter content geographically or by category, we would make dramatic moderation improvements that cascade down to the user experience, and many other CMV-specific features would be added. 

CAV has made this all possible, and much of it has already been built. But rather than continue to develop privately towards perfection, we’re now ready to share this journey with you as we continue to improve the website, including a feedback area dedicated to incorporating your thoughts and critiques. 


# Moderation Experience

Moderation deserves its own section. Reddit’s mod tools are perfectly fine for probably 99% of subreddits, but we have very specific workflows and record-keeping processes behind the scenes of CMV that use various “hacky” solutions. Tasks that take 7+ clicks, copy/pasting, and two browser extensions for us on Reddit are now completely streamlined at CAV. Removing friction and saving moderators time ensures quality at scale. This matters, as any CMV contributor will know, because what we do here only works if our rules and standards are consistently upheld.

We’ve built a public moderation log with the intention of allowing those who seek it out to verify that content removals are justified. We trust our moderators but understand that transparency in this area is mutually beneficial. Sometimes mods may still need to redact sensitive information from the public modlog—in cases of ‘doxxing’, for example.

We also plan to make the moderation team, led by Brett (CMV mod Ansuz07), a much more structured and valued part of the overall organisation. Our moderators are involved because we want them to be. We think humans need to be in the loop, and even though we are building partnerships to automate some moderation use cases, we want people looking at difficult scenarios and setting coherent precedents. For us, this is a feature, not a bug, and why we've spent so much time developing quality moderation tools.

## Perspective API

We collaborated with [Jigsaw](http://jigsaw.google.com/) and have integrated [Perspective API](https://www.perspectiveapi.com/#/) into CAV’s moderation. In addition to user reports, Perspective is used to increase the speed of our human moderation by flagging comments that may break our rules so that moderators can review and make the final call. We will continuously work to improve the efficiency and quality of CAV’s moderation to keep the conversation productive and inclusive.


# Future Plans

Launching CAV isn’t just about improving what we do today, but also having the capacity and autonomy to take opportunities and branch in new directions as we evolve. We have big plans, some of which we’ve made a start on, that will require more resources than we have now to fully execute—concepts like integrating with education, providing private CAV areas to organizations, and a widget to facilitate two-way CAV discussions below external articles. We also expect to eventually introduce a paid subscription on the public site for users who want some extra services/features. The website isn’t monetized today, but hopefully these ideas will generate the revenue necessary to make this project sustainable—we’re determined to avoid the need to display ads. 


# Let’s go change some views!

I hope this announcement has been informative—as you can probably tell, there’s a lot to cover here, so feel free to ask questions below or at [ChangeAView.com](https://www.changeaview.com), and remember to get your [CMV legacy badge](https://www.changeaview.com/cmv) if you qualify for one! 

Happy view-changing (and thanks for reading),

CMV: The idea of billionaires is unethical,1925,708,2019-08-25 04:04:37,"Look, I totally understand that in some cases, money is made through hard work and grit, among opportunity and luck. I applaud and congratulate those who have become millionaires through their own means. 

But billionaires....jesus. At some point, your hard work stops being the cause of your income. At some point, your money comes from the exploitation of others and our planet. I don’t think people fully comprehend the amount of money a billion dollars is. If I earned $1500/hour, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, and I had been working from the moment the Declaration of Independence had been signed, I STILL wouldn’t have a billion dollars. And there are people out there with billions PLURAL??

I just don’t understand how it’s ethical for people to sit on this pile of money that they’ll never reasonably use up and not do good with it. I mean, with that amount of money, you could solve disparities like homelessness, lack of education, and more! And people will say, “oh, they’ve donated $3 million here”, but for someone worth 100 billion, that’s literally .003% of their money.

It just blows my mind how people with this opportunities don’t spend it for the greater good and instead, just keep it to themselves. The Amazon rainforest is burning, and the man who named his company after it hasn’t done a thing. It’s absolutely insane.

EDIT: fixed a typo

EDIT 2: This got....a lot more responses than I was expecting. I’ll try and respond when I have time, but thank you guys for a contentious and eye-opening debate!!

EDIT 3: Wow. There’s a LOT of comments here. This is going to be my last edit because this grew a lot more than I expected. To address a couple points:

• I awarded one delta not because they changed my view, not because I agreed with them, but because they offered a new perspective into the conversation that I had not considered before. Again, it did not change my view, but it did make me stop and reevaluate. 

• Those of you saying that I’m just bitter because I don’t have that money and if I want that money I should work hard—I’m a teen from a fairly middle class background. I’m fine. I’m looking from an outside POV and offering a critique on the people as well as the system. Plus, saying that I should work hard for that money misses the whole point. 

• Yes, billionaires aren’t obligated to do anything, but this isn’t discussing legal obligations. This is looking from a moral standpoint, in which I’m saying they don’t HAVE to, but they SHOULD. 

• Yes, I know that billionaires don’t have billions of dollars of cash. Yes, I know to obtain that, they’d have to liquify their assets. I’m well aware. This is again as much of a critique on the system as it is of the individual person that allowed them to get there. With that type of net worth, people have incredible influence in the world too, both from a monetary aspect and a power aspect. 

• I know the world is a lot more complicated that I made it out to be in a Reddit post. I’m really just trying to get the barebones of my ideas down in words. Thank you for pointing out the nuances and creating meaningful discussions. 

Thanks for the opportunity to discuss this you guys. I didn’t expect this to get big, and while I don’t think I’ll be able to respond much anymore (I’ll see if I can), I’m really glad I got the opportunity to debate and learn.",1
"CMV: The US Military's internal justice system is actually more fair and overall better than the civilian one, and we'd all be better off if some version of it was applied country-wide.",1926,120,2020-01-04 03:35:01,"Just to give some background, I spent 8 years active duty Army, and worked as a prisoner-escort for a while. I'm not a legal scholar by any stretch, I'm just a guy who sat through a few courts martial, including one for a very serious crime.

It also means my experience is specific to the Army. The other branches might do things differently, but I'm pretty sure they are all basically the same.

Finally, I just want to preemptively point out, I'm not of the view that military *law* should be applied en masse. Military law and regulation is authoritarian by nature and it would be unacceptable to apply it to people that don't willingly choose to join. I'm talking specifically about the nuts and bolts of the court system, what happens when accused of a crime.

So, first off,

**The Article 15**
In the Army, its Art. 15, I think the Marines call it Non-Judicial Punishment, the other branches probably have some other name for it.

Basically, its kinda like pleading no-contest on a speeding ticket. Theyre usually applied when there is no real question on guilt. It generally just says ""You did this, here is a punishment."" 

If you are recieving one, you have the right to take it to a lawyer (and I'll get more to that further down). You can choose to accept the charge and the punishment. If you do, you dont have to go to trial, everyone saves a little time, and the punishments handed down by them are usually more lenient than an actual court can give. 

You don't have to accept one. You can always say that you're not guilty or you think the punishment dropping from one is too harsh, and take it to court martial.

But if you're caught dead-to-rights and the punishment from one isn't over the top, accepting one does make life a little easier for everyone. Your lawyer can generally advise on if it is a good idea to take it or not.


**The Lawyer Really is Free**

If going to court martial, just like in the civilian world, you have the right to an attorney. Just like in the civilian world, you can use a public defender (in the Army called Trial Defense Service). Unlike in the civilian world, or at least in many states, it is not up to the court to decide if you can afford your own lawyer.

In many states, the court will basically audit your personal wealth and decide if you can afford your own attorney, and tell you that you have too much to use a public defender. 

The Army's version is TDS. They are free. Period. If accused of a crime, they will help you. There is no hourly rate. You just make an appointment. They'll go over your article 15 with you and advise you on it. They will come defend you in court. They are just as capable and dedicated as any other Lawyer. And no one will ever ask you to ""prove"" you cant afford a real lawyer.

Of course, you can hire a regular attorney if you want. But you dont have to if the court decides your net worth is above some line they made. You wont have to skip meals to pay for a regular lawyer because the judge decided youre too wealthy for the public defenders office. You wont have to reveal the value of your car, house, or jewelry.


**There is no such thing as bail**

If you're accused of something serious enough to wind up in a jail-setting, you will have a pre-trial confinement hearing. You, your attorney, and the prosecution sit down with a judge.

The judge has to decide two things;

Could you be dangerous to others?

Are you likely to flee?

If both of those are ""no"", you get cut loose pending the trial. You dont have to come up with a few thousand dollars to let the court hang onto and possibly keep. 

**You can save the right to a Jury**

Granted, I think this does exist in some states, but Im not completely sure.

Basically, the default is to have a Jury, but you dont have to. If you choose not to, the judge ultimately decides guilt/innocence, and the punishment.

But why would you give up the right to a Jury? It actually does make sense in some cases. People on juries arent legal experts. Theyre people. They will likely assign sentence based on emotion, versus a judge who assigns what he feels satisfies the law.



Overall, the common theme above is mostly about money. I feel the military's internal courts are much more fair and unswayed by the wealth of the accused. I feel like it is a much better justice system in alot of ways than the regular civilian courts where the poor are often at a hefty disadvantage.

CMV: News outlets should refrain from showing the names and faces of mass shooters,1916,222,2018-05-20 11:59:50,"There is a sizable body of evidence which points to the spreading of this information as a possible catalyst for copycat events. Whether it is explained by the coverage ""planting the seed"" in a copycat, or someone wishing to gain the fame associated with perpetrating a mass shooting, it seems to me that this information has much less value to the public than would be necessary to justify it's proliferation. In cases where the information could help lead to capture or conviction, I would understand exceptions. However, like in recent cases where the killer is undoubtedly at fault and is in custody, I don't see a strong case for the spreading of this information. While I understand an outright ban would cut against the first amendment, news outlets should be pressured to voluntarily follow this guideline.",1
"CMV: Donald Trump's belief that global climate change is a hoax should be enough of a reason to vote against him, regardless of what you think of his opponents.",1915,426,2016-11-02 21:39:53,"Regardless of foreign policy experience, domestic policy agendas, or any outstanding scandals or political gaffes, this single issue should be at the top of everyone's list when comparing the presidential candidates. The fact that Trump has repeatedly denied the reality of climate change, even going so far as to claim it was fabricated by China, should be enough to disqualify him from earning your vote. 

To put it another (more expansive) way, it is our responsibility as voters to automatically reject any candidate for public office who holds such a belief.

CMV: It only hurts employees to NOT discuss their wages among each other and gives the employer more leverage when it comes to salary negotiations.,1913,288,2020-05-22 03:59:39,"I can't think of any disadvantages to all the employees at a company sharing their salary info. I think it's strange that people don't want others to know their income, like it will hurt them or embarrass them if they make less than their counterparts. On the contrary it would give you more power and information if you, for example found out someone who had equal training and experience was making more than you, and you wanted to ask your boss for a raise. **Edit:** Assuming the quality of work you were providing is similar. 

Also, it's a misinformation (or at least a lack of information) technique to keep employees docile and obedient when it comes to the discussion of getting a raise. 

All to often employees forget they are worth to the company just as much as the company paycheck is worth to them. I think sometimes it may be a good reminder to the workers that they also have just as much power, all they have to do is make salary information freely available among themselves.",1
CMV: We should have the option of having a painless death.,1913,267,2019-01-16 20:18:18,"I would gladly give up the last few months of my life in order to be able to die painlessly in my sleep instead of an unpredictable, incredibly painful death. That to me is worth the last few months of my life.

Currently, dogs and cats have more rights when it comes to Euthanasia than human being do. (I don't know if this is true, but felt right to write) Imo it wouldn't cost extra money either since the last few months of life are some of the most expensive health care wise and least productive work-wise. 

If it's optional, then no one who wants to live the last few months of their life has to, and people that do still can. 

I personally don't have a fear of death (I sort of welcome it), but I do have a fear of the pain of dying (I expect it to be the worst pain I'll ever feel). It would be nice if I wouldn't have to stress about it for the most part, since we have the ability to make death pretty much a pain-free experience, and for some reason, we aren't choosing to do so.

Feel free to change my view, or if you agree but have some insight, help me understand why the general population is against the idea of having a painless death. ",1
CMV: Minimum Wage Should Provide Enough for an Individual to be Self Sufficient if Working Full Time,1907,559,2018-03-31 00:27:43,"Minimum wage should provide enough for an individual working full time (which I will consider to be 35 hours/week) to meet their individual needs and have some extra for upgrading/saving/recreation (social mobility). 


They should be able to afford the following on minimum wage, after taxes:

-rent for a studio apartment

-utilities for yourself

-food for yourself

-internet/cellphone for yourself

-transportation for yourself

-healthcare (including essential drugs) for yourself

For example, I will use the following figures, based roughly from Toronto/GTA to illustrate my point. This is after taxes.
-rent for studio: $900, there are many studio apartments available for $800 to $1000 per month
-utilities: $100, this is an estimation for a studio
-food: $160
-internet/cellphone: $80
-transportation: $250 (weekly bus pass for unlimited bus use with TTC is $43.75/week for adults)
-extra: $300 (for savings, academic upgrading, social mobility, etc)
-healthcare: 0 (I'm assuming its already covered through taxation)


In total this is $1790 per month. If this individual didn't have to pay taxes, then at 35 hours per week and 4.3 weeks per month, I believe that a minimum wage of $12 per hour is fair.


What will not change my view:
""Minimum wage should be enough to take care of a family""

-Don't have kids if you're not ready to have them

-Nobody is making you take care of your family



edit: To provide more information. My belief in this matter is a compromise on the following:

-The free market (supply and demand) sets wages. If an employee is extremely easy to replace their wage should reflect that.

-Workers should have some standard of living and undercutting (saying you will work for much less) is anti-worker and is a practice that would reduce wages across the board for all workers. This practice should be kept in check and a way to this while providing some quality of life is a minimum wage.


edit 2: I am not interested in discussing how much employers should pay, as in the dollar value. I am here to discuss the reasoning that should be used to establish minimum wage. Also note that as it stands right now, if minimum wage is meant to cover these expenses, than it (the dollar value) is fine as it stands, atleast in Ontario, which is where I live.

"CMV: The light switch for a bathroom should be on the inside, not outside the door",1900,219,2018-09-17 01:53:02,"**Main reasons:**

* If you need to enter in the middle of the night and don't want to disturb anyone, you can be considerate and close the door before turning on the light (especially true in an ensuite bathroom)
* No one can turn the light out on you by accident or on purpose 
* If you know you need to turn on the fan, I would say its less embarrassing after entering the room and waiting a little while than projecting the fact you will stink up the room

*I'm open to being wrong, but any light switch on the outside of a bathroom is a horrible decision*

**Potential but unconvincing points against:**

* Its fun to turn the light out on people
* Its more instinctive to turn on the light before you walk into the small room, if its right next to the door frame 

**Qualification:**

* The switch has to be immediately adjacent to the opening of the door frame, otherwise its worse (addressed below)

**Edit:**

* Based on discussion thus far, I'd like to differentiate between a small number of bathrooms which may force builders to build outside the door (very small/multi function with shower, only space very far away, etc.) and the objective superiority of indoor-switches
* I would also accept, similar to the previous point, that it was more reasonable in old home. However, this is more an issue of what SHOULD be, in the best bathroom circumstances
* The humidity issue is strong, but I'd like evidence, especially as many bathrooms always include an electrical outlet, often without surge protection 

* Mind has been changed in the case of public bathrooms from the post by r/ralph-j but this remains a home-based discussion

CMV: Eating dogs is not wrong,1907,1695,2019-10-26 16:58:45,"You always see people demeaning those who have eaten or want to try eating dogs, while they eat beef or chicken themselves. 

They say dogs help us and all so we shouldn't eat them, but isn't that a bias based on your own beliefs about dogs? For eg: 

Hindus believe cows to be a sacred animal so in their opinion it's wrong to eat them but a hindu never stopped me from eating beef

Muslims believe pigs to be 'impure' animals that shouldn't be eaten but a muslim was never disgusted by me for eating pork 

So why should anyone judge another person's life choices(as long as it's legal)????

People tell vegans that they don't have the right to tell anyone what they should or not eat but aren't they doing the exact same thing?? 

Why the hell is eating one animal ethical and the other is not??? Aren't ethical values subjective anyway??

CMV: The outrage over Boeing 737MAX would have been alot worse if it was 536 Americans who died.,1900,107,2019-12-16 17:52:40,"My view is that the outrage was insufficient relative to how many died.. It was absolutely horrible how they died, and it was women and children as well, whole entire families. Think about different kinds of injustices, like the Costco cop shooting, or the young people who died in the GM Ignition switch recall, or the various mass shootings, or the girl who was murdered by the kid in NYC..They are all deserving of our sympathy and outpouring of care and thought. but the MAX crashes seemed to be devoid of that because they were .. Ethiopians and Indonesians. Well not so much that, but ""non-Americans"" more specifically. Yet it was an American company responsible.

This level of loss is staggering IMO and we really didn't care all that much. I'm glad that the administration grounded the MAX airplane, but Boeing is a complete shit show and as Americans we should be furious ,and we should take the lives of the 536 ethopians and indonesians as if they were our own families and our own children who died.

[Lion Air Flight 610](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion_Air_Flight_610): 189 dead
[Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopian_Airlines_Flight_302): 346 dead

The fact that the MAX is so clearly designed [improperly](https://www.vox.com/videos/2019/4/15/18306644/boeing-737-max-crash-video) makes me wish the executives were brought up on murder charges. Same thing with the GM ignition switch recall. Cutting corners.

"CMV: Star Wars isn't science fiction, it's fantasy in space",1902,291,2019-05-29 04:39:46,"I understand that, for many people, any story set in space would qualify as science fiction.

However, if we want to have a slightly more helpful definition of science fiction, we can say that it's a genre about exploring the consequences of some hypothetical technological, or even social, advancement. Most great science fiction stories that I can think of have this quality, whether we're talking about Isaac Asimov or *the Matrix*.

If that's true, then Star Wars wouldn't seem to qualify, since it's not interested in exploring anything about its setting beyond the superficial: space ships are things that get us from A to B fast (explained away through ""hyperdrive""), or things we use to shoot at other ships, etc. The ethical ramifications of the desire to build something like the Death Star, or the fascistic and genocidal tendencies of the Empire, aren't even really explored in any particular detail.

What the stories *are* about, in essence, is a battle of good versus evil and the wielders of good and bad magic that stand at the forefront of either of those sides. Which just happen to take place in space.

My view could be changed either by convincing me that there's more going on in Star Wars than I realize, or by convincing me that my definition of science fiction isn't tenable, or something else. I'm open to anything.

EDIT: Expanded on a couple points and tweaked grammar in a few places

EDIT 2: I should clarify that I am only speaking about the movies here. I don't have enough experience with the extended universe to be able to say one way or the other with those, but have already awarded a delta to someone who pointed out that the EU does have these qualities in some places.

EDIT 3: Hey guys, if you're going to respond, I'd really appreciate it if you checked the delta log first to see what points I've already conceded; I'm basically only getting responses right now that are trying to convince me of things I've already changed my mind about and awarded deltas over.

CMV: vehicle insurance costs should drop every month in relation with its depreciation.,1901,185,2018-03-10 03:05:17,"I think it is really unfair of insurance companies expecting us to pay the same premiums for our vehicles year after year when those premiums are based on the initial value when you sign up. Every time I speak to someone about car value I always get the same responses about it’s depreciation... that it’s inevitable and occurring with every single event that happens with the vehicle. Every mile driven, every new owner, every day it gets older and older, etc. If the company can come back 2 years later and tell me that the cars replacement value is only 74% of the original value then I should only be paying for 74% of the premium.

CMV: I think that not vaccinating your child is child endangerment and neglect.,1903,265,2018-08-29 16:27:07,I hold this opinion as I hear stories online about parents who seek help for their child and then when questioned about the child's medical history they say the child is unvaccinated. I think that not vaccinating your child is putting them in unnecessary danger as they become more at risk of contracting the illness that the vaccine would of stopped. This puts the child in unnecessary danger and could lead to serious medical complications and in extreme cases death. Because of this the parent who don't vaccinate should be charged with child endangerment and the child should be vaccinated with anything that they need and get put into the care of another family member. I know that putting more pressure on the prisons is not needed but a punishment needs to happen to the parents.,1
CMV: Disney has absolutely gutted the Star Wars franchise.,1898,487,2019-04-13 11:33:54,"I love Star Wars. Love the lore mainly but overall it's something I've grown up with my entire life. In just a few short years I have watched Disney destroy the lore and my expectations for anything good for Star Wars. My three main points:


1. Story. It is apparent that whomever is in charge of Star Wars does not care about it's characters or the direction of the series. Blatant destruction of story arks in Episode 8, literally rehashing a new hope for episode 7, and bringing back popular characters just to generate interest because their boring story can't carry weight. My point - what is the new trilogy even about: Rey? Her parents were ""no one"". Saving the Galaxy?  We haven't even seen the new republic from episode 6. There's no stakes. The new characters? Finn and his ridiculous obsession with Rey for no reason, and the love story from no where with no build up. It's BS.


2. The games. I like video games but the recent games from Disney are obvious cash grabs with no merit. The literal exact same game from 2005 had more content in it. Screw the graphics. Give me actual good game play.


3. No direction. From all the stories, games, and merch Disney is pushing there is no rhyme or reason, no direction for where the franchise is going. I don't know what to expect or what to be excited about. The answer is nothing.


My point: Disney has gutted and made hollow something I love. Please change my mind. Please Reddit, you're my only hope!",1
"CMV: While fatphobia and fat-shaming are a problem, studies that say being obese is unhealthy are not necessarily fatphobic for saying so.",1899,398,2018-08-15 00:12:08,"Full disclosure: I'm a healthcare professional, and I view this issue through what I perceive as a medical lens. I was recently [told off](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/979ois/comment/e46k3vo) for expressing fatphobic views, and I want to understand. I want to be inclusive, and kind to my fellow humans. It just seems like a bridge too far to me right now in my life. Of course, I've said that about a lot of things I've changed my mind about after learning more. Maybe this will be one of those things, but I have a lot to unpack about the values society has instilled in me.

I totally agree that there's a problem in our society with how we treat people with a higher than average body fat percentage. However, studies that find statistically significant correlation between obesity and adverse effects on cardiovascular health are not fatphobic for coming to those conclusions. It is well-established that sustained resting hypertension is detrimental to cardiovascular health. Being obese is positively correlated with hypertension at rest. The additional weight on the joints is also correlated with increased instances of arthritis. These results come from well-respected publications, and from well-designed, and well-conducted studies. Even with the bias that exists in the medical community against fat people, these studies are not necessarily wrong. For example: despite Exxon's climate denial - the studies they performed came to the same conclusions as more modern studies (even if they did not share the results with the public). Bias does not necessarily equate to bad science.",1
"CMV: In Christianity (and all its denominations) The Bible Portrays God as Immoral and Unrighteous, and Preists/Pastors Who Try to Explain Otherwise Only Give Weak and Fallible Arguments.",1900,610,2019-11-23 14:48:29,"I am a Roman Catholic(-ish). I went to a private Catholic High School for some time, I received first communion when I was seven, and confirmation when I was six, and previously went to bible school every Saturday night to learn about the bible and mass. I don't necessarily believe in the God that has been presented towards me, in fact I dare say I don't know what I believe in as of currently; however, my belief in God does not change the argument that has been laid down. Now that the exposition of who I am is out of the way, let me explain my position. 

First off, I am not attacking the Christian Church, nor its practices (though I do have strong feelings towards **American Christianity** in specific) this claim is only  referring to the Holy Bible itself, I could even extend this argument to Judaism, and Islam, as they all share the same beliefs of the old testament (at least generally) - where the majority of my argument will reside. 

I want to get out of the way a few counter arguments that I will not find acceptable (arguments that priests have given me in the past):

# God is a non-human being, therefore does not need to practice human morals.

This is a claim that God is a higher being then humans themselves. That he is one that humans cannot begin to comprehend, one that is in a completely separate category then humans are, and therefore (because he is higher then us) it is his right to treat us accordingly to his will. If it is true that God created humans and also created the moral laws in which humans need to abide by, then by humans standards, if God breaks the moral code, then he is being not only immoral, but hypocritical, and the hypocrisy factor is what adds the second layer to why God breaking his own law is morally impermissible. Any arguments that say: ""God is always right because he is omniscient,"" or anything similar is a logically circular argument, and is question begging. 

# When God is seemingly mistreating you, it is simply a test of your faith. 

This is a claim that states that God never really has any negative intentions in any thing that he directly or indirectly does, but he instead is testing your will and faith towards him by discomforting the human. Testing faith is not something to be done with pain, and if faith is tested via harming or causing the other person discomfort or pain, then it is immoral because it uses the person only as a means to your personal ends. (Kantian bias) If when in a relationship, one of the partners decides to test their significant other's faith by pretending to cheat on them, or trying to get them to cheat on you via seduction, it is immoral, so why is God morally allowed to harm humans to test their faith, and my answer is that it is not.

# God is right (morally permissible), even when he is wrong.

From a logical standpoint this makes no sense, and is flat out wrong. In a black and white standpoint, something cannot be true, while it is also false. However, I will entertain the idea that the meaning is more of: ""something is right even when it seems to be wrong,"" which is a logically acceptable statement. My counter argument for this is an argument that is not very strong, however i find it stronger then the initial argument of God's ""rightness"" itself, and that is that we as humans, even under God, have the right to have a collective subjective opinion towards what is right and wrong, and this why we study ethics. And because God claims to give us free will (though this also disputed), and we have the right to believe in a human subjective opinion, therefore we can obviously distinguish what decisions are and are not morally permissible, even at a Godly level. 

# ""That was not the point of the story""

Regardless of how the story ends or what the story means, I want to claim that God acted immoral in some way or another to receive some sort of teaching by the end of the story, regardless of how the story played out, I believe that some of his actions are - in one way or another - morally impermissible, therefore the moral of the story plays no effect in my argument. 

&#x200B;

Now to my main argument, which is that the Bible portrays God as Immoral. For this I'm not going to cite specific quotes (as the translations and differences in religions/denominations all slightly vary) instead I want to allude to some of the Bible's stories itself. I also want to point out that 

# The Story of Abraham and Isaac

In this ""test of faith"" story goes that God asked Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac in order to prove this faith to God. Now, many religions have extremely different interpretations on God's Intentions of the sacrifice, but I will not go that far into the story as to share its moral. The story ends by God, (or an angel) stopping Abraham from killing Isaac and offering up a Ram instead. 

God gave humans a rule specifically to not kill anyone. However it is apparently morally permissible to break this rule iff God himself gave the ""Divine Command"" to do so. This in itself is not only hypocritical but also morally impermissible, by God's and Humans' rulings. God had no reason to ask for the attempted murder of one of his children. There are other, more righteous ways, in which God could have handled Abraham's faith other then asking for the murder of his son, regardless of what his intentions are to asking the task.

# The Story of Job

Here is a story that I bring up a lot, and get the ""That was not the point of the story"" argument. Job was a man who had faith in God, and lived a good and wealthy life with many kids and was in prosperity. To test his faith, God made a deal with the Devil (be it was apparently the Devil's idea rather then Gods, but I don't see as to why that matters) that the Devil may do anything he wanted to Job in evil to test his faith to God, whatever the Devil does it cannot kill Job himself. 

What ends up happening is Job losing everything. His family was killed, farm brutalized, and his wealth evaporated, but in the end of the story Job gets everything back because he stayed faithful to God through hardships. 

The reason I find this morally impermissible is that God was the one who indirectly caused these hardships. Again, with testing faith, God made the decision that he will serious F\*\* up one of his followers lives for the pure reason of seeing his reaction towards it. Another step is the question of if Job hadn't stayed faithful to God? Would God have punished him even more for... well for being punished by God? God used his follower, his child, as a means to his personal end game in a deal with the Devil, which is morally impermissible

# Contradictions In The Bible

Here is not a specific story this time but contradictions of different points from around the Bible. To set up this argument I want to make it clear the belief that God has complete control over humans, meaning that he has the ability to affect their lives by either creating them in a certain way or affecting a certain condition. 

1. The discrimination against other religions - If God indeed created each child and had control over humans in the first place why birth any children to other religions? Why let humans tickle the possibility of other **fake Gods?** If God is to do this and allow this, then he must also not discriminate over the belief of false Gods, as he was the one who had complete control of the creation, and the spreading of these religions. 
2. The discrimination of other humans - Homosexuality (disputed), Women, and those born with lesser then others, or in unfortunate circumstances (a leper) should not be treated differently by God, nor judged differently, as he created them. 
3. ""Thou shalt love tho neighbor as thyself... except when (x, y, z)"" \[Disclaimer: This is ONLY for Christianity, as it is only portrayed in the new testament\] Not my strongest argument as it derives sources from both the old and new testament, but the main argument is that God tells to always love your neighbor, however commonly contradicts in saying that others are okay not to love. 

# List of non-comprehensive arguments/examples (for the sake of time)

* God wiping the world void from Moses (though he does feel remorse for this action).
* God punishing Eve, even though he knew that Eve had the capacity to sin, as he had created her.
* Killing Egyptian first born sons during Passover. 
* God Killing half a million people (in Chronicles)
* God Killing people because people were complaining that God was killing too many people
* Killing wife and children for worshiping other Gods
* Forced Cannibalism (Leviticus & Jeremiah)
* The Foretelling of Mass Genocide in Exodus

&#x200B;

I wan't to make clear that I am not asking for a reason as to why God is or is not a perfect being, or even if God is or is not a perfect being, and/or if the Bible defends him as one, but am seeking if my view of God's Immoral-ism can be changed.

CMV: Using CSS or other means to disable the downvote button is just another form of vote manipulation and should be stopped.,1897,231,2017-05-12 22:53:32,"Vote manipulation to me means any method of changing the vote count on a post other than a legitimate user having an opinion on a post and voting accordingly. This can be done in any direction, up or down. By preventing people from clicking the downvote button in subreddits with CSS, you are causing some people to not vote because they do not want to upvote, and they can't downvote due to the button missing. This is clearly changing the vote count and therefore is vote manipulation in the positive direction, but still vote manipulation.

I'm sure some people will say ""but they can disable CSS or user mobile!"". This is true and I will admit it is a solution, but to me it's not good enough. I'm sure a certain amount of people (myself included) disable CSS on subreddits simply for the ability to downvote. But since a large amount of people don't want to lose CSS permanently, a large amount of would-be downvotes are lost.

It just seems unethical and almost ""safe space""-esque to disable the downvote button in any way. What, if any, legitimate reason could a subreddit have for disabling the downvote button?

CMV: claiming gender is a made up social construct directly conflicts the idea that we should honor people's preferred genders,1889,547,2019-06-28 00:16:13,"I feel it's important to start with the fact that this doesn't come from a place of bigotry or prejudice. I am not here to discuss trans issues. My personal view is that people are allowed to do whatever they want. However, this post *does* come from a place of confusion and cognitive disconnect.

It seems to me that there are two separate and conflicting schools of thought:

1. Gender is completely made up and doesn't matter

2. People can be whatever gender they want, and you have to treat them as the gender they chose 

I have no issue with either of these beliefs. But it's the use of them together that doesn't make sense to me.

So, in a sentence, my problem is this: *Saying gender doesn't matter completely conflicts with demanding people address you by your chosen gender.*

As an analogy: you ask someone where they want to eat. They say it doesn't matter. You list a bunch of resteraunts. They say no to every option. So which is it? Does it not matter or do you actually have a preference?

Similarly, if gender is a made up social construct, why does it matter what people call you? Or else if it's important and respectful to use someone's preferred gender, then clearly gender matters.

Again, I must stress that I'm not stuck in this mind set. I believe my confusion stems from me missing some vital piece of the puzzle. I'm here to be educated.

CMV: Upvoting because of opinion is a much bigger problem on Reddit than downvoting because of opinion.,1889,195,2019-10-30 23:44:43,"I see this a lot particularly in r/askreddit, where a lot of the top posts of all time are ""How do you feel about [thing we all agree on]"" or perhaps worse "" people who [thing most people dislike] why?"" despite the fact that there will never be any rational answers.

People upvote posts they like the opinion of over posts that have content that is entertaining/insightful/whatever other things it should be.

Another example of this is a lot of meme subreddits, where it's becoming increasingly common to just screenshot a news article and put a generic response calling it stupid. These aren't funny, they're just agreeable.

Edit: From this point forward I will be referring to posts that are either insightful, entertaining, relevant, or whatever else may be good criteria for a post in that place as 'quality'. Agreeableness is not a factor in what I'll refer to as 'quality'

"CMV: My roommate, who is away for a month, should still pay all flat rate bills for that month",1891,423,2018-02-15 23:23:11,"My bills are Internet, gas, water, electric, and rent. My roommate, who is away for a month, says that he should only pay rent, as he is not using any of the other services. I say that he should still pay all of the flat rates, i.e. Internet, the service fees for utilities, and the surcharge on water. I have two chief arguments for this. 

First, him being away does not affect these at all. If I were not living here too, then he would still have to pay all of these fees. He is not able to simply shut off his water and Internet and such for a month, as we are contracted in. By agreeing with these companies to have these services, he locked us into paying at least $X per month in service fees. Even if we decided that we no longer need water and stopped using it, we would still have to pay these fees for a year. Therefore, him not using these services should have no bearing on whether or not he pays the service fees. EDIT This is assuming that we mutually agreed to these service, which we did. I would not use this argument if I had purchased cable TV that he did not want to begin with.

Second, these fees would have to be paid if I also left. For example, if I happened to plan a month-long vacation at the same time, we would both be away and both not using these services. However, someone would have to pay the bills. By assuming his argument true, neither of us are responsible for the bills. Yet, they must be paid by someone. Therefore, using proof by contradiction, I must be correct.

"CMV: We should put ""Don't be Shy, Say Hi"" stickers on laptops we use in public.",1892,563,2020-02-10 02:28:01,"Assumed is that we should talk to strangers more.  Isn't interacting with strangers in public healthy?  Isn't it a good way to learn social skills, feel out the locals, possibly make friends, or align and organize for a common politic?  

I go to coffee shops often and would talk to pretty much anyone but it's awkward to just walk up to someone and say, ""feel like chatting"" or whatever other fairly innocuous conversation starter.  One could just ask some question and jump right into it but engaging others this way is a skill and can be unwelcome.  How much easier if people had bling that signaled they want to be approached!  This is my thought.  Acting on this, I recently ordered a ""Don't be Shy, Say Hi"" sticker for my laptop.  I haven't tried it out yet, but figure it can't hurt.  Who knows if anyone will see it and accept the offer but I can say this, were I to see another sporting similar bling I'd make a point to say hi.  Who knows where it leads?

I could be wrong, maybe we shouldn't talk to strangers in public, but why?  Isn't it a great way to get outside our bubbles, at risk of giving or taking offense?  Or maybe the sticker will do nothing.  However, if people decide to look for and display such stickers then they will do something, so whether this bling is effective or not is up to us, no?

CMV: The current discourse surrounding pedophilia and viewing it as synonymous with child molestation is counterproductive and cause for otherwise preventable sexual offences,1888,687,2018-12-09 21:11:50,"***Disclaimer 0: Because apparently this hasn't been stressed enough... I don't want to give pedophiles child pornography. I don't want more pedophiles around children. I don't want to make child molestation legal. I don't want therapies that teach pedophiles that it's okay to act on urges. I want a cultural climate in which the existence of pedophilia as a sexual desire is recongnized and distinguished from the act of child molestation. For the purpose of them feeling safe enough to voluntarily and without fear of repercusions seek treatment that focuses on supressing desires and avoiding riskful situations and behaviours before they become offenders (again). Hope that clears things up.***

*Disclaimer 1: I’m not a pedophile but interested in/advocating for a more effective way to protect children. I’ve been in a happy relationship with an adult woman for several years now and never have viewed a child as anything other than I child. I only bring this up because there seem some people who will immediately jump to conclusions, as I’ve experienced. As it seems uncommon to use throwaways on here I will conform and use my regular profile, trusting the reddit community to take my words at face value.*

*Disclaimer 2: I’m not arguing for something like discussed during the sexual revolution in the 60s where there were proposals to decriminalize or legalize sex with children. It is thoroughly wrong in my opinion and I’m 100% for criminalizing child molestation and child abuse. To anyone who experienced this I’m deeply sorry for what you had to go through and I wholeheartedly understand if you’re disgusted by my position.*

**TL;DR**

Pedophilia is a sexual preference not consciously decided on or easily suppressed without treatment and professional help. The understandable stigmatizing of pedophilia leads to fear of pedophiles outing themselves and seeking effective help. Simultaneously it prevents policy makers to supply funds for the research and implementation for effective therapies as it would seem weak on or sympathizing with pedophiles.

**Intro**

I bring this up because of a post yesterday in which I’ve advocated for something similar – though not as explicit as here – and faced a lot of negative reactions. My goal is, in the best scenario, to see if I’m missing some benefit of the tabooing and shaming of pedophilic tendencies and change my view accordingly or – at least – to find an underlying rational that would oppose my view on a different level than an emotional one.

**Definition**

I’m talking about pedophilia and pedophiles in a medical sense here, not following the common usage of the word as synonymous with child molester. This means anyone who feels sexually attracted to prepubescent children. I’m diverging from the common medical definition in the sense that I’m also including people attracted to adolescents during puberty because it applies similarly and is, in my opinion, something that should be prevented.

**Fear of outing themselves preventing treatment**

In our current climate I think it’s far to stigmatized to out yourself as a pedophile even for the purpose of getting therapy. Most people will react understandably disgusted when someone tells them he has pedophilic tendencies. This is problematic in the sense that a lot of pedophiles are deeply disgusted with their preferences themselves. [This article](https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/yvxkpv/realizing-youre-a-pedophile-can-make-you-want-to-kill-yourself) goes into a bit more detail about the whole situation, detailing the depression and suicidal thoughts faced by many pedophiles. Furthermore, it explains that a lot of pedophiles don’t want to commit the atrocity they are attracted to. But given the climate a lot of them will be too frightened to talk to their loved ones, GP or a specialist because of fear of getting judged (regardless if they molested a child already or only have difficulties suppressing their urge to).

Another problem with that is, that – I think – being continuously depicted as monstrous sexual offenders by society and internalizing that self view might actually decrease the threshold to become an offender. If everyone, including you, already thinks you’re more monster than men, why not just give in to it?

On the other side we have programs like [“Don’t offend”](https://www.dont-offend.org/story/home.html) spearheaded by the Charité university hospital in Berlin. The program has been widely praised in the field and by participiants as evident [by their review section](https://www.dont-offend.org/story/post-therapy.html). The options range from everything starting with group therapy to chemical castration if sought after by the pedophile and will help the partaking individuals to find the best ways on how to get ahead of their preferences and not wanting to satisfy their urges. Sadly, they have to invest a massive amount of resources in raising awareness and securing the anonymity of participants. Fear of being somehow outed or only picking up leaflets somewhere will still cause that a lot of people – who would benefit from the program and not be as likely to become an offender – will never go there, despite the track record. And I can blame them:

>One British man was so desperate, he moved to Germany to be able to access a Dunkelfeld programme. In an email exchange with the Guardian, the man, who wished to remain anonymous, wrote: “So far, all I have ever received from the NHS is doors slammed in my face. “Despite paedophilia being listed as a mental illness in the DSM (the standard classification of mental disorders), they don’t want to help you, they just want to see you locked up or perhaps even burnt at the stake. I am so sick and tired of UK medical ‘professionals’ looking at me as if I’ve grown horns and a barbed tail.” ([Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/oct/16/how-germany-treats-paedophiles-before-they-offend))

**Law- and policymakers can't support therapy programs**

This actually brings me to my second point, policy makers fearing to back programs like this out of fear of being labeled to sympathize with sex offenders. There is an effective therapy that will lead to keeping children safe but, as it focuses on preventing offenders from offending instead of the victims, it faces an uphill battle.

Programs like that are unlikely to get implemented because the regulations for keeping the identities of pedophiles in therapy isn’t possible in a lot of countries. In many countries they couldn’t even be effectively be therapized because, if they already became an offender and not want to offend again, the couldn’t be open about what they’ve done, which is necessary for therapy, because the psychologist would legally be required to alert the police. Changes in these laws seem unlikely because of the optics it would’ve if a politican proposed something like that.

Same goes for the funding of these projects or research in that area. Gladly that program in Berlin is backed by the German administration but, as far as my experience goes, most people voting for that administration don’t know that the CDU/SPD supports this in their program and will be offended or downright angry because of it. This is only possible because of a consensus to keep quite about this by politicians of all over the spectrum and the media. However, if I imagine something like this in the US I just can't picture a world where FOX News wouldn’t call for the heads of the party writing something like this in their official agenda.

So, change my view.

A lack of accountability would leave private schools able to progress students through the education system without preparing them properly or by teaching them biased material. 

She has ~~no prior education~~ almost no prior *public* education (thanks /u/stargazerAMDG) managerial experience.

I want to have an actual conversation with someone who understands the other side of this argument in light of her confirmation. Please help convince me that this confirmation is not horrible for our education system and America's children. ",1
CMV: Higher Quality Education For Free Would Result In An Overall Higher Quality Of Life,1886,323,2018-07-03 23:02:06,"The high-level general view of regarding available education as more crucial to our quality of life.

When digging into surface-level issues, I often come to the underlying issue being ignorance from a lack of education.   
Even in the instance of just being taught 'what to think', and not 'how to think'.  

I often come to the best resolution being more prominent support from the availability & quality of education's role in people's lives.  I'm not saying it would be perfect or flawless, but would result in an overall higher quality for the community.

CMV: There was nothing anti-military about Kaepernick’s kneeling protest,1882,696,2018-09-23 15:44:06,"There is nothing about Kap kneeling during the national anthem that could reasonably be construed as disrespect to the troops. There is no situation I am aware of in any culture where the act of kneeling is used to show anything other than respect. Those who believe that Kap hates the military are simply choosing to associate his protest with disrespect for the troops, which allows them to freely hate him without having to really look at the reason for his protest. 

The protest began as a means of drawing attention to racial inequality and police brutality: two things that most people probably ought to be against. By focusing on an imaginary link between the protest and the sacred cow of “the troops” his detractors aren’t forced to consider or debate the issue. They likely believe that the US treats black people either as equal to or better than white people, and that most or all incidents of police violence against black people are justified. Everything about the troops is just post-hoc rationalization.",1
CMV: I think Wall-E is the most plausible dystopian future for the human species. (Not 1984),1883,243,2017-08-08 22:03:55,"I am only half kidding when I say that, but at the same time, I would make perfect sense to me. I know a lot of people like to throw out '1984' or 'A Brave New World' as possibilities for a dystopian future. However, to me, I think with global warming, social interactions and obesity being as prevalent as they are... Well, you see where I am going. 
For those of you who are out of the loop, Wall-E is about humans embarking into space after trashing our planet. Generations in space left their bone mass to near nothing, and their BMI off the charts. They never talk to each other, instead they spend all of their time in front of a screen, much like now. All the characters are obese, and they get around their space ship by moving chairs. At the end of the film, the captain is applauded for just standing up. 
Now, in my only 25 years of life, and having lived most of my life in the US, I can see this panning out now. More than two-thirds of Americans are over-weight or obese. On average, Americans watch 5 hours and 4 minutes of TV daily (according to the New York Times). Now, all of us living on a space ship with cute little robots might be a stretch, but we are getting fatter and we put in our screen time.
Lastly, and in my opinion, the saddest part of the movie is the lack of social interactions. Again, I am 25 and American. Not that I am saying I am an old timer, but it does seem as though we spend more time in isolation in front of a screen. I remember as a kid, my parents and a lot of my friends parents almost forbid us from spending all our time inside. My parents had me in as many sports, activities and gatherings as they felt it would help my social development. Did it? Na, I hate people. But still, they tried. 
MY nephew and niece (10 and 5, respectively) spend ALLLLLL DAMMMMNN DAYYYY in front of a screen. They are still pretty thin, as when I baby sit those little monster I take them to the park to burn off energy. My niece's friend's parents (sorry, that is a mouth full) don't do that. They are chubby, anti-social, little kids. It honestly hurts my heart. But, I feel this is our future. For the love that is holy, please CMV. Even though I don't really like kids, I really want them all to be happy and healthy. I really do believe they are our future, and all I want for our species is happiness and prosperity. I just think we aren't on the right path.
TLDR; I think we are getting fat, anti-social and are destroying our planet. I think we might end up like Wall-E, minus the spaceship.

"CMV: Conversation is the only way to change someone's mind, argumentation almost never, ever works. This is why the majority of protests in the United States will get nothing done.",1869,228,2018-03-03 03:25:24,"Note: I believe that semantically, ""arguing"" implies that the ""winner"" has shown dominance and subordinates the ""loser,"" while ""conversing"" implies that there is no winner or loser, which allows for more acceptance of ideas.

Have you ever been mad at someone in an argument, and realized you were wrong halfway through? Odds are you didn't admit you were wrong. People don't ever want others to subordinate them.

But in a calm discussion, have you ever been convinced of a new idea? I imagine you have. 


I believe the reason groups like the alt-right exist is because many white men feel that they aren't even given a chance to converse, but are argued against. OR, they have no interest in conversation in the first place and only want to argue in the first place- both are realistic pathways. 

Two of the most influential rights activists of all time- Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.- strictly advocated for non-violence, but did advocate for civil disobedience. This would both take away the oppressors ability to subordinate their group, AND show no willingness to subordinate the oppressor. That is part of the reason why their movements were so rapid and successful.

As a white man, I fully recognize I have an unfair advantage in many walks of american culture. However, I have had my accomplishments straight up diminished and discredited because of my ""white male"" privilege. **I am not saying this is wrong. But it is a direct attack on something I take pride in. Naturally, a direct attack on something someone takes pride in is subordination.** When this happens, of course I get emotionally invested, and I am incapable of having a proper disscussion afterwards. 

Unfortunately, many of the loudest voices in activism tend to subordinate white men, and this is why white men end up in the echo chamber that is the alt-right. 

_______________________________________

*TLDR*

I want equal opportunity for all, and I know that currently we do not have that in this country. The fastest way to change that is activism and I fully support those who advocate and fight for their opportunity. However, to do so requires empowerment of the oppressed, never the subordination of the oppressor.

Cmv: landlords need a rating system,1863,144,2020-03-01 04:57:07,"We all hear about the nightmare tenants. A minority of people that ruin properties, defy leases, live gross, or disrupt other tenants. But landlords arent all good either. 
The invention of the landlord tenant act has helped make it possible for both parties to settle disputes but some landlords are way worse than the worst tenants. I'm sick of trying to reach out to my landlord about a leaking roof that causes mold over time, who doesnt want to put money into their own property or ignored messages. I pay my rent. I dont disrupt my neighbours. I clean up after my dog. And yet every landlord I've dealt with gives the impression to me that I'm less than they are just pay rent and piss off. 

The landlord tenant act is good but it's not enough. Renting properties is a legitimate business. Why is there not a way to rate landlords to hold them accountable in the communities like google rates restaurants? Bad landlords should be driven out of business.

Edit: some comments have tried to differentiate between review and ratings. To clarify, although they are functionally different my view would be that they are intrinsic to each other as you wouldnt be able to properly rate without a reason why to reduce malicious attempts on reputations, legal implications, etc. And although its acknowledged that most reviews would be negative that is based on assumptions. It could presumably generate positive reviews as well.",1

With cameras all over our world, surely something convincing would have been caught if they were. Instead we're filled with 'I got  feeling', orbs that are clearly dust or bugs and edited photos and videos. 

Sure there's loads of stories around the internet but no one can actually back it up with evidence. I just can't believe that in a world where everything is recorded no one has managed to find proof. A bang on the door after you've asked them to knock 400 times (and edited the first 399 out) doesn't count. That's just coincidence.

Clinton clearly outlined the exact steps of her plans, and what she wanted to do on a given issue. Trump either didn't present a policy (ISIS, Aleppo), or presented a rhetoric based entirely on vague (MAGA), or blatantly false (Climate change is a hoax) pretense.

This actually causes the media to be *less* neutral by giving undeserved credence to Trump's platform, but comparing it as equal to Clinton's.

There are other issues where the media does the same thing by bringing in a dissenting view on issues that have been factually proven and concluded. In other words, there is no rational dissenting view for:

* Climate change is caused by humans.

* The Earth was created billions of years ago, not thousands.

* No race is intellectually superior to another.

This perpetuation of false equivalencies misleads the public into thinking that two things are equal and opposite, as opposed to unequal.

"CMV: The US government is very bad at keeping secrets from it's people, and any knowledge of extraterrestrial life would be leaked",1854,282,2020-02-27 12:11:39,"Conspiracy theorists and alien enthusiasts routinely posit the existence of covert government programs which are in possession of either aliens, their craft, or just knowledge of their existence. They go on to explain that the reason we lack proof of these activities is a systematic and exhaustive program of concealment, intimidation, and 'psyops' disinformation campaigns. In my opinion, the easiest way to weed out most conspiracy theories is to consider the plausibility of the cover-up.

If it involves something publicly salient then people will be inclined to talk / leak it. By publicly salient I mean something the average citizen cares about. Like domestic surveillance, prison abuse, aliens, etc. The military can keep technical secrets all day long. Regular people don't give a shit about how fast a new missile can fly, and have no context for the information. 700mph? OK.

Abu Ghraib was a secret military prison in the middle of a war zone and we got pictures of it. Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden, and Julian Assange were all willing to endanger their freedom and safety to expose goverment surveillance and secrecy. MKUltra was a secret program the CIA director himself tried to destroy all record of and it still got out. I could go on and on.

If we had any alien material it would be the biggest technology endeavor since the Manhattan Project - which was barely kept secret. The Germans and Soviets quickly knew something about it and were aggressively infiltrating. But the Manhattan Project only had to be kept secret for 3 years before the core truth was revealed. And it was kept secret during WWII when the public was (a) distracted by the war, (b) loyal and conscientious about secrecy, and (c) limited to official (government censored) news channels.

Try putting 130,000 people on a project now and keep it secret. Impossible. None of the conditions that enabled wartime secrecy in WWII exist now. The public is eager to hear secrets exposed and truths revealed. And people are eager and able to give it to them. Now imagine keeping it secret for *decades*. Roswell happened in 1947. If we had aliens for 73 years that's 3 *generations* of scientists, techs, guards, and officials on the project. All kept quiet even through retirement and deathbeds?

Conspiracists claim that the government (or the boogieman *du jour*) is good at silencing people. No it's not. It's terrible at it. America is actually really fucking free. Bob Lazar, for example, claims that the MIB erased the record of his attendance at MIT and Caltech, and that witnesses were bullied into denying ever knowing him. Can you imagine a federal agent trying to tell a tenured professor at an elite university that he can't say something? You could silence one private citizen or another if they're in a vulnerable position, but on any kind of scale the conspiracy breaks down.

Lastly, Trump couldn't keep his Ukraine deal secret. You think he's keeping his lips sealed on ET? He couldn't not tweet about it. He'd die. OK maybe they don't tell him.",1
CMV: As a trans person I believe that current trans activism has completely lost the plot. They will lose much of the public debate they choose to engage in due to their overly radical agenda.,1853,548,2017-02-19 21:57:15,"My argument is largely philosophical so it's somewhat malleable and I legitimately would like yo see it changed. I would prefer to believe in and support current trans activism whole-heartedly but far too often find myself shaking my head instead. There's a few points on which I base my contention:

~~**As a trans woman I do not believe that I am biologically female and I dont believe that I should have to be to access women's spaces.** I'm female like and function well enough as one. I look female. I experience much of if not the majority of the same baggage as biological females. I'm more physically like a female than a male and pose about as much danger to females as any other female due to the effects of hormones. Despite this I know that if nature had been left to its own devices I would have been completely capable of reproducing through the production of male sex gametes: sperm. Furthermore I still have male reproductive organs, they've simply been switched off by the effects of long term hormone replacement therapy and potentially could function completely again on the cessation of hormones. I think it is an inherently unwinnable fight to argue that I am biologically female based on nothing more than the (potential and unproven) configuration of my brain hardware.~~

~~**I have seen trans activism push an agenda that states that biological sex is an entirely socially constructed concept based on the existence of intersex people.** I think this makes about as much sense as saying that because Orange exists, red and yellow aren't real colors. Biological sex is at its core about sex gametes. In the absence of a reproductive system that functionally produces one, its relatively easy to deduce which gamete a person's biology was *intended* to  produce,  even in the presence of the overwhelming majority of intersex conditions, and even at an extreme enough end that you can argue an intersex person is not neatly either male or female, males and females still exist independent of them.~~

~~**How this hurts trans activism goals:** If trans activism spent less time trying to convince people that biological sex is made up and more time educating people about the effects hormones have on trans bodies I believe that we would be much further into achieving our social and political goals by now. I believe that we are bogged down in an unwinnable and inherently disingenuous fight. We are driving away people who believe in rationalism and science a la people who would actually be very receptive to treating transgenderism as a medical condition with a very specific and unorthodox  treatment regimen and instead of trying to sway them with an argument that appeals to their natures we are fighting them with unscientific rhetoric.~~

**Edit: I have actually changed my view at this point regarding biological sex. /u/convoces raised to me a really good point that if you can point to an exception within your paradigm, then the scientifically honest thing to do is rethink your paradigm. If 100% of cases do not work within it, then it was too broad. I've come to believe that sex is nuanced, and while someone might not necessarily fall within a strict ""female"" category, that does not necessarily indicate that they are males. Rather biological sex is a mix of different characteristics which are not always able to be defined neatly, and the social role a person lives in is as important if not more important than potentially invisible characteristics.**

**I have seen trans activists push a ""genitals don't matter"" argument when it comes to sex and dating.** While I do not believe that a man dating a preop trans woman is ""gay"", genitals are very important to many people when it comes to sex. Trans activism states that this reduces people solely to their genitals, but it's frankly terrifyingly batshit to argue to people that the parts used in sex should not matter when it comes to sex. It is not transphobic for someone to not want a particular configuration of genitals in their bedroom. That is their prerogative.

**How this hurts trans activism:** I have seen lesbians show up in /r/relationships and /r/asktransgender threads describing being shamed and ostracized by their friends for not wanting to sleep with trans women.  I have seen gay men do the same regarding trans men. The LGB community has typically had a strong association with the T community and they are all potential allies. We are united in the ways we are stigmatized. Yet, when we are the ones doing the stigmatizing we risk alienating them from our cause.

~~**And lastly I have seen trans activists argue that you do not need to be gender dysphoric to be transgender, merely self identified as something other than your birth sex.** This fundamentally makes no sense and runs contrary to the entire pathology of what it means to be transgender. It's as fundamentally incorrect as arguing that gay men dont have to be sexually attracted to men to be gay, you just have to self identify. Gender dysphoria is integral to shaping a transgender identity. This particular argument seems purely ideological: that people should be allowed to identify as whatever sex they feel like because gender is dead and anything goes. I believe at minimum this actually reinforces sexist gender roles since believing that because you are effeminate or gender non-conforming as a man (or the inverse as a woman) actually makes you the other sex or a third sex undermines the progress feminism has made to insist that women can be masculine and still women or that men can be feminine still men. ~~

~~**How this hurts trans activism:** after countless conversations with cis opponents of pro-trans bathroom laws I've come to the conclusion that most cisgender people could care less what someone who has transitioned does and where they go the bathroom. Their primary fear comes from the wording typically being used: ""the gender they identify as"". Cis people are most afraid of there being no standards whatsoever imposed on access to sex segregated spaces. When we're arguing that there should be no bare minimum standards for being identified as the opposite sex we are playing directly into those fears. When cis people are afraid that men will ""wake up and decide they are a woman"" why are we arguing ""that's not how it works!"" then turning around and in different conversations arguing that its exactly how it works?~~

~~**In summation:** I believe that by embracing radical and untrue tenents based on ideological goals rather than objective reality trans activism is actually driving away potential supporters and otherwise reasonable people who could be potential allies.~~

**Edit: Thanks to /u/iyzie pointing out the scary possibility or republican lawmakers being charged by the evangelical right with determining who is and isn't transgender enough I've partially changed my view on ""non-dysphoric trans people"". I haven't necessarily changed my view that they are not actually transgender people, only that it is dangerous to start drawing lines in the sand to determine who is and is not legitimate, and that once you establish that power for a reasonable group it becomes easier for unreasonable groups to seize that power. So what I have changed my view on is that trans activists pushing the view that ""anyone can be trans"" is not necessarily harmful because they are rightfully trying to avoid a legitimate slippery slope.**

CMV: Universal Basic Income is Superior to a Jobs Guarantee,1847,441,2019-05-28 18:20:50,"#Introduction  
  
I've been paying a lot of attention to the US 2020 elections, and in particular some of the policies brought forward by the various candidates. Two policies in particular that I think are worth examining in more detail are Bernie Sanders' [federal jobs guarantee](https://berniesanders.com/issues/jobs-for-all/) and Andrew Yang's [UBI](https://yang2020.com/freedom-dividend). I think they are interesting in that they are two solutions to the same problem — runaway capitalism — but I ultimately think that of the two a universal basic income is the superior solution. I have been a fan of UBI for a while now (not sure when I first heard of it, but I liked it since I did), so I admit to some pro UBI bias, and I disliked a job guarantee from the moment I heard of it, so I admit an anti JG bias. In the spirit of epistemic hygiene, I would lay out why I oppose a jobs guarantee, why I think a UBI is counterfactually better (I would be light in my pro UBI section because of length), and what could convince me to change my mind.   
  
Before we begin, I'd like you to take not of the fact that I said ""counterfactually better"". I am not claiming that the status quo is better than a jobs guarantee, but that a universal basic income program is better than a jobs guarantee. To defend a jobs guarantee, it's not sufficient to make the case that warts and all it's superior to the status quo, you must make the case that it's superior to a universal basic income. The world you'd be comparing a jobs guarantee to isn't the status quo but a world with universal basic income.

#Why I Oppose a Federal Jobs Guarantee.  
  
##A Note on Incentives
Before I lay the case for why I am opposed to a jobs guarantee, I would like to talk about my beliefs regarding incentives as they are central to why I oppose job guarantees. A defense of these beliefs would be worth it's own post, so I wouldn't lay out the motivation for these beliefs, and would instead just lay out the beliefs themselves. I do not take these beliefs as axiomatic, so it is not fruitless to argue against them (though I would prefer you didn't do that as the burden of evidence required for me to meaningfully change my mind on this is much higher), but your efforts would be better served attacking the arguments against a job guarantee directly. That said, these are my beliefs:     
  
* Most humans largely have the same preferences: Most of us have the same basic needs: food, shelter, clothing and similar wants: higher status, happiness, happiness for our loved ones, etc. There's variation in specifics (e.g different preferences in types of houses, but we do prefer houses generally).
* Most problems in complex systems involving humans can be explained using incentives. Systematic bad behaviour is often as a result of incentive structures, which incentivise undesirable behaviour amongst members of the system. [It's rarely as a result of personal moral failings of members of the system]().  
* As a corollary to the above, most successes in complex systems involving humans can be explained using incentives. Systematic good behaviour is often as a result of incentive structures, which incentivise desirable behaviour amongst members of the system. [It's rarely as a result of personal moral uprightness of members of the system]().  
* From the above, I conclude that the best way to improve complex human systems is to change the extant incentives rather than to change the people involved (either by replacement or modifying their utility function directly). If your plan requires people to be especially moral to be effective then it's a shite plan. The desired outcome(s) should occur even when the individuals involved have no moral/personality idiosyncrasies, as a result of the incentives in place.  
  
&nbsp;  
  
##The Case Against a Jobs Guarantee  
  
I am not a gainst a jobs guarantee because of the ""jobs"" part, but largely because of the ""guarantee"" part. Assuming that the ""guarantee"" implies that workers can't be fired (excluding extraneous circumstances) and there's strong job security, a jobs guarantee perverts the incentive structures. it decouples employee productivity from employee compensation, and removes any incentive employees have to be productive at their workplace. Without an incentive to be productive, employees would be counterfactually much less productive than they would be under private employment. One could argue that employee productivity is already decoupled from employee compensation, but I would counter that while there isn't a very strong positive correlation between productivity and compensation, the two are largely still correlated. For example, higher productivity may lead to bonuses, promotions, raises, stock options (or rise in company valuation for employees who have stock options), more benefits, etc. On the other hand, lower productivity may lead to no bonuses, less benefits, lowered wages, demotions, getting fired. The private sector generally tracks some measure of employee productivity, and it seems to factor into decision making. They are also incentivised to reward higher productivity (and punish lower productivity) so it's what you would expect.  
  
The above leads to a situation in which the average employee in a jobs guarantee program is less productive than a similarly compensated employee in the private sector. This makes the economy less efficient as a whole, and as each jobs guarantee employee is one less private sector employee there is a reduction in overall productivity. Furthermore, there are allocative inefficiencies, as employees in jobs programs may not be matched to the most appropriate application of their skills (granted this would also occur in the private sector, but a jobs guarantee would exacerbate it) further depressing economic output. 
  
Furthermore, employing several tens of millions of people (a number that would only rise as [accelerating technological advancement displaces](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610005/every-study-we-could-find-on-what-automation-will-do-to-jobs-in-one-chart/) [more and more private sector employees](https://www.axios.com/automation-jobs-replace-united-states-location-8a2f02d4-cfd8-4310-af73-b61c71871938.html)) has massive bureaucracy. A lot of resources would be expended merely administering all the workers. This giant bureaucracy would likely incentivise systematic inefficiency and lead to even more resource waste.  
  
To make matters worse, workers admitted into a jobs guarantee program may find it exceedingly difficult to transition to the private sector (federal employees already find transitioning to the private sector difficult, but a jobs guarantee may make this worse due to skill atrophy as a result of the lowered productivity). This creates a class of workers dependent on the government for sustenance. This would make ending the jobs guarantee program difficult in the future (as it would lead to significant hardship for tens of millions of people) and entrenches the inefficiency. Ultimately, this reduces the jobs guarantee program to workfare (welfare with a work requirement, like the [Victorian workhouses]()). We are left with a ginormous bureaucracy that is woefully inefficient and wastes both the government's resources and workers.  
  
To top it all off, workers in a jobs guarantee program are out of luck if they dislike their assigned jobs. However, as they'e dependent on it, they're unlikely to quit. As the dependent population would only continue to grow as more and more people are displaced from the workforce all the above problems would become progressively worse.  
  
&nbsp;  
  
##The Case For a Jobs Guarantee  
  
The main advantages of a jobs guarantee I see are:  
  
1. Cost: It would be less expensive than a universal basic income program.  
2. Labour: The government gains access to a steady and reliable labour force for various projects like infrastructure development, climate change, etc.  
  
The first is a point in a jobs guarantee's favour (though it would grow faster than a UBI as each displaced private sector worker is one more jobs guarantee worker). As for the second, a normal jobs program without the guarantee part seems superior (all the advantages without many of the disadvantages). As I said before, I am not opposed to jobs programs. Ultimately it seems to me that the only advantage of a jobs guarantee over a universal basic income is cost, and I think the benefits of UBI and the disadvantages of a jobs guarantee tip the scale in UBI's favour.

#Why I Support Universal Basic Income  
  
[There are many](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/why-we-should-all-have-a-basic-income/) [reasons to support](https://www.basicincome.org.uk/reasons-support-basic-income) [universal basic income](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/why-should-we-support-the_b_7630162) [on its own](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2017/02/15/three-reasons-for-universal-basic-income/), or [as an alternative to a jobs guarantee](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/16/basic-income-not-basic-jobs-against-hijacking-utopia/) and I don't really want to rehash here what you can read elsewhere, so I just linked them above, and below I'll formulate the arguments most relevant to me.  
  
The SSC article goes into more detail about this (if you read only one link above, read that one), but a UBI helps many classes of people that a jobs guarantee does not: (disabled, caretakers, parents)
  
In my case against a jobs guarantee, I mentioned that a jobs guarantee would likely lead to a reduction in economic output. UBI does the exact opposite. By putting money directly into the hands of everyone, UBI acts as a massive financial stimulus to the economy. Most of the people who receive UBI would spend a lot of their extra income, and that money would go to others who would also spend some of the money, so the fiscal multiplier would be high. The increased money in circulation would likely result in a significant increase in economic ouftput. A study by the Roosevelt institute on $1,000/mo predicted a permanent 12.5% rise in GDP after 8 years.  
  
Furthermore, UBI is likely to increase productivity not only compared to a jobs guarantee world, but also compared to the current one. UBI gives workers financial independence. No longer dependent on their employers (government and private sector alike) for sustenance they are are free to identify the jobs best suited to their particular skillsets. Milton Friedman said: ""no one spends another's money as wisely as he spends his own"", as a corollary to that I would say: ""no one spends another's labour as wisely as they spend their own"". The financial independence provided by a UBI would drastically reduce the allocative efficiencies that would exist under a jobs guarantee program, and under the current system. This could result in a substantial increase in productivity. This in particular is one of the things that most excites me about a UBI.    
  
Administering a UBI has (relatively) very little bureaucracy involved, and much lower administrative costs. So there would be less wastage of resources (labour, capital, etc) in maintaining a UBI program. Admittedly, the monetary cost due to inefficiency in a jobs guarantee program would be offset by the greater expenses in a UBI program, but a UBI also does more, and the administrative workers maintaining the bureaucracy would be free to do more productive work.

#How to Change My Mind  
  
I admittedly haven't done much research into jobs guarantees, so I expect that there are things I am wrong on, misunderstanding or whose impact I'm incorrectly estimating. I think it would be easier to shift my mind on a jobs guarantee than on UBI (not as much as for incentives, but I am pretty firmly in the pro UBI camp and the burden of evidence required to change that is pretty high) so I'll focus on that in this section.  
  
I'll be more favourable towards a jobs guarantee if:  
  
* The ""guarantee"" is softer than I believe, and compensation isn't completely decoupled from productivity.  
* There are other incentive structures that I am not aware of in place to maintain productivity.  
* The US government is competent at administering tens of millions of workers, and the bureaucracy involved in administering jobs guarantee workers grows sufficiently sublinearly with the number of workers. The resource wastage is otherwise significantly smaller than I currently believe.  
* A jobs guarantee program has other benefits over a UBI besides being less expensive and providing the government with a reliable source of labour.

CMV: Museums and other places of historical significance should be funded no matter the profit they make,1829,189,2018-05-13 19:51:30,"Was having a little debate with my friends about this. They don't really care about monuments and museums and said that if they didn't generate any tourism/money then they would be fine with knocking them down \(mentioned Stonehenge specifically\). Even places such as Buckingham palace they would be fine with destroying if they didn't generate money.

I obviously didn't agree with this, although it seems to be quite a popular opinion. I thought that regardless of their profit they are culturally significant \- can you imagine a UK without castles or Stonehenge? It's our identity.

Edit: Just to clarify I'll rewrite the statement here \-

**Places of proven historical or cultural significance should be funded if they can't make a profit.**

I can't keep replying guys! Too much. Feel like most of the comments are to me not clarifying enough.

* **I don't think that we should keep all museums running, only the ones that can be proven to hold significance in some way.**
* **This is a hypothetical situation \- many places break even or even make a profit nowadays.**

CMV: Movie rating sites such as Rotten Tomato and IMDb are useless and don’t accurately represent the quality of a movie.,1830,196,2018-12-23 20:41:59,"These movie rating sites do not understand the main point of movies which is entertainment. Giving movies a sub 60% but having audience ratings above 90% show the uselessness that these websites represent. I don’t go to a movie to see whether or not it deserves a high rating. I go to a movie to enjoy myself and get away from it all. 

Also, the more I talk to people the less they seem to use these websites because they don’t care about their ratings. They nearly always rate action and sci-fi movies horribly and just rate movies that correlate to some issue in society highly. Do I think Get Out was worthy of a 98%? No. But since it has something that people can relate to, they rate it highly. 

Maybe I am missing something about the necessity of these sites for the movie industry, but nonetheless, change my view. ",1

CMV: Apple with Tim Cook is a terribly run company and if Steve Jobs was still around to see what it has become he would be disgusted.,1822,264,2019-09-13 03:49:02,"Back when Apple was starting out the company had so much vision and risk with products like the Apple II, Macintosh, Lisa etc.. after Steve Jobs got fired from Apple during his short tenure at next he witnessed the company he built turn into a faceless corporation with inferior and boring products like the apple newton, power Macs, basically as much crap as Apple could stick their brand on it thry sold it.

After the CEO at the time got fired and was eventually replaced by Steve Jobs, we saw Apple begin to get rid of all the suits in the company who were trying to whore the apple brand, the brand discounted basically 90% of their product lineup and then Steve showed us products like the iMac G3 (translucent coloured computer), iPods, Macbook, the IPad and IPhone.

After Steve Jobs death in 2011 with the final product being the IPhone 5S and being replaced with Tim Cook we have seen little to no innovation with only annual small updates to the iPhone, the Iwatch, and only maybe two other notable devices both of which have already been released by various other companies.

I think in regards to apples tight run anti-consumer third party repair and their lack of any totally innovative we see the company again that was run again by suits and cared more about profit than innovation and in the next 10 years we will see Apple drop to what BlackBerry and Nokia are now, companies afraid to see the future.

Update: I have changed my mind on the Subject for anyone who see this but thought i would still clarify a few things that people have been commenting.

1) I in no way dislike Tim Cook I think hes a great guy and his recent donation to the Notre Dame cathedral proves how much more generous he is over Steve as well i dont think Steve Jobs was perfect i think he was incredibly flawed and a colossal dick to both his staff and his family with such examples as him belittling his employees to disowning his own daughter. I just think its pretty damn impressive of him to bring a company from basically on the verge of bankruptcy to profit and streamlined all of apples devices not many CEOs can do that.  

2) The iwatch is a great device and is a very popular smartwatch my point was that it was late to the game. Devices such as the Sony Ericsson LiveView debuted in 2010 and Samsung gear in 2013 while the iwatch was 2015. This was both a Jobs and Cook issue but in honesty if they were just taking their time and spent the time developing it i think it was worth it and from various commentators and seeing them in person their not too bad.

3) Apple has always been and most likely will continue to be Anti third party repair/consumer friendly fixing even an Iphone 8 broken screen requires you to basically get it fixed at apple if the touch sensor is broken i have done my fair share of repairs on iphone 7s and newer and their terrible as well macbooks, ipads, and iwatches but this is becoming not only an issue with apple but other manufactures such as Samsung and Huawei as well so another view changed. 

So in general yes i believe apple to be a still successful company and only struggling as much as basically every other manufacturer at the moment since basically phones now are capable of doing so much that very little upgrading will be neccesary and eventually EVERYONE will feel this but with Apples wealth like Nintendo they have can have years ahead of them of lost profits and slumping sales and still stay afloat. I have always been a fan of Apple especially the story of two guys who made a company from a small garage in Palo Alto to one of the most recognizable companies on the planet just with steve jobs depature i felt as though Tim Cook a relatively unknown apple employee taking the ranks of CEO was going to destroy apple and send them to the likes of various other companies that have changed CEOs and feel hard but with comments claiming record profits and still R&D on the horizon i feel relieved that will see more of them down the road.",1

"CMV: The political terms ""left"" and ""right"" are vaguely defined and almost meaningless. We'd all be better off not using them.",1819,332,2019-05-07 06:20:26,"This post was inspired by a recent news story. 

Over the past few days, there has been some controversy over how to describe Louis Farrakhan. After he was banned by Facebook, a number of news outlets referred to him as far-right. A number of conservative outlets objected that he has much stronger ties to the Democratic party. Now, there is debate over what to call him. [Here's](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/louis-farrakhans-brand-of-black-conservatism.html) an article which argues that he should be considered right wing. [Here's](https://www.dailywire.com/news/46712/wapo-hank-berrien) an article which argues that he belongs to the left. 

I'd like to propose a third position. Left and right are stupid terms. We shouldn't be wasting time trying to categorize people like this. The left/right schism is simply tribalism. 

**My argument**

**1. The terms are meaningless**

There is no agreed upon definition of these terms. If you ask 100 people to define these words, you will get 100 answers. They are so vaguely defined as to be almost meaningless. 

Also, the terms fall apart if someone takes unconventional stances. What do you call a socially conservative socialist? What about an anti-war capitalist? 

The left/right schism also stops making sense if you leave your country. For example, is China left wing or right wing? The government calls itself communist and supports a high degree of intervention in the economy. These characteristics are typically considered left wing. Then again, they're also militaristic and anti lgbt. These characteristics are typically considered right wing. So, where do they fit on the left/right spectrum? What about Russia? What about Iran? 

Further, the definitions shift over time. When I was a kid, ""left"" and ""right"" were defined differently than they are now. If you go back in time further than 100 years, the political alliances are almost unrecognizable. White supremacists supported government intervention in the economy. Capitalist were the anti-authoritarians who railed against the conservative monarchists. 

The terms ""left"" and ""right"" are messy. There is no consistent philosophy which underlies them, and they serve no purpose. The attempt to place everyone into these categories is a giant waste of time. 

**2. The terms are harmful**

Worse, these terms encourage tribalism. Too many people support ""their team"" unconditionally, and are unequivocally opposed to anything which they associate with the ""other team"". Instead of evaluating issues rationally, people get caught up in an imaginary war with the rival tribe. 

A lot of people develop stereotypes in their head, place the most reprehensible people on the other team, and then generalize that person's characteristics to everyone else perceived as belonging to that team. The Democrats don't support Stalin, and the Republicans don't support Hitler. But, left/right thinking encourages people to make those associations. How much animus and bickering could we avoid if people didn't engage in this type of tribalistic thinking?  

**Closing thoughts**

In reality, few of us fit neatly into one of these categories. We're all susceptible to tribalism sometimes. But ultimately, we all have our own unique perspective. We have varying opinions, and we try our best to think logically. The left/right schism doesn't reflect the variety of ideas and perspectives which exist. 

These terms are overly simplistic and derail political dialogue. There is no consistent definition, and attempting to categorize people this way is a waste of brain cells.",1
"CMV: Incoming migration in relatively healthy economies is almost always beneficial, produces jobs and helps growth. In the long run, migration is economically desirable.",1817,461,2018-11-22 04:55:27,"I've studied International Relations for a while and I've gotten familiarized with history, geopolitics, economics and the like. It's not hard to encounter evidence of migration being beneficial for economies that are growing, but it's also not hard to encounter people who oppose migration on a moral/ethic basis or on personal opinion. Most of the time they misrepresent migration phenomena (they think Latin-American migration to the U.S. is increasing or they think their countries are migrant destinations instead of transit countries) or do not understand what migrants are like in each specific phenomenon (i.e. Mexican migrants are drug dealers; muslim migrants are terrorists; Japanese migrants are spies; Jewish migrants are tax evaders and so on and so forth)

I have a wealth of evidence that migration is beneficial for economies. I'm looking for evidence to counter what I already have at hand because I want to learn and because I'm not comfortable without evidence against what I learned. And so I make this post in order to look for good sources proving cases where migration has had negative impacts in a country's economy.

There are only four catches:

* If its your opinion, I don't care. If I was changing your view I would give you numbers, not what I think

* If the information comes from something as biased as Breitbart I will not consider it at all. Doctored reports exists on both sides; if I was changing your view I would give you quality sources even when I know *The Independent* would provide ""evidence"" supporting my stance

* The information must be pertaining to countries that are relatively economically stable. I will not consider crippled economies getting more crippled as a basis to say migration harms economies. Of course, this does not mean I will only consider perfectly healthy, 100% economies, it just means that if the country had a crisis before a mass migration I will not consider migration as the cause of a crash.

* I'd like to focus on economy. I know that socio-cultural problems have been born from migration historically, and I can find plenty of evidence of this myself. This is why I'm focusing on the economic effects of migration rather than the social ones. Please consider this I'm doing this as part of a discipline towards research and investigation, not because I'm trying to qualify migration as good or bad.

Other than that anything goes. History, papers, articles, opinions from professionals that can back their stance up, testimonies from people who had access to information (like governors and presidents of the past), books, you name it. 

**Edit**:

This thread is overwhelming. From the get go I have to say that this community is amazing because I've yet to find a single person who was aggressive, bigoted or xenophobic in the discussion when I expected a shit storm. The amount of information here is just massive and it is comprised of well-researched sources, personal experience from privileged points of view (like people who has employed migrants or foreigners a lot and can testify about their experience with them), well-founded opinions and perspectives from across the world.

I only think it is fair to the amount of people who have been dedicated enough to post well-rounded responses that I declare all the multiple ways in which my view changed:

* It was hard to prove that migration does not aid in the long run, but it was easier to prove that it seriously stresses the lower-income population in the short and medium term. If you want to look for that evidence it is enough to browse the multiple replies.

* Migration to welfare-states poses different challenges: countries that wholeheartedly admit migration have a more serious budget stress that may not be sustainable.

* Migration has tougher effects i the micro level that in the macro level. Sure, the economy might develop but a few affected communities can have a tougher time.

* It is hard to quantify exactly how much migrants take out or put in in the short run; the evidence I have is that they supply much more than they take in the long run, but some posters were able to show higher impacts in the short run.

CMV: Measurements by weight in recipes are superior to measurements by volume in recipes,1814,242,2019-05-19 23:06:04,"I frequently search for recipes online, and find it annoying that the vast majority of recipes I find use measurements in cups rather than measurements in grams or ounces. I can think of no good reason that measurements in cups are still so common beyond a stubborn reluctance to adopt a clearly superior system. If I understood a practical reason why people insist on volume measurements I might find the whole business less irritating. My reasons are:

* Kitchen scales are cheap and easily available, and are not substantially more expensive than a full set of measuring cups.
* They are considerably more precise than volume measurements, as 1) cups can vary considerably in volume, from near 200ml to as high as 250ml (edit - see [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cup_\(unit\)) wikipedia page for an outline of different systems with differing volumes), and 2) equivalent weights of ingredients often do not occupy the same volume, e.g. packed vs unpacked flour (edit - or differently chopped fruit, veg, etc.).
* Linked to the above, recipes using weight will be more consistent in their results, and closer to what was intended by the recipe's author.
* There is less washing up associated with measuring by weight - all measurements can be done by adding directly to the mixing bowl, with no need of numerous additional containers.

Exceptions to this:

* Measurement of oil-based liquids, where there is not a neat 1g:1ml ratio may be better to measure by volume, especially as these are often directly added to hot pans so would be difficult to weigh.
* Very small quantities, less than 1tsp, are likely better measured with an appropriately sized measurement spoon due to the limits of precision in cheap kitchen scales.

Arguments that will not change my view:

* ""Scales are still more expensive than cups"" - the cost of scales is under £10, and as such is comparable to most basic kitchen equipment, such as pots and pans.
* ""People are used to volume measurements, and manage fine with them"" - acknowledgement of this is why my view is ""measurement by weight is superior"" rather than ""all recipes should use weight measurements""

What would change my view:

* A significant advantage of volume measurements that I am unaware of.
* Evidence that my perceptions of the advantages of weight measurement are not accurate.
* Evidence that the cost of kitchen scales is an insurmountable obstacle for a large enough number of people that it would be unfair to ask them to convert from weight to volume measurements (i.e. the majority of people).

Edit: Most new comments seem to be rehashing the same points as older ones. The general consensus seems to be:

* Weighing is more precise. Agreed
* Precision isn't always that important. Also agreed
* Volume is more convenient. Disagree - as best as I can tell my disagreement on this one is due to a combination of differences in common container sizes for flour, etc. in the UK vs the US, and differences in relative levels of practice with different methods of measurement.
* Cheap scales are bad at very small quantities. Agreed

I'm unlikely to reply to anything further unless it's significantly different from these points.",1
"CMV: I don't like Apple products, because I think closed systems facilitate anti-consumer practices",1807,207,2018-08-19 21:28:19,"I don't necessarily have a problem with specific Apple products. Yes, there are many arguments based on the price, [planned obsolescence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AvND-RH79o) , certain hardware/software flaws, etc. But most of these problems are either present in the products of other companies, or are a result of what I consider to be the more fundamental problem of Apple: The closed-system philosophy. This manifests itself in two aspects: closed ecosystem (both on hardware and software levels), closed and predetermined user experience (again, both on hardware and software levels). By the second one, I mean, even considering its own capabilities, Apple restricts users on purpose and artificially (Following the ""less is more"" belief).

My mind can be changed on two issues: 1- I might not be knowledgeable enough about the data and especially the extent of Apple closedness when compared to its competitors; 2- Closed-systems are not bad by themselves, and they do not necessarily lead to anti-consumer practices.

"CMV: the clock in a soccer game should be stopped for stoppages, rather than adding stoppage time.",1802,345,2019-03-17 18:27:32,"I was having a sports-related discussion with my brother in law earlier today and we stumbled on this topic.  Neither of us are big soccer fans, but we both like sports in general. We both watch football (which has its own flaws) and baseball (which also has its flaws). I later found this article:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fancy-stats/wp/2014/06/12/stoppage-time-in-soccer-how-it-works-and-what-it-means/?noredirect=on

I still don’t understand why a referee in charge of timing can’t just stop the clock for things like injuries, goals, and such. My reasoning:

* Other timed sports have this mechanism. The clock stops in American football for various events. The clock stops in hockey for fouls and goals. The clock stops in basketball for fouls (and I believe after baskets later in the game, in some formats). 
* The clock not stopping and leaving it to the referee to determine stoppage length leads to time-wasting that is against the spirit of competition, even if it is not technically against the rules - think of the instances of a player knocking the ball away from an opponent about to throw the ball in, or continuing to dribble the ball away from opponents when it is not their possession. These tactics, along with the prevalence of flopping, IMO, are detrimental to gaining new fans, especially in America.
* Knowing exactly when a game (or period of play) ends is better than the referee deciding it in any semi-arbitrary manner. The article I linked mentions that referees are unlikely to blow the play dead in the middle of an attack. I think that this is bad practice. The clock runs out on American football teams in the middle of a drive all the time. Basketball players are forced to take an unlikely shot because the clock is running out and the ref isn’t going to let them just play out the whole possession after the clock hits zero.
* If guidelines and best practices exist as to when to add stoppage time, including stoppage time during stoppage time, why can’t rules exist regarding stopping the clock? Discretion is a dangerous thing, especially when being influenced by a home crowd. 

CMV, folks. I like sports. I’d like to appreciate soccer more, even if I don’t go out of my way to watch games outside the World Cup,

Edit: I’ve heard the argument about stoppages leading to commercials. I don’t buy that. Soccer stoppages aren’t generally long enough to squeeze in ads. There aren’t timeouts, the (terrible) concept of a TV timeout doesn’t exist like it does in basketball games, you’re not gonna cut away during a penalty kick (where the clock runs), and injuries suck but I don’t see any loss of value if you replace footage of a guy on the turf getting stretchered off with a commercial or two.",1
CMV: Killing animals for pleasure is wrong,1804,1499,2019-11-25 22:16:27,"Hi all!

I've recently been thinking a lot about the subject of ethics and how they apply to the treatment of animals in the modern day and age (especially in the food/meat/dairy industry, obviously). I've come to the conclusion that I could get rid of animal products in my diet and go totally vegan without any health risks, so the only thing that is still making me consume meat is the taste of it. I also believe that due to how supply & demand works, I am paying for the animals to be killed.

And this is where this CMV kicks off, I believe that it is wrong to kill animals just for the sensory pleasure. The main reason why I think so is probably empathy and the fact that they are sentient in at least a similar way that we are. If there was overwhelming evidence to conclude with certainty that animals are basically like robots, are incapable of any psychology whatsoever, then I guess I would change my mind.

"CMV:If Russia's goal in interfering with the 2016 election was to ""undermine public faith in the US democratic process"" then they have already succeeded.",1801,216,2017-07-16 20:29:15,"The released intelligence report states -
 ""[We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US

While the secondary goal may have been a preference for a Trump presidency, it makes one question why this would be the case. Russia is no fool, and I believe that they understood a Trump presidency would garner just the results that we see now...a wildly unpopular president, at least with both the media and congress, and a much more divided nation. I don't think that anyone could disagree that half of the country that actually cares lost their minds when Trump won. We've seen unprecedented levels of [vitriolic rhetoric](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-women-madonna-idUSKBN15704A) in regards to his presidency, [unprecedented levels of negative media coverage](https://shorensteincenter.org/news-coverage-donald-trumps-first-100-days/), and [even an attempt to assassinate republicans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/multiple-people-injured-after-shooting-in-alexandria/2017/06/14/0289c768-50f6-11e7-be25-3a519335381c_story.html?utm_term=.229ab6be40c2) 

Trumps presidency has been overshadowed by scandalous allegations since he was elected, and six months into his term, [articles of impeachment have already been introduced](http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-rep-brad-sherman-just-introduced-1499883664-htmlstory.html).

Now, much of negative coverage has been of Trump's own doing, but at the same time, I believe that the media focus on scandal is far outweighing and serious reporting on policy, and the Russian's knew that electing a divisive figure like Trump, with no political experience, would lead to exactly what we are seeing play out, a scandal ridden news cycle with nothing but negativity and division.

So long as the media continues to focus on scandals and allegations rather than policy and results, and the congress continues to devote resources to investigations rather than legislation, then Russia has succeeded undermining our electoral processes by disrupting the focus of both the american people and the congress by focusing attention away from policy.

"CMV: It should not matter if being gay is a choice or the way someone is born. The choice of whom to love is a personal one and, as such, should be respected.",1793,305,2019-02-28 11:32:42,"I find that the political correct consensus is to assume that some people are born gay. And, therefore, they should not be forced to change. While I see in this an important step towards the acceptance of homosexuality, I also see it as a quite limiting view. In a sense, it equates sexual preference to a “condition” that some people have

On the other hand, I feel that the idea of assuming that some people choose to be gay is almost universally condemned.

The way I see it, it really should not matter. However two (or more) consenting adults decide to explore their sexuality is a matter that concern them, and them only. Either by choice, or by genes, there is absolutely nothing wrong about it.",1
CMV: Federal Law should require that people the age of 60 or higher take a road test every five or so years.,1790,344,2018-12-20 15:17:31,"Might just be me ranting here, but as a driver it's just always seemed so ridiculous to me that the elderly are allowed to drive on the road incorrectly and people just say ""Oh they are old."" It's not safe. Things like this being allowed are accidents waiting to happen.

  


I understand that as you age your cognitive and physical abilities worsen, but that isn't an excuse for being a threat to other people's safety on the road. I think once you reach the age of 60 you should be required to retake a driving test at the least. And this should be required every five years thereafter. (Am open to other people's opinions on those numbers or other possible methods of testing the elderlys ability to drive as well).",1
CMV: Not investing in educational capital (to the extent of other nations) is one of the greatest national security threats to the US during our generation.,1792,90,2017-10-16 01:10:44,"As we have seen, wars have continually been fought with heightened technology - tactical decisions are made with counterintelligence gathered with the most advanced tools developed. WWIII will not be fought in the streets, it will consist of drones, utility/infrastructure cyber attacks, and immense propaganda/misinformation.

By not placing an emphasis on STEM education in public schools, we are placing the next generation of US citizens in danger of falling behind academically and defensively. I believe this because the way war is waged has drastically changed and to remain one of the bastions of democratic security, we need to treat the funding of education as a security threat.

"CMV : Wood is not the reasonable, sustainable answer to disposable plastics",1788,206,2019-10-29 23:21:14,"We are clearly going through a revolution in regards to disposable items such as straws and plastic silverware. In our search for a more sustainable material, we are leaning towards items such as paper cups (typically lined with a heat resistant or water proof coating which isn't recyclable or biodegradable), recycled paper towels (which are no longer recyclable themselves, only compostable, due to the tiny nature of their fibers and their likelihood of clogging up recycling machines) and wood-fiber items.

My question I guess is, wouldn't the speed with which we go through items like disposable utensils, cups and serviceware put a strain on our environment and it's resources and in fact be LESS sustainable than using and recycling plastic? The wood and paper fibers used in these items have to come from somewhere and countries like China are already putting a huge strain on the environment, cutting down over 25 million mature trees each year just to produce those single-use chopsticks that get tossed after one use.",1
CMV: you have no moral obligation to disclose the fact that a meal is vegan to people eating it,1782,1120,2019-04-10 04:41:58,"For the context of this thread, I read https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/baydpv/wibta_if_i_throw_my_nonvegan_sister_a_vegan_baby/ and I was shocked to see that I disagreed with every single upvoted answer.

First off, I'm not vegan, or even vegetarian. I eat meat regularly, and I really don't have a vegan agenda. I think we should eat less meat in general for ecological purposes, but that's about it.

In this thread, people seem to really dislike the fact that the OP (/u/queenvegan) wasn't disclosing to her sister that the food was vegan. This seems absurd to me: every food is vegan *by default* until you add meat or dairy products. Something ""being vegan"" is not a particular diet, it's just a default state of food until you add some specific ingredients.

So, why should people have to ""disclose"" that a meal is vegan? When I'm making pizza, I don't ""disclose"" the fact that they don't contain carrots, that's just absurd.

People in this thread also say that people might be allergic to the ingredients of the vegan food. But a non-vegan meal doesn't necessarily contain less allergens than a vegan meal, since any non-vegan meal is just a vegan meal + meat/dairy. Also, would they have asked OP to disclose the fact that the meals contain meat? This seems like a double standard to me. Vegan food covers a lot more diets (vegetarians, vegans, halal, kosher, ...) than non-vegan food, yet somehow vegan food requires a disclaimer while non-vegan food doesn't?

More generally, it just seems absurd to me that someone would complain that a specific ingredient they like isn't present in the food they get served for free at a party they're not hosting. The OP even made an effort to find a vegan equivalent to pulled pork!

It seems to me that the reasons why those answers are upvoted isn't because OP is an asshole, but because commenters feel *entitled* to having meat in every single of their meals, which is both unhealthy and ecologically questionable. Please change my mind.

CMV: Tik Tok is the most toxic popular social media platform currently used,1778,331,2020-07-03 06:41:35,"EDIT: I find it interesting that so many people are saying things like “welL MY algorithm works fine for me” or “well you are on the wrong side of tik tok” without disputing that the “side of tik tok” im on is incredibly toxic. What you are essentially saying is “#notalltiktok” just like not all men or not all cops. The argument here is there is a toxic side to tik tok and the toxicity on that side is more toxic than other social media platforms. ALSO before one more person says it, I dont dislike the content I see. I can enjoy the content but also be aware that it has negative psychosocial effects on myself and others. 

So I'll start of by saying this, I downloaded TikTok expecting haha funny videos like Vine but was bombarded by the ""algorithm"" showing me gorgeous people either showing off how gorgeous they are or how rich they are or on the other side, complaining about how ugly they are and how they will be single forever, with the occasional funny video sprinkled throughout. 

A quick scroll through will show like I said, people (mostly Gen Zers) scantily clad chasing internet ""clout"" perpetuating unrealistic body standards. Obviously I don't think these people are purposely trying to perpetuate unrealistic body standards, but with the algorithm that pushes popular videos to your feed based on what you like, you are way more likely to see the gorgeous people with a million likes than the average person with average likes, basically telling you, the average person, that in order to have worth in this world, you have to be gorgeous and not have clothes on. Some TikTokers have called this out by posting shirtless videos and clothed videos simultaneously with the same content and noting how many more likes the shirtless video got, but continue to post shirtless for the clout. These people preach body positivity all day, but when a normal looking person makes a video that maybe isn't edited the best, the comments border on bullying whereas when a pretty person does the same the comments are ""wow so quirky!""

Next, mental health has become a plot device for clout. There is a distinct difference between reducing the stigma of mental health issues and using it in a video to get likes. I saw a video recently where a girl who was objectively pretty was saying how ugly and annoying she was and how mentally unhealthy she was in a comedic way with over 2 million likes. Now, Im in no way saying she doesn't struggle with mental illness, but it seems like these creators are realizing that things like mental illness will ""resonate"" with viewers just to get likes which devalues it and reduces the ability to open up meaningful dialogue about mental health. 

Now I know these issues are not EXCLUSIVE to TikTok, people have been chasing clout on Insta and Facebook for years, but I think the introduction of a video-only site where people are pretty much encouraged to be racy for likes and where a computer algorithm decides who sees what makes TikTok incredibly toxic and damaging especially for teens and young adults.",1
"CMV: In RPGs, being evil should be easier than being good.",1782,472,2019-03-20 12:38:01,"EDIT: By ""good"" I really mean ""heroic"". In video games, ""good"" is generally understood to mean ""Luke Skywalker"" and ""evil"" is understood to mean ""Darth Vader"". People who pay their taxes and drive under the speed limit are good people, but they aren't who I'm talking about here.

&#x200B;

And I don't mean ""easier"" as in you get a bit more cash or a sweet gun by playing a bad guy. I mean there should be major, meta-level reasons to entice players to be evil and dissuade them from being good.

In a lot of video games with morality systems, there's usually no meaningful difference between playing as a good person and playing as a bad person. I say ""meaningful"" because while some dialogue may be different and you may get different benefits, the problem lies in the balance.

It's my belief that the root of evil is selfishness and the root of good is self*less*ness. If Kim Jong Un could lead the lifestyle he leads today *without* keeping his people effectively in slavery, wouldn't he? Probably; only especially depraved psychopaths would choose to make people suffer if there was no benefit to themself.

People who we think of as heroes do the opposite as Kim; they make personal sacrifices to help others, and the greater that sacrifice is, the more heroic they are. This is the approach I think games with morality systems should take.

Consider the first Bioshock. In it, you have a moral choice to kill kids in order to gain more powers (adam), or set them free. This WOULD be a moral dilemma...if you didn't get rewarded with the same amount of adam a little bit afterwards for setting them free. The only actual dilemma going on is if you want the adam right then or to get a lump sum of it shortly thereafter. It's a great game otherwise.

Consider Mass Effect. It's another great game, but it handles being good and evil in the opposite way that it should. Ultimately, to keep all your squadmates and get the best endings, you have to make the good choices. Meaning, being good is the *easy* route that gets you the best rewards. Sure being evil gets you more money, but in that series, money really isn't important and there's plenty of non-evil ways to make money anyway, so it's ultimately a non-factor as far as benefits go.

Now consider Vampyr. It's not a *great* game, but it handled the morality system almost perfectly, in my opinion. First, there are no ""good"" or ""evil"" dialogue options. Second, there is no difficulty setting. Why? Because the difficulty of the game is determined by how strong you make your character. How do you make your character stronger? By killing people and drinking their blood, of course. In this game, there's a number of locations in London that have characters in them, and you can kill and feed off of all of them to gain more vampire powers. So if the game gets too hard, you can just kill some people to get more powerful than the enemies you have to fight. It's a simple solution, and it's undoubtedly evil. A player who genuinely wants to be good person is therefore forced to play on the game's hardest difficulty, AND has to keep people from dying on their own (you play as a doctor in the plague-ridden Victorian era of England). It's pretty challenging and completely unnecessary to your goal in the story, but then that's what being a hero is all about, isn't it?

I did say the game's morality was *almost* perfect, though. While the beginning of the game is very challenging as a good guy, the last half is still rather easy. Even though you can get way stronger by being evil and get more cool vampire powers, it still becomes a cakewalk by the end and being good gets you the ""best"" ending.

While Vampyr didn't truly exemplify a meta moral dilemma between good and evil, its concept of it was dead-on, in my opinion.",1
CMV: The USA is still suffering from the lingering effects of McCarthyism,1781,551,2019-05-25 22:19:03,"This is coming from an outsider's perspective, but I don't think that necessarily makes my view less relevant. Anyway, onwards...

The seemingly pathological fear of ""The Red Menace"" in the US is holding it back from progress. This is a developed nation in which the sentiment of ""Can I afford to be ill?"" is not uncommon, where you could go into debt for having the audacity to need emergency care which you couldn't have foreseen (There's the joke that Breaking Bad could happen *only* in America, because affording treatment anywhere else in the West is easy). Any attempt to reduce the costs are pejoratively labelled ""Socialist"" and seen as anti-capitalist (I don't think it necessarily is, since healthy workers are inevitably better workers). Just because it inevitably requires tax increase doesn't always make something Socialist, and, even so, just because something is Socialist doesn't make it a bad idea. The fact that the Affordable Healthcare Act was named that (despite that, from the outside, it not being all that affordable) and ""Affordable"" healthcare wasn't generally seen as pretty sensible, is crazy.

The amount of debt students leave university with, is so large grand gestures are made to pay off their loans. Although the UK also has sizeable debt, it isn't held against your credit rating, issuing and repayment are means tested, and is wiped after 30 years, so isn't really comparable. The idea that someone could be denied education because they don't know if they can afford it seems completely unjust.

One response may be that this is just rhetoric, but the rhetoric clearly works, meaning it isn't just the political class, but a national culture of seeing anything offering equality of *opportunity* as evil lefty insidiousness. Americans love the idea of freedom, it's the \#1 export, but it doesn't look like a very free nation where people can be trapped in poverty due to the cost of bettering themselves, or fluke of illness. The fact that in the UK, no matter how little you earn, you know you can be seen by a GP, or get a degree appears like vastly greater freedom to me.

Edit: I would also add I think the USA's Overton window is still reduced as a result or McCarthyism.

Edit, the sequal: Alright guys and gals, I think I'm done here. Thanks for your time!",1
CMV: I think drinking until blacking-out is an asshole think to do,1780,241,2019-08-20 01:46:00,"I think that drinking until blacking-out in any public place or in any instance where you can affect a third person is an asshole thing to do, for example, i recently read a post where OP had trouble with his GF drinking beyond her capabilities and ended up like a bag of potatoes that OP had to take care off, any reply saying that she should not drink until blacking you received negative feed back and i do not know why

Is it really ""i was drunk"" ""i can't remember"" a valid excuse to any mishaps?

I also think that even if nothing bad happens, drinking that much is not a good thing to do because drinker exposes the group or the people around them to a bit of danger and that exposure alone is a bad thing to put anyone thru it.

Can someone then tell my why is it really a ""bad view""? Should anyone be able to drink what ever they want even if it makes the people around them uncomfortable?  Is there a limit where it is acceptable?

EDIT: I am not considered alcoholics here.. that is a different question

EDIT 2: I should not treat this as a black or white situation, i still think going beyond your limit is bad but there are definitely more to look into each individual situation

EDIT 3: It seems you could be functional while blacked out so probably i should have written that drinking until becoming sick/needy/problematic is an asshole thing to do

EDIT 4: I agree that honest mistakes can happen and everyone should have a few ""get free of jail"" cards because you do not always know your limits, but after a few anyone should get used to it and not knowing your limits is not longer an excuse",1
"CMV: Copyright should be reduced to 28 years, works should be archived upon registration, and fair use should be extended.",1778,350,2019-07-29 19:08:19,"The way artists create new works is by making derivatives of older works. With copyright being 70 years after death it takes far to long for artists to create remixes. If someone can't recuperate the costs for making a work before 28 years is over that is their fault and they are to blame. 

Fair use should be extended to include fan works, especially non-profit ones. One man made a remake of a metroid game that looked really good. Nintendo took it down, probably because it contested their remake. This is an instance where copyright went against its purpose of  incentivizing new works and actively stomped on it.

When someone registers a work the government should archive the work so that it can later be released to the public domain. This is especially important for works under always online drm(which should not exist but I'm not arguing that now) that wont function when the servers go offline.

I am arguing for reform rather than abolition because artists both deserve to be payed for their efforts and they will be less willing to create works without some reward, some do anyway though.

The only reason I accept copyright even with it being a total abomination is that we live under a shitty capitalistic society where nonsense like this is currently necessary.",1
CMV: ‘The Future is Female’ movement should r really be ‘The Future is Equal.’,1777,1163,2017-12-05 23:29:03,"According to Merriam-Webster, the definition of feminism is “The theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes.”  So since the principle of feminism is based on equality, why should the future be only female?

CMV: Trans people often lack direction and center their identity around their gender/trans status,1772,267,2019-04-28 20:12:35,"I've been trying to better understand motivations behind transitioning but am hung up on one point. As an lgbt person, I really want to understand so please help me reddit! My thoughts about this are still pretty jumbled so feel free to ask for clarification about anything I don't explain well.

My main hangup is that it seems like trans people have taken on their gender or trans status as a huge focus point of their lives. I've never met a trans person who before transition was a lawyer or successful business owner with lots of interesting hobbies. Instead it seems more often than not to be someone who lacks direction and finds community with other trans people and purpose in the transition process. While I think people should be free to identify however they choose, I can't help but think someone must be a pretty boring person if their gender or trans status is one of their most interesting and defining qualities.

I often see this in the gay community too. I've seen so many ladies take their sexuality on as their entire identity. After coming out, they cut their hair, wear rainbow stuff, buy flannel with the goal of looking more gay.  If you asked me to describe myself in a handful of words then I would say that I'm a scientist, triathlete, animal lover, math wiz,  disorganized person, a great friend. I might add that I value being a good partner to my wife but the fact that my wife and I both have lady bits isn't one of my defining aspects. I genuinely feel that if I woke up tomorrow as a man then that would not be ideal but not a big enough issue that I'd put all that energy into transitioning. I don't see how I could transition while also dedicating myself to my career and hobbies to the extent I currently do and those things are way more important to me than my gender.

To summarize: I want to better understand transitioning but am stuck on this idea that to transition, someone must be centering their identity around their gender or trans status. That leads me view people who are transitioning as boring or lacking hobbies and purpose. It also makes me think we shouldn't encourage young people to transition. During teenage & college years, people are still figuring out who they are and sometimes temporarily latch onto ideas, find religion, etc while figuring out what they want out of life.

&#x200B;

Edit: I should clarify that what I've said only would imply to someone currently transitioning. If someone transitioned in the past then what I've said here would apply at the time of their transition and would say nothing about who they now are.",1
"CMV: Most posts to CMV are a bid to be heard, not a request to ""change my view""",1771,173,2014-12-17 06:59:03,"I think we ache to be heard, and CMV is a devil's bargain: in exchange for fulfilling the need to be heard, we offer our mind up to be operated on by language.

Changing one's view is actually a somewhat painful process--learning new information is hard, feeling empathy for someone else is exhausting, admitting to a wrong or incomplete view is discouraging, and opening one's ideas to vulnerable cross examination is frightening.

What most of us actually want (and need) is to be heard in the complete sense--to know that someone else understands the context and specifics of our suffering (whether great or small). We yearn to ""feel felt"" by someone. Having one's mind changed in the process is simply the associated cost of venturing out to have this need met.

**Note:** I created /r/ihearyou as an experiment along these lines.

CMV: Django and Dr. King Shultz should have just tried to buy Django’s wife directly instead of attempting the whole Mandingo business.,1767,130,2018-12-28 03:56:52,"(Warning: spoilers for the movie Django Unchained) 

I absolutely love Tarantino’s Django. But I consider it a pretty big plot hole, or at the least very poor reasoning on the part of Dr Schultz, to insist that they couldn’t simply offer to buy Broomhilda from Calvin Candie. The idea that Calvin wouldn’t sell her because she simply isn’t important enough to bother selling, doesn’t really hold water with me. This idea to offer to buy a Mandingo instead was extremely dangerous, would have been very hard to pull off, and seems totally unnecessary. It obviously led to some very serious consequences. 

I get that Calvin wouldn’t have been interested in selling her for normal market value, especially if he knew that it was to reunite her with her husband. But the fact that she spoke German would have been enough of a pretext for Dr. Schultz to show up and offer maybe double or triple her market value, simply for her German. Candie probably has a man that is in charge of buying and selling slaves, and Dr Schultz would have just needed to approach this man. I think this would have been an easy and practical solution, but maybe I am missing something. CMV?",1
"CMV: If white people being scared of black people on the street is racist, then women being scared of men on the street is sexist.",1775,1136,2014-05-30 16:22:48,"I was just reading [this](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/30/an-open-letter-to-all-my-male-friends?CMP=fb_gu) article and was again reminded of an analogy I have heard a few times before that seems to me correct. If it is the case that it is racist for a white person to be afraid of a black person walking toward them, then it is sexist for a woman to be afraid of a man walking toward her. I have heard this analogy a few times but have yet to hear any good reasons for there being a morally relevant difference between the two cases - if one is wrong, so is the other. 

To be clear, my view is **not** that women being afraid of men on the street **is** sexist or wrong. My view is slightly more subtle; it is that there is no morally relevant difference between a women being afraid of men on the street and a white person being afraid of a black person on the street. If one is wrong, so is the other.

"I remain unconvinced that my death has a fixed 100% probability, CMV.",1772,922,2013-05-04 04:52:27,"[Context](http://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/1dlowm/an_intps_list_of_goals/c9rka6x)

Despite the overwhelming evidence that all human life so far has been subject to mortality, I *still* remain skeptical it's impossible to achieve immortality. There are already effectively 'immortal' lifeforms existing on Earth (eg. certain jellyfish, plants, lobsters)— why couldn't clever scientists eventually transpose the benefits to human life?",1
CMV: It's perfectly acceptable to be uninterested in someone because they're in a wheelchair and something like that should be disclosed before the first date.,1770,453,2018-12-12 00:54:03,"I listen to Todd and Jayde in the Morning when I drive in to work and they do a segment called ""Blown Off"".  It's a segment where two people went out on a date, one person thought it went great, but they never hear from the other person again.  The first person will call into the show, the show will call the second person, then explain the situation without disclosing that the first person is on the line too.  

If you read the title then you probably know exactly where this is going.

Madison called in and thought she had a great date with Travis.  They met on a dating site.  Politics are important to her, she brought up her views immediately, and they were totally in sync with his.  Madison felt the date went great and wants to see Travis again.  They've emailed political stuff back and forth since then but he doesn't respond to her phone calls about a second date.

So, Todd and Jayde get Travis on the phone and he confesses that he doesn't want to date someone in a wheelchair and feels she should have been up front with it.  Todd, Jayde, and Madison mostly call him a superficial asshole for the rest of the segment. 

You can [listen to the call here](http://www.plj.com/blownoff/).

Now, for me personally, being in a wheel chair is not an automatic dealbreaker but IMO it's perfectly acceptable for Travis to not be interested in Madison because of it.  It would likely be a drastic change in lifestyle for him and one he may not be that interested in changing.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Being concerned about medical bills, the ability to have sex, etc. are all valid reasons not to be interested in someone.

Furthermore, being in a wheelchair is kind of a big deal and Madison almost certainly knew that which is why it wasn't on her online profile nor did she mention it.  Neglecting to mention that is, IMO, akin to lying and that right there may give him concern about going forward in the relationship.  She went into the date springing it on him and should have been up front with it.

I understand that defining health is a complex issue and it's not as easy saying ""that person has some extra lbs, therefore they aren't healthy"" but the fat acceptance movement's sheltering of obesity normalizes poor health. Obesity is a serious problem and the fat acceptance movement allows us to bypass facing the obesity epidemic as a society. There are major systematic changes that we, as a society, need to address in order to have a healthier populous, and accepting that obesity is okay or promoting it is a barrier to the hard work of changing the way our culture treats food, diet, and exercise. 
People deserve respect, but part of that respect should include real discussions about weight and finding better ways to support people.

Edit: To illustrate a few examples of the trends I've seen and point out the difference between the intent of the movement and the byproduct(s) of it- (I'm on mobilize so I apologize for formatting)

There are a number of fativits who write about how being fat is good, I've interpreted that as promoting fatness/obesity.
Examples:

[Glorifying Obesity](http://www.fatgirlflow.com/glorifying-obesity/)

You can find [Fat is Fabulous](https://www.tumblr.com/search/fat%20is%20fabulous) posts all over Tumblr and other social media sites. 


I think the difference here is the original intent of the movement. I see that the intent of the movement is to end discrimination against fat people, but I think many individuals use that as a scapegoat to normalize obesity. Cathy Young wrote a succinct article that reflects my thoughts that may be a better descriptor - [Pro Fat An Unhealthy Status Quo](https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2013/12/30/fat-acceptance-hazardous-health/1ojfoW46R2elWpHLarA19M/story.html)

EDIT 2: POST CMV -
A number of people have illustrated the difference between the fat acceptance movement and the fat *people* acceptance movement, which is the key differentiator for me. Yes, there are radicals (as in any movement) who take the message further to say that obesity (the illness) is healthy, which is not true. But as I understand, the moderates of the fat acceptance movement simply aim to normalize the existence of obese people in an effort to make their lives less hellacious. There are a lot of people who are hung up on the normalizing aspect of this thread and who have pointed out that of course the movement aims to normalize obesity. I posted this thread with a common understanding that obesity, the illness, is bad, and should not be upheld, glorified, promoted, etc... That said, I understand there are differentiating interpretations on the word ""normalizing"". I see the point that normalizing doesn't always equate to condoning, as in, we should normalize mental health issues, but that does not mean we glorify mental health problems. Thus, I think my real issue here has been associating the movement and it's intent with radicals. I would, therefore, appreciate links to resources that are upstanding representations of moderate thinkers of the fat acceptance movement. Thanks to everyone for your input, thought provoking conversation and for changing my view! ",1
CMV: UI design is and has been moving in the wrong direction since the rise in popularity of Apple devices.,1763,115,2018-09-24 23:35:27,"Apple built their modern product lines around a few simple ideas. Make the products attractive, make the hardware high quality, and make it easy to use.

Since the iPhone and other apple products have gained a ton of popularity, I've noticed a trend in UI design for websites, apps, phones, games, everything, and that's to make things SIMPLE. The problem is that life is not simple, and products are being designed TOO simply to the point where they lose utility.

The most recent example of this that prompted this post was Facebook. I wanted to make a simple status about a concert I'm going to next week. I made the post, clicked tag an event, searched the concert... Except instead of giving me every result for that search, or giving me an option to see other options or really anything that could possibly have been useful, Facebook picked the top 10 related events within 5 days of the current date, and refused to show me anything else. Maybe it's different on the desktop site, but on the app there is literally no option whatsoever to expand your search.

Just yesterday I was making an Instagram post. Some pictures were landscape, some we're portrait. On Instagram you can only see the crop size for the first picture of an album for... no discernable reason. When you select multiple photos, it just resizes all the rest of them according to how the first one is sized, and you're just strictly not allowed to change them.

I could list examples all day, but the trend in UI design is no longer how FUNCTIONAL can we make our products, it's how can we guess what people want so as not to confuse them with options. What happened to just putting ""more options"" or the three dots or three lines indicating a menu for people who wanted more options?

Obviously this being tied to Apple is more just my idea and speculation, but the trend is what bothers me. I feel in the pursuit of making everything user friendly, we are making products do less and be less functional for no reason and in ways that could easily just be crammed into an options menu while still maintaining a modern and streamlined design. The new trend is to just straight up remove functionality from products which I think makes them harder to use.",1
CMV: We (the United States) should focus less on Mexican illegal immigration and more on fixing Mexico.,1753,642,2018-10-08 23:42:21,"While I do understand that there are several problems that are caused by illegal immigration such as drug crime, human trafficking, and lower wages in particular vocations. It is also true that the majority of people from Mexico flee to America for the betterment of themselves and their families. Mexico has failed their people and they just want to live in a more just and free society. If I were Mexican and lived in the same desperation I would absolutely do what I had to do to get to America. 

What I propose is working with the Mexican government to end the corruption and drug trade by any means possible. Make it a safe place to live, work and raise a family. I believe we can accomplish this by forging an alliance with Mexico and utilize our armed forces to target and eliminate the cartels. Once they are gone, assist the government, with the help of our FBI and CIA to flush out the corrupt government officials. 

My belief is that doing this not only would we strengthen Mexico and allow it to reach it's full potential. We could also put a huge dent in the cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine problem in the U.S. as well as in Canada. 

I have been to Mexico several times, the landscape, culture and people are truly fantastic. In my view there is no reason why we shouldn't do what we can to help our neighbors to the South while also benefitting the U.S. and Canada as well.

"CMV: in most cases, cultural appropriation is a nonissue",1754,645,2018-05-01 21:25:40,"I’ve seen a lot of outrage about cultural appropriation lately in response to things like white people with dreadlocks, a girl wearing a Chinese dress to prom, white people converting to Islam, etc. we’ve all seen it pop up in one form or the other. Personally, I’m fairly left leaning, and think I’m generally progressive, so am I missing something here?

It seems that in a lot of these instances, it’s not cultural appropriation at all. For example, the recent outrage about the girl’s Chinese prom dress. She got blasted for cultural appropriation and being racist. I really have no idea how there’s anything wrong with somebody wearing or appreciating a piece of clothing, style, art, music, or whatever from another culture. I like listening to hip hop, that doesn’t mean I’m appropriating hip hop or black culture. It just means I like the music.

So what’s the deal with cultural appropriation? I get where it can be an issue if somebody is claiming that a certain ethnic or cultural group started a particular piece of culture, but otherwise it seems like a nonissue and something that people on my side of the political spectrum just want to be mad about.",1
CMV: drinking only to get drunk is perfectly acceptable,1753,255,2020-01-05 13:52:00,"By drink here I mean consume alcoholic beverages 


The only time I drink is to get drunk. I don’t have a drink with any meals during the week or have a beer here or there. When I start drinking my intention is to get drunk, but not to the point of memory loss or sickness. 

I read a comment along the lines of “if you only binge drink you don’t have a healthy relationship with alcohol” and I think that’s ridiculous (unless it’s so excessive it causes memory loss or sickness). What’s the difference between spacing drinks throughout the week versus having them all in a short amount of time? 


Can anyone explain their opposing view?


edit. Like someone else mentioned, I don’t get the “it’s for taste thing.” I can say with some certainty no one is born liking the taste of alcohol and the only reason you become used to the taste or desire it is because you desire the feeling of intoxication. But again, CMV",1
CMV: Politicians should not be judged by the character of their Supporters,1745,314,2020-01-24 00:02:29,"I hear a lot of criticism of politicians based on the supposed character of their supporters. Andrew Yang gets [questioned](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/04/14/yang-white-nationalists-town-hall-sot-vpx.cnn) because some white nationalists support his candidacy and a [lot](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/04/andrew-yang-4chan-alt-right/) of [articles](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/9/18256622/andrew-yang-2020-president-meme-yanggang) mention the support he gets on places like 4chan. Bernie Sanders supporters are widely stereotyped as cultish, fanatical misogynistic “[Bernie Bros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Bro)”. Going back to 2008, I remember Clinton and Obama supporters accusing each other of being misogynistic and racist, respectively.

I don’t think this is helpful. A candidate is not responsible for their supporters, they are responsible for their own actions and the actions of their surrogates and subordinates only. Put another way, the problem with Donald Trump is not that David Duke supports him, but that the president supports David Duke (or at least the racist ideas that white nationalists espouse).

Finally I think criticizing candidates based on the character of their supporters is specifically unhelpful. In Andrew Yangs's case, white nationalists might support universal basic income (UBI) because they think it will help poor white people. However, this is beside the point. We should be asking if UBI is a good idea. Would it actually help poor white people? What about black people, women, rural people, or urban dwellers? What would its impact on the economy be? Talking about a candidate’s supporters distracts from what the candidate is actually advocating for.

One caveat to this is that it seems fair to criticize a candidate as being more or less electable based on the cohort of their supporters. It is valid to argue that Biden is good general election candidate due to his high level of support in Midwestern states. It would be fair to argue that Sanders' support among young people wouldn’t translate into electoral college wins, as turnout among Millennials and Gen Z is too low. I'm not sure if either statement is true, but they are at least worth considering.

Disclaimer: I probably come across as a angry Andrew Yang supporter.  I actually don’t  particularly support the guy. I'm uncertain whether UBI would be helpful, in part because it hasn’t been tried on a large scale.

Edit: based on the first comment I think I didn't make my argument clear.  If a candidate is supporting racism and sexism or inciting violence against minorities, they bear responsibility for encouraging hatred and violence. And they have blood on their hands. But if the candidate is not encouraging hatred and they are not allowing their surrogates to do so, they are not responsible if some of their supporters are hateful people. Our focus should be on what the candidate herself/himself is saying and doing.

Edit 2: [/u/arcosapphire/](https://www.reddit.com/u/arcosapphire/) and [/u/lost\_in\_light](https://www.reddit.com/u/lost_in_light) make the point that candidates supporters can recognize things about a candidate that we don't either because a candidate doesn’t publicize their position or because they employ dog whistle rhetoric. If a candidate receives the support of a particular group of people we should endeavor to find out why. It will likey tell us something about the candidate that might not be publicized in their platform.",1
"CMV: Working hard doesn’t actually pay off in the workplace. Instead, you get more work, stress, and responsibility while mediocre or sub par employees reap the benefits.",1751,279,2019-07-08 03:28:10,"I genuinely want my view changed, but my work experience has made me question if working hard is actually benefitting me.


I consider myself a very hard worker. Specifically, I am very efficient, reliable, and productive.  I have worked several office jobs now where I was quickly promoted, and given more responsibilities based on my work ethic.  At times I’ve received small raises and bonuses, but nothing significant.  I feel I’m doing two to three times the amount of work as a colleague, but we are in the same role and being paid almost the same amount.  Additionally because they have consistently demonstrated that they are less reliable, the expectation of them is quite low and they are given easier tasks or less tasks, while I pick up the slack.  


A few years ago I found myself in a position where I valued a stress free environment over money.  I took a part time, low paying job that I felt I could excel in but not feel burnt out.  Three years later, I am the owner’s right hand, working full time and carrying out way more responsibilities than anyone at the company and things that are typically outside of my job description because I’m “the only one that can be trusted to do a good job.”


I feel that working hard and being responsible has led to a cycle of getting more work piled on, while others get to sit back and let me take on all the stress.  The expectations of me are much higher, bc I’ve set a precedent that seems impossible to back out of.  


I’m often left with two thoughts - 1. Why should I work so hard, show up on time, etc if I could essentially do half as much and be given the same pay and job security?  2. How do I get out of this perpetual cycle of showing my good work ethic without being taken advantage of and becoming resentful? It seems as if mediocrity would serve me better in the long run.  


I realize that it’s good to take pride in your work and feel good about doing an honest job - but that’s not keeping my spirits up.  I think companies are greedy and as soon as you prove your reliability and willingness to go above and beyond, they jump on the opportunity to pile on the work and squeeze as much out of you as they possibly can.  


I don’t want to be a subpar employee or bitter and resentful.  Please CMV!",1
"CMV: Drive-in through coffee should be served at a temperature where, if you immediately take a drink, you will not burn your tongue.",1755,356,2018-03-21 00:05:39,"Let me clarify that I am only talking about drive-through. If you are sitting in the restaurant and want to take your time and carefully slurp the very top layer off as it cools, I understand that.

I also understand that some people don't want to drink their coffee while driving, but prefer to take it to work or whatever destination.

But what about people who want to drink it on the road? When I get up at 4am and have a 2.5-hour drive, and I want coffee, it bothers me when it is served at a temperature too hot to drink. It has a lid and an insulated cup, so it takes a very long time to cool. I'm tired and want my coffee. I can't take the lid off, or it will spill. I frankly can't even safely test the temperature, because roads aren't perfectly smooth and an attempt to take a small sip can be ruined by even a tiny bump.

Those who want to drink only at their destination have more options. They can bring a coffee-maker to work, or carry a thermos and pour the coffee into it for better insulation.

Those who want to drink on the road have no other option but to wait, with the lid on, scared to take a sip. It's unconscionable ;)

EDIT:

A couple of counters to common replies:

1) Serving temperature and brewing temperature are not the same! 

Here is a micro-roastery guide on optimal brewing temperature, (which by the way is *not* boiling) which goes into more depth:

https://blackbearcoffee.com/resources/87

Here is a medical paper on the ideal coffee temperature to avoid burns, publishe din the medical journal ""Burns"" in 2008:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18226454

According to this article, the ideal serving temperature, which was determined using both data about risk of burns and the subjective taste and experience preference of 300 subjects, was 136 degrees. However, the average serving temperature at restaurants is between 165 and 180 degrees.

2) Ice is not a good solution! I am working on a longer writeup for this point, including calculations of heat transfer, but lunch is being served. I'll try to work on it ASAP. ....Update:  I am too lazy to do math. But aside from still providing an inexact time over which the temperature changes, my other issue here is there's no reason to think this will lower it to the proper amount, without lowering the temperature too much. It may still be too hot or too cold.

3) Let me add more emphasis to a small part of this: It's not just that I want my coffee to be ""generally a bit cooler."" There are lots of solutions to that. I want it to basically be as hot as possible without actually causing burns at a biological level. If it is hot enough to make me pull back or say ""whoa that's hot it's fine. If it's hot enough to kill the top layer of skin cells on my tongue, it's not. Outside of people who actually like being burned, the only reason to serve it *above* the temperature that causes burn seems to be if you want to carry it and drink it later, which I addressed in the first part of the question. 

A concept I've had to go into a few times is ""drinkable window."" We all have a range of temperatures where we find coffee drinkable. There's some subjectiveness here, of course, but I argue that most people don't actually drink coffee when it would burn them. They wait until it cools, sipping off the top until it gets there. If we take the temperature at which they actually start taking full sips instead of tentative slurps, and measure how long it takes for that temperature to reach the ""too cold"" area, that time remains the same regardless of how hot the coffee initially was. It doesn't have a memory of how how it was a few minutes ago. 

So the total drinkable window of the coffee is unchanged by the starting temperature, only by your personal preference of how wide that range is. The only reason to serve it hotter than the high end of that preference is if you're planning to store it for a bit before drinking, which I think is a small number of cases. I think it is more reasonable, and safer, for them to put the hot coffee into an insulated container while parked, than for me to try and sip scalding coffee while I drive to test whether it is safe to drink. And if I just let it sit for an extended ""safe"" period of time, I have missed out on a lot of that ""drinkable window.""

4) I've invested a lot of time into this, as it is a slow day at work. I still should not have, as I have a long list of things to do. From this point on I will probably only respond to things that are original or that are easy to reply to. Thanks for a fun conversation, everyone! I hope others who agree with me will carry on the debate with more vigour as I step back a bit.

5) I think a redditor has just changed my life! https://www.joulies.com/products/5-pack

I'll find you and guild you soon, but I'm trying to finish my inbox, and I've neglected a bit of work I have to do before 5, sorry man. Bother me if I don't get to it tonight.

5.5 oops I still ahven't guilded him

6) According to a Redditor, Dutch Bros Coffee not only offers this already, but even uses the term ""drinkable.""

CMV: There are no extra ethical obligations for white parents who adopt children of color.,1750,139,2019-08-16 04:39:11,"This may be a bit of a niche issue. i was recently told that it was justifiable for parents seeking to adopt children to prefer children of their own race, because there is an increased burden (specifically in the context of white parents adopting black children) to provide a child of color with role models and peers of that color. The justification for this view was in part that only people of color could effectively speak to a child of color about experiencing racism, and secondly that culturally, the child of color should be exposed to (but not forced into), their associated culture.

This strikes me as backwards for several reasons. 
This view promotes systemic racism in adoption. White parents are statistically in better positions to adopt children than black parents are, but under this view, black children are potentially denied opportunities to be adopted because the view promotes arbitrary and illusory difficulties associated with raising them. To me, the overwhelming benefits of having a stable family would outweigh any of the problems that might result from white parents adopting a black child, but I do not think these are real problems to begin with. 

Culturally, it seems problematic to me to suggest that just because a child has a certain skin color and ancestry they should be exposed to the culture associated with that skin color and ancestry. this isn't to say that african american culture, or any other culture in america is invalid. only that it's okay if a black kid grows up without getting exposure to american african american culture from their parents. And even if this is a legitimate concern, the internet basically ensures that every child today can have exposure to any culture that interests them. 

The only problem that i think comes the closest to being legitimate is that it may be difficult for a white parent to speak with authority on issues of experiencing racism. But, i have two solutions for white parents: they can research the issue, and relay advice from people of color on the issue to their child. Good advice is good advice, even if it is relayed through a pair of white people. Or they can focus on teaching their child how to learn for themselves, which is something they should do anyways. Then the child can learn from voices of color on their own, or in tandem with the parent. Neither method i think requires anything the parent shouldn't already be doing for their child. 

The person who espoused these views is someone i have immense respect for, but we just could not come to an agreement one way or the other in the short time of our discussion. So I'm interested in seeing what the people of this wonderful subreddit have to say, and changing my view if it makes sense.",1
"CMV: The Superhero genre is really just centered around spectacle and the creative exploration of superpowers, but there is no real depth to it in general.",1742,397,2018-04-23 13:32:57,"WARNING: There is a spoiler for the Marvel film Civil War ahead.

The writer Brandon Sanderson once said, ""What your magic *can't* do is more interesting than what it *can* do.""

When I heard this phrase it really made me appreciate how true that is. Soon after I watched the Marvel movie Civil War, and realized that basically, all superheroes are mary sues, and they all have equal ""power levels"". While watching it, I got the sense that they were all just made of Invincibilium, and the fighting didn't mean anything. Nobody was going to be permanently injured, much less killed. When they are killed, it's always built up and has an obvious subversion of the rules of the ""universe"" up until that point. When Don Cheadle's character was crippled by falling from the sky I almost laughed out loud. Here we have a movie full of high-powered superheroes fighting each other, and yet the only significant injury is from a guy falling and hitting the ground. It's pretty absurd, really.

So why I think this shows that the films aren't meant for a post-juvenile audience is that, when you're a kid, all you care about is how awesome the superheroes are. You don't want them to have weaknesses. But once you reach a certain age, things change. In movie reviews for other genres you'll often read the critic espousing what a well-rounded and human character so-and-so is, and that almost always involves their flaws as well as their strengths. Because we understand that this is what an interesting character is.

The heroes' journey almost always involves a person who is mediocre, weak, or somehow not as good as they could be. The story is about them growing, improving, maturing, whatever - and eventually coming out a better, stronger person on the other side. Superheroes don't really follow this arc. Often they start off normal or whatever, but then they just skip straight to becoming powerful and never stop.

I've noticed this in the ""Arrowverse"" tv shows also. Very often a plot will revolve around a superhero either killing or not killing, and the *internal struggle* of this. I think this is often a point in the story because once you have a mary sue superhero who is unkillable, the drama can only come by them choosing to utilize their power to its full extent, or not. To me, this is very boring. It's kind of like taking something immature and trying to contrive it into something more mature. Like Vincent Adultman on Bojack Horseman. ^^Okay, ^^that ^^was ^^a ^^bit ^^of ^^a ^^stretch

I've heard people say try to defend the superhero genre but I feel like this is kind of indefensible. I mean, don't get me wrong, I think superhero movies speak to a very real part of us all, the part that thinks people with superpowers are fucking *awesome*, which they are, but that's only because you don't care about the things that end up being more important in fiction. We just love the spectacle of it.

Strangely, I think the only really potentially interesting characters in the superhero genre are **villains**. They are vulnerable, obviously - they're always defeated by the superheroes - and the potential is always there for a compelling and humanistic backstory.  The Batman series does this well, probably some others too. However, I think there aren't enough interesting villains like this to vindicate the genre as a whole, as often it's acceptable to just have the villains be fairly one-dimensional.

EDIT: This has gotten a lot of attention so I guess I'll address a couple quick things.

I acknowledge that characters can change over time despite being invulnerable.

The Dark Knight and Watchmen are two good examples of superhero movies that subvert many tropes of the genre, true. I'm a fan of both. In Batman in particular though, I think the villains are equally as interesting as the hero, if not more so. And Watchmen is a unique spin on the superhero genre, almost more like an indictment of it than a part of it.

Another moment I remember from when I was younger that opened my eyes about superheroes is this speech from the film [Angus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgIv6KoJw_A). Superman is not brave - Superman is invulnerable.

CMV: Circumcision should be banned in infants and children unless there is a medical issue,1739,1016,2018-02-27 08:32:22,"I myself was circumcised. Most women I talked to about it prefer circumcised guys. But that does not necessarily change my view that I wish I never had one. 

The foreskin has a purpose. For one it has more nerve endings then any other part of the skin on the penis. Snipping it off will reduce sexual pleasure, it also keeps the glands moist and sensitive. When snipped the glands always exposed and takes a more rough and dry appearance and also this is another way it reduces sensitivity

Also when having sex, It often takes a minute or two to get it in, this is an unnecessary waste of time, which also sort of ruins the moment that would not be needed if I had a foreskin which acts as a lubricant allowing it to slide in with ease rather then inserting a bare gland that is also dried out. 

Despite the fact it decreases risk of infection and some STDS, I do not think it is worth the cost which is essentially reducing sexual pleasure. I will never know how it feels to have a true orgasm the way it was supposed to feel. 

Many guys who get circumcised as adults report a major decrease in pleasure/sensations. Some saying it went from a 10/10 to a 2/10. For those of us who were cut at birth, we have nothing to compare it to and because we enjoy sex or fapping its easy to say ""It works, its fine"" but really this is one dimensional thinking and we do not know what we are missing out

Some say they did not get reduced pleasure but I think that is because some have a hard time admitting it, they paid into it and did something they can not take back. The nerves to not lie and most nerves in the skin are in the foreskin. The most sensitive part of my penis is what little skin there is left. Its where 80% of all the sensitivity is. I could only imagine how much im missing out on since most of the skin there is gone. 

But apparently because its more hygienic and reduces risk of infection, someone else decided I do not need that foreskin. Made the decision against my will and consent. It should be banned

CMV: In 40 years people will think of superhero movies the way we think of westerns from the 60s/70s today,1737,158,2017-11-11 01:57:18,"They just seem so generic and formulaic to me. Even watching some of the better-rated ones from this year (Wonder Woman, Spiderman), it just feels like they aren't offering anything new, and all follow the same formula like all the Western movies did. Maybe 2-3 of them will stand the test of time (e.g. The Good the Bad and the Ugly, Fistfull of Dollars, Dark Knight, etc.), but the vast majority will be largely forgotten.

Obviously, it's really hard to predict what media from today will ""stand the test of time"" and be celebrated 40-50 years from now. I'm curious to hear what everyone thinks about this, but right now I believe the big superhero movies will be largely forgotten once the trend passes.

CMV: Mormonism is Jesus Christ fan-fiction.,1732,895,2018-05-05 09:26:28,"I'll admit that I am not that knowledgeable about the history of Mormonism, so I am open to my mind being changed. That said....

Mormonism, when compared to other popular sects of Christianity, is relatively young and a ""New World"" religion. It has no direct lineage to any other form of mainstream Christianity due to the nature of its founding. It draws inspiration from the Bible and creates an alternative history and timeline of events in the same way a fan might draw inspiration from a popular work of fiction and create new scenarios for the characters. 

Mormonism, despite being based on the teachings for Christ, is not a Christian in the traditional sense of the religion, similar to how Muslims are not considered Christian, even though they believe in Jesus Christ and regard him as a central figure in the foundation of Islam. Mormonism has its own prophets, and as previously mentioned, the history of Christianity under Mormonism ""deviates"" completely from the Biblical Cannon.  

This is not say anything bad about Mormons. I harbor no ill-will towards the religion and I mean no offense. I do not mean to belittle the religion so I apologize in advance if my tone comes off as confrontational. I do not mean to imply that there is anything wrong about Mormonism, or that other sects of Christianity are by any means ""correct."" I have no skin in the game, so...

CMV!


:Edit:

Wow. I never thought this question would get this much traction. I have posted CMVs before and they never really got much attention, so I am a little overwhelmed by the response. 

I wish I could respond to everyone who took the time to respond. I must admit that I didn't put too much thought into my post before making it. I was literally standing at my refrigerator looking for something to eat and the idea ""Mormonism is Jesus Christ Fan-fiction"" popped into my head and I wrote out my initial impressions to the idea. 

I have since had my mind changed multiple times and will post the arguments below. I appreciate all the feedback and I realize that this is a controversial issue, so the respect that I have seen (I haven't gone through the whole thread) is very impressive for the internet. The arguments are repeating themselves, and I have already changed my mind, but I am still open new viewpoints and frankly, I find the discussion fascinating. I'm glad the question was well received and hope no one was offended by my comments.

I've gotten responses from Mormons, Ex-Mormons, Roman Catholics, edgy atheists and probably one or two bots. For me: **""All Christian Religions are Fan-Fiction""** is the argument that won me over since Jesus Christ himself did not establish a Church (good job Edgy Atheists!). It was his followers who wrote the books of ""the New Testament."" I also must acknowledge the fact that from a Mormon perspective, Mormonism is the one, true religion with the *closest* links to the teachings of Christ. I'm not saying I believe that to be true, but in their narrative, Christ does have a direct link to the New World and belongs under the umbrella of Christianity. 

There are lot of great counter arguments presented against the above, but I am not necessarily here to determine what is ""correct"" so much as I wanted my mind changed on that specific statement. What is spiritually ""right or wrong"" is subjective to me, and I avoid judging other people's faith....well, I guess I few all faith as the same. 

Ultimately, I think it doesn't matter what you believe, as long as you are a good person and treat others with the kindness and respect Christ talked about. I do not consider myself a Christian (or ""religious"" in the traditional sense) but I do think if we all tried to be a little bit more like Christ, we could fix a lot of the world's problems. 

Thanks CMV!

"I believe its insensitive to expect the poor to ""pick themselves up by the bootstraps"" CMV",1739,2218,2014-02-09 22:40:17,"(First post here, sorry if it breaks any rules or is incoherant).

My father refuses to give money to beggers and usually drives away muttering something along the lines of ""He should just get a job,"" ""They're probably lazy drunks."" ""Just sign up for welfare."" etc.

To me, this attitude is so condescending and ignorant of the begger's situation. The person might've just hit a rough patch in life, they might be too occupied with familial issues, maybe they have a mental illness making it hard to get a job. 

There are plenty of reasons for why that person can be poor, and it doesn't help them at all if we yell and hound them to ""just get a job"". It is inconsiderate to expect them to just help themselves, and it would be much kinder to give them spare change if they beg for it. CMV.

"CMV: in order to solve anything, we need to solve poverty first.",1730,254,2020-10-02 05:09:53,"Basically, when you're unsure if you sleep with your stomach full and your schedule is basically wake up-commute-work-commute-sleep, you can't care about anything else, you can't think about the environment, you can't think about the struggles and disadvantages of other groups of people, you can't think about other social problems. Yes, the government can work on these issues, but it's easier to get it done when the majority of the population cares about them, at least in democratic countries. Environmentalists, progressists and other social activists have a harder time getting these poor people to vote for them, either because these people are really conservative and religious, or because these groups have very little charisma in comparison to the conservative populists. Yes, the people affected by environmental destruction, discrimination and other social problems can be affected by poverty too; but the majority isn't. If these people no longer have to worry about starvation/security/eviction, then these people fighting against these social problems can have at least a few more supporters and will have a slightly easier time with their goals.

P.S.: Damn! This post exploded when I was sleeping.

P.S.2: I was talking about social and environmental problems, not math problems.",1
"CMV: There should be no separate minimum wage for waiters or ""tipped"" employees. And tipping should not be a social ""expectation"" in pretty much every dining situation & other places where tips are ""expected"" as a given. Waiters & others should get paid a fair market wage by employers.",1727,474,2018-05-29 19:49:10,"I don't think it's good or right to have a lower than regular minimum wage for any profession. There should just be one minimum wage in each city, regardless of job.

I think that waiters, hairdressers, valets, and other professions who have a tipping expectation should just be paid a fair market wage paid by their employers and there should be no pressure or expectation of tips from pretty much every customer.

Some tips would come every so often from customers who feel that service was particularly awesome and who will want to reward that amazing service with a tip.

As it is now, I think it's wrong toward the employee to pay them less than minimum wage before tips are factored in.

And I think it's currently wrong toward the customer to make the customer feel pressured to leave tips for just basic service that should really be part of the food or the haircut you paid for. After all, even as it is now, if I paid for food, that food should be available to me to eat it, and if I paid for a haircut, someone should be cutting my hair, yet all kinds of tipping expectations are thrown around on top of these things just for me basically getting those things that I paid for. So, take away separate minimum wage, increase the prices a little bit to provide employees a fair market wage for the job, and be done with it.

And every once in a while, when someone goes above and beyond, I can tip them, because I feel like doing it, not because of a societal pressure to do it for no reason.

The current system creates unnecessary stress and discomfort.

CMV: Senior citizens (65+) should be required to retake the driving test periodically,1714,313,2019-08-15 11:28:29,"The title basically says it all. I don’t have an exact number as to how frequently they should have to retake the test (maybe once every 2 years?), but I think something needs to be done. I don’t remember the exact statistic, but I remember seeing a sign in the DMV that said something along the lines of “a teen texting and driving has the same reaction time as an 80 year old.” That’s crazy. You’re telling me that an 80 year old has the same/similar reaction time as someone who’s not even looking at the road half the time?? The teen can put the phone away but an 80 year old can’t stop being old. These people took the driving test so long ago, it’s surprising to me this isn’t already a law. Cars have changed a lot since the 50’s, as has the amount of people on the roads. Also, some of these elderly folks could be suffering from some sort of degenerative disease that could greatly affect their response time and overall competency level. In my personal experience, individuals with dementia or Alzheimer’s are typically unaware or in denial of their condition, and will continue to drive despite obviously lacking the skills to do so safely and effectively. Requiring them to retake the exam periodically would likely result in fewer accidents, as well as ensure their safety.",1

If there is a claim being made, I want to be able to access the original study that made the claim, see how they came t that conclusion, and assess the validity of their findings.

Did they account for the right controls and confounding factors? 

How big was their group size per condition?

What other tests did they use to strengthen their results?

"CMV: As an American, I shouldn't be obligated to participate in the national anthem as a display to prove my allegiance to my country.",1719,411,2018-06-01 15:46:55,"If you asked the average American how they feel about participating in the national anthem, I think your average person would say that they couldn't be bothered by it. All you do is stand when they ask you stand, take off your hat, place your hand over your heart, face the flag, and to keep doing it for another minute and a half.

Why? What exactly does our national anthem symbolize? ""Well it symbolizes freedom,"" some say. At the same time others will tell you that by participating in the anthem you are paying tribute to our troops, or to those who lost their lives defending our flag and its values. Some will say it's a culmination of the two and then a couple other things. And then there are the people who have no idea to what the hell the anthem is supposed to mean, and stand there out of mere social compliance. The last scenario is particularly concerning, because not only are there people blindly pledging their allegiance to ideals they're oblivious to, but some people do it simply to avoid being ostracized by the more radically patriotic members of our society. I find this particularly irritating.

The first issue, which I've already touched upon, is not everyone can definitively agree on what or what not the anthem represents. I'd argue that often times the anthem is a projection of an individual's own subjective opinion of what they believe it represents. Not every American looks through the same lens. Some people love America because of its opportunities, others for its values, its ideologies, its culture\-\-the list goes on. The fact that we all have our own reasons to why we love or even hate America means that standing \(or kneeling\) for the national anthem is going to bear different levels of significance for different people.

The second issue, which is the more important issue at hand, is that refusing to participate in the national anthem is seen as abhorrent, unpatriotic behavior. Some people go as far as saying that by not participating in the national anthem that you somehow hate America. Really? You're telling me that by not going through the mundane motions of the same old song\-and\-dance that I've done a thousand times, that I hate my own country? Maybe you could argue that I'm not a true patriot in the traditional sense, and probably that's true, but I'd argue that my right to choose whether or not I wish to participate in the anthem is the epitome of American values.

Whenever you think about America, the term 'freedom' probably comes to the forefront, but for me that isn't always the case. Often I feel our social and cultural atmosphere dictates a vast amount of our behaviors in ways we are unaware of, and in some cases\-\-like the one I'm trying to highlight\-\-can impede on our individual liberties. I shouldn't be harassed just because I don't want to participate in what feels like an out\-dated, almost cult\-like tradition. As a child going through primary school, it always seemed odd to me that I had to pledge my allegiance to a piece of fabric every single morning before class could even begin. It wasn't until around middle school that I had finally decided I was no longer going to participate in the strange ritual. I remember the first time a teacher of mine noticed me protesting the pledge. She stopped the entire class just to scold me and try to force me to participate. When I refused, I was immediately punished and given detention. The idea that I was being punished for not participating in the obsessive utterance of these words was ludicrous to me even as a twelve\-year\-old. In spite of this, my contentious behavior on the matter continued throughout my high school years, and along the entire way I was met with friction by my teachers enforcing me to participate. Now this behavior was admittedly partially due to my rebellious disposition at the time, but mostly the idea that I had to align myself to a certain set of values and then pledge my so\-called allegiance to said values felt inherently wrong to me.

Now this begs the question: Is there such a thing as 'forced\-patriotism', and does it inhibit our individual liberties? I think it does, but not it ways that are obvious. This idea of patriotism is imposed on us at such an early age, that we become indoctrinated into this artificial ideal, where we often go through the motions without truly thinking about why we do them. Now I'm not saying that if you participate in the national anthem to show your patriotism that you're some brain\-washed drone blindly adhering to an out\-dated tradition. If the national anthem has meaning to you, and participating in it brings you joy, then by all means do it \(Insert Shia LaBeouf here\). But don't insist that I adhere to an idea that I don't believe in, as that is the most un\-American thing you could do to a person.",1
"CMV: Donald Trump is going to plunge our country, and the world, into ruin.",1712,1022,2016-11-09 19:18:33,"It is a very dark day for America, as well as the rest of the world. While I don't really care about Roe v. Wade or gay marriage, although I do support both of them, the fact remains that climate change efforts and affordable healthcare are going out the window.

In addition, the reason the U.S. Is so successful is because it had European allies. We've lost those, and now it is us, Russia, and China against the world. Nuclear war is very much possible. And don't forget, our Vice President-elect is a young earth creationist! We can say goodbye to science education!

So, yes, I think that Donald Trump's election is going to be the beginning of the end in the stability of the world. I WANT my view to be changed.

CMV: I see no reason why men's and women's chess are separate events.,1709,651,2014-06-22 21:34:58,"Sure, sex segregation makes a lot of sense for many sports/games where men might have an advantage due to physiological differences.

But chess is purely mental. There is no need for strength, speed, endurance or any other physiological parameter that would give men an advantage.

In fact, some women do compete successfully in top flight tournaments with men, something that would be impossible in physical sports.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judit_Polg%C3%A1r

If anything, it seems that ""women only"" chess events are sexist, because the implication is that women are not as smart as men.

Edit:

The totality of several posts convinced me that women only events maybe needed *for now* as a kind of a remedial measure for countering many years of men dominance in chess and the fact that currently women are underrepresented in chess.

However, I still believe that an *eventual* goal should be complete sex equality in chess tournaments.",1
CMV: Bernie Sanders supporters who are voting for Trump over Hillary are either behaving irrationally or should not have supported Sanders in the first place.,1707,1141,2016-05-08 10:11:12,"There is no legitimate reason for a Sanders voter to vote for Trump over Hillary.  Hillary and Sanders are far more ideologically similar than Trump and Sanders.  Hillary and Sanders voted on the same side in the Senate on bills 93% of the time.  To put that in perspective, Hillary voted the same as Republicans less than 40% of the time.  On virtually every single issue Hillary is closer to Sanders than Trump.

Hillary is untrustworthy and has a record of unprincipled flip-flopping, granted.  But, you would have to be delusional to believe that Donald Trump is any more honest.  He lies compulsively.  He said the unemployment rate is somewhere between 28-40%, that blacks kill 81% of white homicide victims, which is wildly inaccurate, that John Oliver begged him to be on his show when John Oliver has never talked to him, that he (Trump) was virulently opposed to the Iraq war before the war started, that Ted Cruz's dad associated with Lee Harvey Oswald, along with a million other lies.

Not to mention Trump himself is either lying about his actual positions, or, he is one of the stupidest people to ever become the nominee for a major party.  Possibly the most important issue we face in the near future is global warming.  Trump said that:

""""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.""

In my mind that is the single dumbest, most worrying, and all around buffoonish statement I've ever seen of someone running for President.

And for those who call Hillary a hawk, Trump wants to send 20-30k troops into Syria to fight ISIS and start capturing and torturing the wives and children of suspected terrorists.  

The only legitimate reason for a Sanders supporter to vote for Trump is they never really shared Sanders' ideals in the first place

CMV: This statement by Nadal on gender pay gap makes perfect sense,1709,464,2018-06-10 19:44:23,"So the following conversation is being ascribed to Rafael Nadal as a part of some interview.

*Q: “In tennis, should women earn as much as men?”*

*Nadal: “It’s a comparison we shouldn’t even make. Female models earn more than male models and nobody says anything. Why? Because they have a larger following. In tennis too, who gathers a larger audience earns more”.*

This is an English translation of a statement printed in an Italian language magazine for an interview that probably happened in Spanish, so it's quite possible his actual statement was not the same.

To me, this statement makes perfect sense. If Maria Sharapova or Serena Williams attract more viewers (or are able to sell more expensive tickets) than Andy Murray, they should get more money \- no question about it. To me it seems like feminists want to push for equality in places where they are at a disadvantage, but want to do nothing about situations where they are at an advantage, are likely to be paid more, or are more likely to be hired in the first place (models, porn stars, massage therapists, hospitality industry jobs, and so on).

But some feminists I follow, whose views I otherwise respect, are unhappy with the statement without specifying any valid reason.

I'd love to hear the other side of the story on this one.

***Edit***: this blew up way beyond my ability to handle all your replies! The only consensus seems to be that the quote, in isolation, is not wrong, but the broader issue of gender pay gap is anything but this simple. The examples of US women's soccer and UFC were enlightening and something I didn't know previously. I'll try to keep the existing conversation threads going on for as long as I can but I'm too exhausted to engage with the newer ones. Thanks everyone for replying, hell of a first CMV experience :)",1
"CMV: Good people who hold racist ideas are not automatically evil, but they are by definition Racists",1712,453,2018-09-18 22:57:42,"The classic example of this would be a person’s Grandparents that grew up in a different time where it was not considered a bad thing to classify and ultimately look down on a person based on their perceived racial category. Many of not most of the time this person has had limited sustained contact with people of other races and is at times arrogantly used to making broad statements about members of certain racial categories. Most people people don’t have any problems referring their grandparents as racists. Their way of thinking didn’t and doesn’t automatically prevent them from being a good parent, spouse, grandparent, citizen, etc. 

The difficulty today is that people are unwilling to come to terms with the fact that they have racist beliefs, often inherited from older generations that can subtly (and not so subtly) come out in their interactions with people of different races. Racist to them equal someone that is evil and it feels bad to be labeled that way. 

Ultimately being a racist is a negative quality that many otherwise good people have. Being racist can and does cause harm to others and people should be proactive in changing their racist beliefs as a method of self improvement. There certainly are evil people who maliciously harbor racial hatred against others that are racists too. We often consider them more representative of the term Racist than your Grandparents or instance but this is just a matter of degree. 

If a person calls you a racist there is always the possibility that they are right. This should be an opportunity for self reflection rather than an automatic denial.

CMV: Social media channels should remove publicized number of “likes” on posts/pictures/tweets,1703,80,2019-04-18 23:07:14,"I love being able to connect with others and having the opportunity to network on these platforms; however, I believe publicizing the number of likes on a post or picture does more harm than good. I believe that social media users would benefit from not having number of likes on their posts be public (but these analytics could still be seen by the individual).

In a tweet from Kanye West on 20 Sep 2018, he posted: “*we should be able to participate in social media without having to show how many followers or likes we have. Just like how we can turn off the comments we should be able to turn off the display of followers. This has an intense negative impact on our self worth*”.

I think where Kanye is coming from is that seeing the number of likes on social media can lead to comparing your stats to others which can cause a negative impact on one’s mental well-being. While research does state receiving “likes” is associated with increased brain activity that makes you feel good about yourself ([https://www.npr.org/2016/08/09/489284038/researchers-study-effects-of-social-media-on-young-minds](https://www.npr.org/2016/08/09/489284038/researchers-study-effects-of-social-media-on-young-minds)), I couldn’t find much literature or research on the outcomes of removing public ‘like’ numbers from social media. I believe people should still be able to see their likes on a post, but this number shouldn’t have to be public for others.

I don’t understand why the social media platforms don’t give users the option to hide their analytics from others? In my opinion, it does not benefit anyone knowing how many likes another person has compared to how many you have… I just feel like individuals should have the chose to make their numbers private.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Some comments mention websites/platforms such as Youtube - which I do see the functionality and use of likes/dislikes; however, I was thinking more in terms of facebook, instagram, and twitter where these numbers are just on display to everyone.

CMV: We should no longer be buried in cemeteries or caskets when we die.,1699,220,2017-12-28 11:20:27,"From what I understand, caskets or coffins were used to keep the body locked in when people thought they might possibly come back from the dead and crawl their way back up to the surface as some type of zombie. Also, to stop grave robbers from stealing organs or items that the deceased was buried with. 
It seems completely insane to me to spend thousands of dollars on a wooden box just to be buried 6 feet under, never to be seen again. Then spend another few thousand dollars on a gravestone and another on a plot in a cemetery. If everyone chooses to be buried like this, the whole planet would eventually be one giant cemetery. 
Being buried in a casket with a gravestone marking your spot seems completely selfish to me. Not only because the fact that the thousands of dollars spent could have gone to better use but, I️ feel like the majority of people take from the planet more than they try to preserve it. The least we could do when we die is be buried without a box and let the nutrients from our remains go back into the earth. Or get cremated and have our ashes spread somewhere. Having a gravestone above your burial site makes it seem like you want to be remembered as someone important. We’re only here for a short time, it is up to us to choose the legacy we are going to leave behind. Some people will be remembered for a very long time through generations and others will be remembered by only a few. The life we choose to live will determine that. 
I’m not saying that only some people deserve to be remembered but, that’s just how it is. Out of the billions of people on this planet a very small percentage will be remembered for a decent amount of time. But, for some reason, some people think they can have a permanent spot on this planet. As humans we’re no better than any other species trying to survive here. 
I think we should be past this idea of being buried in an expensive box, in a little area of a cemetery, with a fancy gravestone taking up space. ",1
CMV: Kneeling for the Anthem does not disrespect the USA,1697,552,2017-10-30 21:34:59,"I say this as a Canadian who has been following the Anthem Protests relatively closely.

The USA is not a flag. The USA is not a song.

The USA is a collection of thoughts and ideals. Among which three are central

1 - Everyone should be treated equally/fairly.

2 - The government is not perfect.

3 - If you don't like something, you have the right to voice your displeasure (sometimes with weapons).

Therefore kneeling before a flag during a song which isn't your nation, but exercising your belief in the ideas that are your nation, is not disrespectful of the nation.

> But your disrespecting the people who fought and died for that flag

If they fought and died for the flag moreso than they did foe the ideals which it is supposed to represent, then I would argue they deserve the disrespect.

> They are disrespecting a nation which has given them those rights

And therefore using those rights should come before paying lip-service to a flag which represents things you don't agree with.

Things that would change my view

* That the flag, anthem, and government should be more important than those listed ideals
* That those listed ideals are wrong
* That kneeling is not a good form of protest

Edit - Apparently I need to point out that I awarded a delta. 

Well I awarded a delta. It is disrespectful, but the disrespect makes sense.",1
"CMV:You should be able to sue lenders and banks for issuing credit to an identity thief impersonating you, thus ruining your credit score.",1691,179,2017-06-15 23:01:56,"Let me restate that - you should be able to successfully sue the bank, or anyone else, giving them credit in your name.

It only makes sense to steal an identity when the thief gets something out of it.  A useless identification is not worth the trouble.  So, if a bank or lender gives an identity thief credit in your name you should be able to successfully sue the bank for not doing due diligence to ensure they are really dealing with ""you"".

A side effect of this would be more in-person transactions and more personalized service, which may be slightly slower or cost slightly more, but the results would be well worth it for society as institutions would be forced to ""get to know"" their clients a little more and identity theft would be reduced as thieves knew they couldn't use your credit from afar.

EDIT- many people havr given good answers and mentioned how secure loans are.  If that's the case why are so many identities sill stolen? If it's very tough to get a benefit frim the theft why do it?

CMV: Apple is a deceptive company that relies primarily on brand image to sell its overpriced products.,1694,379,2017-09-22 02:45:39,"Apple Inc. used to be a pioneer of technology in the late 20th century with the Macintosh computer and iPod devices, but today they have become a company that relies on inferior rehashes of old technology that they deem as ""innovative"" and market for much more than what they are actually worth. 

A prime example is the iPhone 7 and its missing 3.5mm headphone jack. Removing a smartphone component and replacing it with wireless earbuds that are much easier to misplace, AND requiring the user to purchase a separate lightning-to-3.5mm adapter that costs $10 and is described as ""fragile"" and ""poorly made"". One could say that this is intentional and forces the user to spend more money to replace these parts once they break or are lost. 

Now let's look at the software. Mac OS is exclusive to Apple products, which forces me to pick up one of their $2000+ Macbooks if I want to even touch their operating system. People often say that Mac is better for developers than Windows, but having used Windows, OS X, and Linux, I can say with certainty that OS X is the least capable of the three. The amount of available software that can run on OS X is minimal compared to Windows. For developers, Linux is superior, with greater customization and an enormous online community for help (as opposed to having to contact Apple tech support). And the best part? Linux is FREE.

Compatibility between hardware and software is also an issue. Apple has specifically designed it such that their devices will only function with THEIR equipment. Want to add some songs to your iPhone? Better open up iTunes! Need a new cable? Time to go the Apple Store!

But people will still buy it, because it's Apple, after all. They want to walk around with their fancy white earbuds and their Apple-branded bottles and T-shirts. The company has done such a great job at establishing their brand image over the last few decades that they can send out overpriced, mediocre products and still make money. People are so distracted by the brand that they fail to see this. Apple knows that they will always have dedicated consumers who throw money at them, and as a result, they no longer feel the need to innovate when they can recycle the same concepts year after year. 

EDIT: After reading some responses, probably the one that changed my view the most was that if a person sees an item as being valuable, they are justified in spending money on it. In this case, the demand for an Apple product is not so much the brand image as it is the perceived uses of the product from the perspective of that person. Therefore it is not ""overpriced"" if people *are* willing to pay that much for it. 

Anyway, these comments have provided some new perspective for me. I probably won't get through all the responses but you can consider my view at least somewhat changed. :)

CMV: Popularizing (and perhaps enforcing) a 3 day (or 24 hours in total) work-week (or preferably even less) would only be beneficial to humanity as a whole.,1689,481,2019-02-23 19:51:33,"This is one I've been thinking about for a bit. **Just to clarify things it isn't the 5-day work-week in particular that I've got a problem with. It's the idea of working more than 20-25 hours a week in total regardless of when it's actually worked.**

*Reasons I've got for my view:*

\- **Solves the job crisis** (unemployment/under-employment) we're current having: It encourages job growth by potentially restricting the amount of work that employees can actually do. Simplistic example but if a bank needs a teller for 6 days of the week but each worker is only able to work 3 that effectively creates another job.

\- **Increased productivity:** This is one for the employers. Most people are actually incredible ineffective when made to work solid 8 hour blocks (I understand there are generally smaller breaks within that). We are much more effective working shorter, more intense 60-90 minute breaks before periods of rest. If we weren't expected to work on average 40 hrs a week (with the only feasible way to do that being 9-5/equivalent) there could be more opportunity for employers to allow employees to change the way they work (particularly in white collar work).

\- **More free-time (improve general well-being/mental health):** The majority of the population don't really like to work. It's seen as something we have to suffer through so we can enjoy ourselves on the weekend/pursue hobbies in our spare time. So why do we spend so much time doing it? With food so plentiful (and only a relatively small amount of people needed to work to produce it) we have no real need to work so hard. All we're really doing is supporting a consumerist culture that many scientists would tell you doesn't actually make you any happier.

\- **Ease the potential crisis of automation/smarter AI:** This is a big one for me. Already we're starting to reach the point where millions upon millions of humans may become irrelevant in the economy (self-driving cars/trucks just to name one example). We're already considering concepts like UBI. The 5 day work week will effectively become impossible for most in the next 50 or so years anyway.  Why not get ahead of a potential catastrophe for once and make changes that'll make things easier in the long run.

*Some criticisms I can envision/things I'm unsure on that might lead to a change in view.*

\- **Economic impact (individual and macro)**: Again as money is ultimately a human invention (and because our basic needs in Western cultures at least can be cared for regardless) I don't see why this idea can't work. Maybe some would argue that people wouldn't be paid enough to live but why not? If everyone was limited to 24 hours of work demand for things still set at the prices relative to the 40 hour work week would fall and force everyone to set new prices that the new work-force could actually afford. Even if this is an issue don't we have to tackle it anyway fairly soon with automation around the corner? Maybe an UBI based on increased taxes on companies could add to people's incomes?

**- It would lead to off-shoring of business where regulations wouldn't exist:** Maybe this is a valid point but I feel it exists outside the view I want changed. Ultimately we're going to have to get stricter on big companies regardless because of increasing automation.

**- Enforcement:** I'm ambivalent on whether this should actually be enforced or merely greater efforts made to popularize i. On one hand enforcement may bring with it a whole host of other challenges (business owners/self-employed/ specialized people who HAVE to work longer weeks) but on the other hand I feel it may have to be enforced simply because otherwise the motivation to work longer (and screw everyone else in the process) will always be there.

Obviously much of the world seems to be infatuated with this idea of a 5-day work-week (or even more than those 40 hours) and sometimes I feel a little out there on my own with this view (which makes me question whether it's right or wrong) so I'm interested in opposing viewpoints. **Change my view!**

**EDIT:** So my view has been changed to an extent. I still believe in an abstract thought experiment kind of way that a society built around a 3 day work-week would be better than what we have now. This has though highlighted to me that the only feasible way to achieve it would be to reduce production and for many that's extremely undesirable and/or impossible (because of desire to maintain our current state of living/consumerism/desire for progress/innovation etc). We likely would struggle (at least short-term) to fill all the jobs we currently have which while not a problem for some areas could make getting the basic necessities of life difficult. 

I feel a 4 day work-week is significantly more feasible and is something that could be achieved right now without such a dramatic reduction in production. Thanks for the discussion.",1
CMV: Netflix change their rating system out of greed and tried to make the public think they asked for it.,1683,270,2017-07-19 05:27:02,"I remember just before the swtich, Amy Shumer's Netflix Original Stand-up was getting 1 starred to hell and I have no interest in her comedy. After the switch it showed up in my recommended (or whatever it's called) with high 90's% chance I'd like it.

Bullshit, already after this one instance I'm thinking Netflix is stacking their algorithms in their favor.

I remember Netflix's advertising the change with phrases like, ""You asked and we responded"". I have a hard time believing anything but ""The movie is lagging"" and ""Why did you remove / don't you have ________"" being the only real public concerns.

Now they're defending the move with phrases like ""You can find reviews from other sources"", yeah we can but don't act like you've done the public a big favor my changing it to the still very wrong system.

Before, Netflix was great for me. I'd pick a genre that I liked and 9 times out of 10 if a show had 4+ stars, I ended up liking it.

Now I have way more misses, and I have to resort to using rotten tomatoes which didn't jive with me as well as Netflix star system.

Edit: [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMliusRrr90) is a piece of evidence to consider that Netflix has manipulated the rating system.

CMV: Transgender people should be allowed to serve in the military.,1678,1111,2017-07-26 22:46:30,"Now that Trump recently announced that transgender people are not going to be allowed to serve in the military I want to try to understand the reasoning behind this decision. Transgender people have been fighting for America for some time now and from what I understand this haven't been a larger issue so far. 

Considering that both men and women are serving in the military I don't see how this could make a difference. It would be one thing if women weren't serving and female to male transgender people wanted to join. Considering this is not the case I don't see the logic behind it.

Furthermore I don't understand how Trump can justify making this decision since some transgender people voted for him. Trump said he would work for the LGBTQ+ community and by doing this he is failing some of his voters on a (according to me) non logic decision.",1
"CMV: Now that GitHub has been acquired by Microsoft, the very appeal of the product has dissipated entirely and there is a good reason behind the outrage.",1678,160,2018-06-04 19:26:53,"For those who are unaware, [Microsoft today acquired GitHub](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/3/17422752/microsoft-github-acquisition-rumors), sparking apathy, praise, and dismay among the developer community, many of whom use GitHub for their everyday projects. In this post I would like to lay out my reasons as to why this is poor for the GitHub product and brand, and why I tend to side with the people who are outraged.

**What I am NOT arguing**

*That Microsoft is a bad company.* I personally like Microsoft as a company more than Apple or Oracle and would be more outraged if either of those companies acquired GitHub instead. My reasons for disapproving of the acquisition is not based on my opinions of Microsoft (in fact I have family and friends who work for Microsoft and tend to enjoy Microsoft products).

*That Microsoft will 'destroy' GitHub.* There are arguments floating around that Microsoft tends to destroy any product that it acquires. In my own opinion I believe the status quo will not change much other than certain Microsoft product and account integration that would in fact make GitHub more convenient and accessible for the user.

*That Microsoft is 'antithetical' to the open source culture.* As a company, Microsoft has actually been more friendly to the open source community, especially as a member of the Linux Foundation, than many other companies. However, I would be equally as frustrated if GitHub was acquired by Google, a company with a long record of open sourcing their products such as Chrome (Chromium) and Android (AOSP).

*That companies like Microsoft should stop acquiring every company.* I personally do not like the acquisition of every small tech startup under the sun by large, big X companies, but that is besides the point.

**What I am arguing**

GitHub is a small company with a large responsibility of hosting a plethora of files -- business, educational, and personal -- and run by a company that was founded upon open source principles. With great power comes great responsibility; however, GitHub would never have sold or used files uploaded to its servers by its users without facing massive repercussions in the success of its very company.

Now, here comes Microsoft.

Now that GitHub will no longer be a storage hub run by a small business and instead run by a large company with relatively infinite amounts of resources, there is now much more wiggle room to infringe on the rights and trust of its users without facing repercussions that would destroy the company; GitHub's entire business model was based on user trust whereas Microsoft's entire business model is not wholly based on such.

Anyone wanting to develop a product that would compete against any product of any big X company could have previously uploaded to GitHub with no fear at all. Now, such is not the case and the *pacifistic* nature of GitHub as a platform, the primary appeal of the company and the only feature preventing everyone from migrating to an alternative such as BitBucket, has now been completely dissipated.

**Edit 1:** Loving the discussion. Keep it coming! I'll quit responding for a few hours to get some sleep as it's late right now.

CMV: A pill to stop gender dysphoria would be objectively a better choice,1670,1356,2018-08-30 05:04:06,"This seemed to offend people and I don't get why. Some people experience gender dysphoria, and want to be the opposite gender. And the current treatment is to make them appear to be the opposite gender, through changes in clothing, voice therapy, hormonal treatments that last a lifetime, and or a series of plastic surgeries. And all this comes with a lot of social stigma, and many people write them off as sexual/romantic partners. It's very costly, invasive, and to become passing takes years if ever.

We have developed psychiatric drugs for all kinds of mental health issues, including depression and anxiety. We tell depressed people to seek treatment, even if at the moment they just want to kill themselves. Because they might not want to take such a drastic action if they were getting treated. Pretty much a sick brain doesn't always know best.

There's no drug to effectively treat gender dysphoria, and I don't even think it's feasible to try to develop such a thing. However, in a hypothetical world where you can treat gender dysphoria with either a daily drug similar in practice to an antidepressant, or with transitions genders, I think the drug would be objectively better. And I think it would be fair to mandate people to try this drug before giving them a green light to transition.",1
CMV: Eating a donut every Friday morning is not a big deal,1670,400,2019-07-12 21:17:41,"Every Friday, I bring donuts in to work from a local donut shop. I eat one of them every Friday. I know that a donut is not a healthy breakfast (particularly the icing-filled, powdered-sugar-covered ones I like) in itself, but I feel that in the grand scheme of a balanced diet every other meal of the week and an overall healthy lifestyle, it's insignificant. 

To put a finer point on it, I think a donut is *a little bit bad*, but the enjoyment of eating it outweighs the small dietary imperfection...this is the same mental calculus we'd use to justify eating anything not-perfectly-healthy, so feel free to substitute ""donut"" in your mind with ""ice cream cone"" or ""frappachino"" or whatever resonates with you. 

The local shop doesn't have nutrition facts posted, but let's assume the donut I am eating is substantially similar to [this one from Dunkin](https://www.calorieking.com/us/en/foods/f/calories-in-donuts-vanilla-kreme-filled-donut/5iVPcfvoToC4hfAMpkGUBg):

- 380 calories

- 23g fat

- 10g saturated fat

- 42g carbs

- 22g sugar

A calorie calculator says that i should be eating about 2,800 calories/day, so this donut is 13.5% of my daily requirement or 2% of my weekly need. Using the 3,500 cal per pound guideline, a donut a week is about 5.5 lbs/year. Of course, my usual eating and exercising routine will mean that I'm not retaining all of that since my diet still averages less than 2,800 calories/day.

So I guess, convince me to not eat a donut on donut Friday by showing how a single meal per week with disproportional sugar and fat is significantly bad given that my overall diet is still, on average, appropriate for my body's needs. Or at least, bad enough that the dietary downside is not worth the pleasure of eating it.",1
"CMV: The electoral college is dumb, anti-democratic and doesn't even accomplish any of the outcomes its supporters claim are its purpose.",1670,1286,2019-02-28 02:46:05,"1. People claim the electoral college ""prevents California, Texas, and New York from determining the outcome of the presidential election""

But it is only under the electoral college that states vote as blocks. More people voted for Donald Trump in Los Angeles (620,285) than voted at all in Alaska (246,588) and Wyoming (248,742) combined. Their votes were switched and discounted. 

Even ignoring that states dont vote as a block, voters in those three states don't account for half of the voters in the country. Even if everyone who voted in those three states in 2016 decided to vote for the same person it would only have been 27,903,726 votes, 22.55% of the total voter turnout. Nowhere near enough to ""decide"" the outcome. 

If you want voters in small states to have a bigger voice than voters in large states, giving their votes a multiplier would be much fairer. If people in Wyoming just had their vote counted 3.73 (or whatever) times as much as Californian votes. At least under that system dissenting votes within a state would be counted how they are cast instead of being switched. You could apportion the voting power multiplier by an index of population per congressperson with whatever state was lowest set as 1 vote or you could apportion it by a simple formula based on population ranking like this:

>Vote multiplier = (state population rank + 19) / 20

However, I do not advocate for this type of system either. One vote per person is fundamentally more fair.

2. People claim that under a popular vote system candidates would ignore everywhere but the most populous areas. Under the current system candidates only have an incentive to campaign in swing states, how is that any better than the imagined problem of candidates only campaigning in populous areas? For example if Hillary Clinton could have changed 73,515 minds in Florida and Arizona in 2016 she would have won the whole election. On the other hand convincing 100,000 Trump voters in Idaho to switch their vote would have gained her nothing. 375 out of 399 campaign events in 2016 took place in just 12 states. Half of all states had no candidate events during the Presidential election (not counting primaries which are a whole other unrelated issue).

Furthermore, Under a system with one person, one vote, candidates would campaign anywhere they felt they could persuade voters to vote for them. That calculus would be different for every candidate. Certainly some candidates would campaign primarily in populous centers, but that would not be a winning strategy for other candidates. Consider the state of Illinois. It has a gigantic liberal city in it that accounts for about 75 percent of the states population. Despite that in 2014 they elected a Republican governor who carried every county but one (Cook, 40 percent of population). Now, do you think that candidate campaigned solely in Chicago? Why then would a candidate who truly wanted to represent rural america campaign solely in cities?

As of the 2013 census only 28.2 percent of people in america live in cities over 100k population. Even winning all of the votes in those cities wouldnt come close to winning you the election. And again, it is only under the electoral college where cities vote as a block. 


3. People say the founding fathers never intended for people to directly elect the president and that the electors were meant to make the choice independently and prevent an uneducated populous from electing a demagogue.

That is clearly not how the system is working, so their intentions dont mean anything.

CMV: Shifting to an 18-year US Supreme Court term would have substantial benefits that would outweigh the drawbacks,1666,111,2018-02-28 02:46:31,"I think we would be better off if Supreme Court justices were nominated to 18-year terms rather than lifetime appointments.  My vision for this would be that a seat would come up every other year, at the beginning of odd-numbered years.  If a justice were to retire from their seat or die during their 18-year term, a new justice could be appointed to fill the remainder of their term.

The benefits I see of such an approach:

* Supreme Court nominations become slightly lower-stakes:  Right now, when you nominate a justice in their 40s, they could conceivably serve on the bench for 40+ years before dying or retiring.  This makes every nomination an apocalyptic event.  I don't think that issue would go away entirely with 18-year terms, as that's still pretty long, but it would lessen the stakes somewhat.

* Supreme Court nominations become more predictable:  We currently live in a world where we never know when a seat will come up to be filled; before Scalia's death, we had 4 justices who could decide to retire or come into ill-health at any moment (Breyer, Ginsburg, Kennedy, Scalia), raising the possibility that one president could potentially re-shape the judiciary dramatically if he/she got lucky.  *Edit* as an added benefit, the phenomenon of SCOTUS justices deciding whether to ""wait out"" certain Presidents they don't like or retire under Presidents they do like would go away, which I think is a good thing.

* More democratic responsiveness in the Supreme Court: The prevailing philosophy on the Court can and does change over time, but it can take a very long time for that to happen with lifetime tenure, and the role luck plays in the timing of SCOTUS openings.  With more predictable openings, if the public spends 10 years pushing for the court to move in one direction through their votes in elections, they can actually re-shape the Court.  (I know this is a double-edged sword, because in theory the Court isn't always considered an institution that is supposed to be particularly democratically responsive).

* Removing SCOTUS battles from election cycles: If you could have the vacancies occur at the beginning of every odd-numbered year, they would be as far from the next election as possible, diminishing as far as possible the incentive to wait until an election before confirming a justice.  And every time people went to the polls, they would know that their vote was directly impacting a SCOTUS nomination within the next few months.

* Less disincentive to nominating older judges: Not that nominating young judges is a *bad* thing, necessarily, but because of the stakes of lifetime appointments, there is a big incentive to look for really young justices rather than necessarily the best person to fill the role.  In today's world, it's impossible to imagine nominating a justice who is 60 or 65 years old, because you could be giving up 10-15 years of their service on the back end relative to a justice who is 45-50.  With an 18-year term, politicians would have more flexibility to choose slightly older and more experienced justices if they wished.

I know this would require a Constitutional amendment, and I know that will never happen, but I wanted to float it as at least a thought experiment.  What am I missing?  CMV!

CMV: Death penalties should not exist because the possibility of killing an innocent man outweigh the benefits of executing a criminal!,1664,372,2020-05-30 18:32:11,"How do you know with 100% certainty that a person has committed the crime that he is being accused of? even if all the forensic equipment the DNA testing print gathering and witnesses the possibility that all the signs pointing towards an innocent person being the culprit of a major crime is still possible! the hair found on the crime scene can be purposefully placed, the prints found on the murder weapon might be a coincidence, the witness that claims to have seen this person commit the crime is under a lot of pressure and his memory has failed him, he believes that what he saw was true but it isn't.

i remember reading about a case where they arrested a woman that worked at a q-tip factory because some of her DNA got to the q-tips used by the police. ([Article](https://www.iso.org/news/2016/07/Ref2094.html) not the same one i red but its the same case)

there are people that confess to crimes they didn't commit and get paid to go to jail, some mental illnesses can be used to make a person believe they did something they didn't.

there can always be some piece of the puzzle missing or some slight chance that the person being executed is not the real culprit.

if I am not wrong there are around 50 countries that still practice death penalties and i would like to know why is it taking so long to get rid of this inhumane practice.

i tried to not bring up the argument that it is straight up inhumane which it is but furthermore it is illogical to give a permanent punishment to a person that we aren't sure is the culprit 100% and we can never be.

there was a similar discussion made about death penalties like 7 months ago but the reasons op gave against death penalties were different.

CMV: Workplace cafeterias should not make a profit.,1667,162,2019-10-12 02:47:53,"I'm not very knowledgeable about the topic, but worked in a hospital cafeteria in high school. The food they served to staff and guests was (and still is) extremely overpriced, and they always made moves to cut staff hours in favor of profit - even when those extra staff members were helpful. Don't companies already make enough money from other areas? I feel they should charge lower prices for food rather than making money from employees and guests.

I may be convinced of the argument for making enough money for shipping supplies, paying cafeteria workers, etc. Even then, it seems those expenses could come from other areas instead of from the company's own staff. In my experience, however, most workplaces try to make a profit from selling their food, not just pay necessary expenses. CMV Reddit!

Edit: Thanks everyone for your replies! I'll try to respond to you all as soon as I can.

Edit2: Sorry for poor wording. I didn't mean to say say food should be free for employees in the post, just at a reduced price to not make a profit. Then, if food prices truly needed to be high to keep the cafeteria budget neutral, maybe it would be possible to pull profit from other areas in order to provide employees with lower priced food. These were my original thoughts, hope that's more clear now. Thanks for the great discussion.",1
CMV: the left-right political spectrum is a largely useless classification system that does more harm than good.,1666,178,2018-04-23 22:18:06,"Politics, and its related topics, are an exceedingly multidimensional space and our obsession with mapping people and organizations to an approximate coordinate on a single dimensional scale does more to obfuscate our convictions and beliefs than it does to help identify them. In addition to being insufficient as a classifier, it imparts undue baggage due to ""spectrum proximity"" with unrelated views. As an example:

* If I am a strong proponent of states' rights and individual responsibility, then these convictions would be more typically associated with *right\-wing* politics, and therefore I would occupy a place on the spectrum that is ""closer"" to *extreme\-right* views like, say, white nationalism.
* On the other hand, if I'm in favor of amnesty for large swaths of undocumented immigrants, then this conviction would be more typically associated with *left\-wing* politics, and so now I'm positioned closer to *ultra\-left* views like, say, Marxism.
* But let's say I hold both of the above views. When I've actually expressed both of these opinions before, I've been accused of political *centering*, as though the only option we have left is to ""average it out"", because darn it if we don't somehow reduce it all back down to a single dimension again.

The above are obviously just specific examples \(and perhaps not the best ones\), but the root of my view here is that despite the ubiquitous usage of the left\-right spectrum, I find that it:

* doesn't accurately indicate which positions *are* held by an individual
* can implicitly suggest positions that *aren't* held by an individual
* and is ultimately counterproductive to the point that it should be eschewed unless accompanied by sufficient clarification so as to render it redundant anyway.

"CMV: People should stop focusing on “useless degrees” and instead focus on the fact that the job market is full of meaningless, arbitrary and unfulfilling jobs",1662,205,2020-08-20 02:20:21,"I study a classic useless Liberal Arts degree at a fancy institution and I’ve become very accustomed to the scoffs and jokes about my “unemployable” future. I know. I’ve accepted it. I used to get a lot of anxiety about this stuff, worrying about my life 5 years from now. I used to wonder if there’s something wrong with me for wanting to put a gun to my head after looking at the kind of internships, grad roles and training schemes that are available. Most of them are boring financial services roles, consulting jobs that involve useless administrative tasks, PR work and more.

But then I read some of this book called “Bullshit Jobs” by David Graeber. And it really did encapsulate everything I have secretly believed about the job force for much of my life so far. No matter how many people tell me “smart students will go onto work smart jobs in banking or law or the civil service” I cannot help agreeing with Graeber that most of these jobs actually have close to zero impact on society and even sometimes only have a more negative impact on the world. A lot of them involve tasks that are filled with useless word jumbo, snooze-fest meetings and days where you sit in an office watching YouTube while pretending go to work. 

I remember doing a short consulting work experience thing and thinking the idea of change management seemed like the perfect example of a job that’s been invented just so some pretend-smart person could get paid. 

“When did creativity suddenly mean suffering?” - Graeber

This is where my view on useless degrees come in. Yes I know so many degrees are completely inapplicable to jobs, and cost way too much money. But why does studying something that is ultimately still fascinating and important to some aspect of society - like Classical Civilisations or Anthropology or Film or Literature mean you’re just some dumb pretentious young person who’s wasting your life? I totally understand the more practical importance of STEM degrees but even having a biology degree nowadays will have you struggling to make ends meet, unless you go into finance or marketing or whatever.


EDIT: Just wanna say that I think the fact that people have to pay thousands for some degrees that won’t guarantee a good income to pay back student loans and such, is a huge problem that should be addressed in the future. What I mean is that the actual existence of these degrees or the knowledge you get from them shouldn’t be degraded because the job market’s problems are probably worse.

Also, change management is an example I thought of myself that I now see may be incorrect. But in the actual book Graeber gives many other examples, not change management but mentions titles like “human resources consultant”.",1
"CMV: I have never seen an argument AGAINST Net Neutrality, that shows knowledge or understanding of how the internet works. So give me one",1663,558,2018-08-05 15:13:52,"Okay now that all the mainstream hype over this is over lets get real here.

Before I get started: **If you don't feel knowledgeable enough to make a case against Net Neutrality but want to see a debate, Please upvote so people who are knowledgeable can see this and make their case against it.**No offence but I thing we all deserve to here/see people who know what they are talking about (ie: network technicians, server/client programmers etc.) discussing this issue. Don't get me wrong I like seeing people taking interest in a field that I am in. but after a while the misinformation starts to pile on and it gets cringe worthy real quick.

For those of you who don't know how data works (regarding computers of course)  Lets me briefly explain:All Data that is transferred over the internet in converted into Bytes(or 8 bits for the tech savvy). What is bytes?  That's not important. What is important is that everything: Video, Text, Music, etc. EVERYTHING is converted into bytes.  And here's the really important part. 1 Bytes takes up the same amount of space no matter what it represents.  Thus: 1 Byte of Video takes up the same amount of space as 1 byte of text.

For all the people who did basic Computer Science/Information Technology Let that sink in real Good I cant make this stuff up there are literally people stating like its Fact: ""Video Data takes up more bandwidth than text Data""

So if you have a data plan that allows to 1 byte per second. it would take you 1 second to download the video and 1 second to download the Text. Also that 1 byte would cost ISPs the same amount to transfer.  Okay so now I know what you're thinking: what if people send more videos, 10 more videos to be exact(at the same time)? And to that I say: Well to send more videos(at the same time) you need more bandwidth, 10 bytes worth more worth of bandwidth to be exact.. Note: I didn't say you need 10 more bytes worth of ""video"" bandwidth!!!    Because as you know...  1 byte per ""whatever"" takes up the same amount of space.  So all you need is 10 more bytes worth of bandwidth.

But here's what ISP want to do:ISPs want to sell us..   Video bandwidth, Music Bandwidth, Email Bandwidth etc..  instead of just selling us bandwidth and letting us do what we want with our bandwidth. The only reason for trying to sell us different types of bandwidth is to trick us into paying them more. And the reason I said TRICK! is because bandwidth doesn't work that was.  This is Fact!

A server doesn't see 1 byte of video and say: ""oh boy this is gonna take up more space because videos are heavy, better get ready""  Because a server doesn't even know a video is inside that byte, Because it doesn't need to know.

**TL:DR:** ISPs are trying to trick people who don't know how the internet works into paying them more, they are doing this by incorrectly describing how data in transferred over the internet. But people are too blinded by politics to see it.

CMV: I Don’t Believe In Saying The Pledge In School.,1668,664,2017-11-14 22:02:14,"I’m an American high schooler, and like most we say the pledge, second period, day after day. Almost none of the students actually say it (at least out loud). I am among those many. I often question, “what if I don’t want to pledge allegiance to the ‘republic’? What if I feel America is rapidly declining and I no longer believe in what the government and America stand for?” Its hard for me to see how to interpret this in any other way. I also dislike the part about “one nation, under God”. This strikes me as odd because who’s to say America is “under God” , even under any gods, if any at all. I thought the government wasn’t supposed to promote any specific religion? Finally, “liberty and justice for all.” I don’t believe there is justice for all, (or at least not “just” justice). There are so many court cases where, for example, a black person is treated unjustly, in modern day America. I just don’t see why we say the pledge anymore if, in my opinion, it is so wrong. People aren’t even thinking about what they are saying anymore. I just want a different perspective.",1
"CMV: Masculinity is not toxic. Being a polite, but ""masculine"" man comes naturally to most men and should not be treated as a threat.",1658,735,2018-07-31 02:21:36,"I am a 35-year-old Finnish (straight) man, living in Finland. I have also lived in Sweden during 2010-2015. I am married with kids. I would consider my wife as a pragmatic feminist, and as such, probably myself as well, albeit with the problem regarding what counts as equality.

Anyway, I have not faced issues in this field until very recently, as this neo-progressive phenomenon related to PC and terminology has landed in daily life in Finland.

Let me tell you a story. I was raised by my mother, a hard working single parent (dad was an absent alcoholic) who taught me most values about life. Obviously this doesn't mean she was a feminist, but I would consider her as a pragmatic seeker for an effective process towards synergy. She felt (rightly) so that men and women are inherently different, mentally, biologically, etc. which obviously meant there would always be dynamic differences.

I still believe this, in my 30's, after doing my own studies and after learning even more from my wife who is a teacher.

This doesn't mean there should be any inequality, but it doesn't mean there should be forced equality either.

But to my topic: I have never bumped into this argument in my life. In the Nordics we have a pretty equal society, women have been a part of commerce, politics and academia for a long time, and excluding a few cases, harrasment nor discrimination has not been common.

Hell, I have been harrassed more than I have heard of women being harrassed (obviously it happens) in my circle of friends.

But lately, I have been told by young women not to mansplain, not to manspread, and a friend of mine caused a stranger crying and shaking after asking her, albeit in a slightly drunken way ""how was her evening"" in a bar. We were thrown out (in Finland) because of ""harrasment"". Wrong bar, it was too young and trendy. But still, this was not obnoxius behaviour, that I can say.

What is this masculinity that is being discussed? Am I completely blind and oblivous to things happening, as I simply cannot comprehend why younger generation has become so obsessed in the common traits which are related to being a man?

I am apolitical, although quite liberal (in the Nordic sense, not US), polite, well-educated, thoughtful and cannot understand. I do not believe there is a phenomenon called patriarchy in the world. It is absolutely manifesting itself in singular scenarios, companies, sure. But to say I as a man am somehow faulty or toxic or dangerous as a masculine person is wrong and outright offensive.

Edit 1: There obviously is a contextual issue in my terminology. I think the point still remains so I will adjust my perspective a bit when reading through the replies.

Edit 2: We have established the toxicity part. If mods allow, I would like to use this thread to still discuss the latter part of my masculinity argument.

Edit 3: A lot of replies, I will try to go through each and every reply and consider their value. ",1
CMV: The 24 hour clock (military time) is superior to the 12 hour clock.,1659,326,2017-11-08 02:40:25,"I think my reasoning on this one is fairly self explanatory. I feel that it is unnecessarily confusing to refer to the 13th hour of the day as 1 o'clock PM. I feel like the concepts of AM and PM are dated and probably originated from a time where humans were much more dependent on natural sunlight to be productive. With the advent of artificial light noon is no longer really the ""middle"" of the workday so I see no reason to reset the clock and start counting from one again every time we hit noon. If the clock just reset at 24 o'clock each night it would just be a more sensible, less confusing system.",1
"I believe that we should have a 'Reverse Boot Camp' when veterans return from active duty, in order to better transition them back into society. CMV",1650,159,2014-01-14 22:33:14,"So, from my limited understanding of this, I've read that PTSD and Depression (just two examples) are reaching [ridiculous levels](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/10/prweb11195568.htm) [of diagnosis.](http://www.nami.org/Template.cfm?Section=Depression&Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&ContentID=88939) It would seem that coming back from the events of war causes significant changes in one's mental state, and that transitioning back to society is extremely difficult, even for the soldiers who are 'fine.'

Now, we know a lot of ways to [combat PTSD](http://www.helpguide.org/mental/post_traumatic_stress_disorder_symptoms_treatment.htm) [and depression](http://www.helpguide.org/mental/depression_tips.htm), and [there's new studies coming out all the time, so it's clearly something we as a society care about](http://depts.washington.edu/hhwb/Thm_Mental.html).

It just seems to me that generally, American society continually spouts the whole, ""I support the troops"" mindset, but what does that really mean? The biggest problems that face troops don't have to do with supplies, funding, or a lack of training going into the conflict, but their transition back into society afterwards. We train them to go *into* the conflict, why would we not train them to *come out* of it?

If we **know** that many, many troops struggle with this, and we **know** how to treat it (obviously each case is different, but I mean as an overarching topic we do know treatment methods), it seems like a no brain-er that we should be doing something about it. In my mind, the best way to do this would be to have some sort of mandatory program for soldiers when they return. It could be just a month or two long (after which those soldiers who still need help will at least have the resources readily available to them), and it would consist of living and working as a group to achieve peaceful goals, possibly [raising animals](http://www.helpguide.org/life/pets.htm), [spending a lot of time outside](http://depts.washington.edu/hhwb/Thm_Mental.html), etc etc. Even for those soldiers who aren't suffering from these serious issues would benefit from some down time to reduce stress levels and transition back into everyday life.

**EDIT: /u/groovyoctopus suggested possibly doing volunteer work, I thought it was worth mentioning up here as well so new readers could see it.**

The money for all of this, in the perfect world, would come from all the excess military spending that this country pumps out (if you don't believe that, just [Google excess military spending](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=excess+military+spending) and see what comes up).

One final supporting point is that [over half of all enlisted forces are between the ages of 18-30](http://www.statisticbrain.com/demographics-of-active-duty-u-s-military/). This means that most people who are enlisted are still relatively young, and have not spent a lot of time off in the real world on their own. So another argument is that since they have not spent a lot of time interacting with society as a regular citizen, then they have very little to 'fall back' on in terms of old habits or old feelings to relate to.

So that's the thinking behind my view. I'm really interested in reading some arguments as to why we **don't** already do this.

Thanks everyone!

P.S. I understand that funding might be the biggest issue people are going to raise. I would prefer to hear other arguments against this, because funding is the most apparent/easiest one to spot, but also the easiest one to refute.

P.P.S. This whole topic was sparked in my mind over this recent [This American Life story](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/515/transcript) (skip to ""Deep, Dark, Open Secret"").

EDIT: I've already clarified in comments below, so instead of posting the same thing to each reply, the program would definitely provide ample time to spend with family and friends. I think that the program could be structured in such a way that veterans could commute to the camp in order to preform tasks, much like a 9-5 job. It would not necessitate being away from their families for another month or two after the end of deployment.

EDIT #2: Also, the details of the program aren't what matters so much about my post. If you have suggestions about what soldiers could be doing during this reverse boot camp time, I'd gladly hear them. However, my view isn't so much about *what* they should be doing to re-integrate, but the fact that they should be doing *something*, and that *something* should be organized and paid for by the military that put them in a combat zone.

EDIT #3: For anyone who want's to say that we already have programs in place (like individual counseling, etc), I am aware of that, and that is a valid point. However, before you post it, I'd like you to take a look at [veteran suicide rates](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/01/14/169364733/u-s-militarys-suicide-rate-surpassed-combat-deaths-in-2012), or just google it if you don't like that article. They're out of control. So it would appear that the system we have in place isn't working. If you have evidence to refute that, I'd love to read up on it.

**EDIT #4: It has been brought to my attention that re-integration programs do exist in each branch of the military (I guess someone thought this was a good idea before!). However, from the descriptions I've read they sound terribly ineffective (extremely dry, boring, no one takes them seriously, etc). I guess the CMV has transitioned from ""There should be these programs,"" to ""These programs need to change."" Thanks to everyone for their input so far! I'll do my best to keep replying below, but at this point I guess changing my original view is impossible because these programs already exist. However if people wish to keep the discussion going from where it has evolved to (""I believe these programs are ineffective and need to change""), feel free to put your input below.**",1

And there are WAY too many participants who are gullible idiots.",1638,161,2019-10-23 03:15:16,"I can’t tell you how many supposed word-for-word dialogues are said in that sub, that really belong more in r/thathappened. The OP will have a story that is generally believable... But then either certain points within the post or in their responses to questions are obviously bullshit.

People comment stuff like “wow that’s crazy that the other person actually said that, you’re clearly NTA”. Wellllll.... my view is that it probably sounds unbelievable because it IS unbelievable and untrue.

People there have no issue calling an entire post out as a shitpost when it happens. But when they’ve determined that the story seems true, then they respond as if every single thing happened exactly as OP says. 

Every single OP posting in that sub has been involved in some sort of situation where they are questioning if they are the asshole or not. This is clearly a setup ripe for them saying things in a biased way to make themselves look better / the other person look worse. I mean that happens on the internet all the time, but if there was ever a place for that to happen a lot, it’d be in that sub.

This is so much the case, that that sub has to constantly remove “validation-seeking” posts. (which is when OP is clearly NTA and just wants to be told that the other person sucks.)

So I don’t understand why everyone understands this concept generally, yet doesn’t apply it to individual points within a post.

I usually call out the stuff I think is bullshit, and people freak the fuck out and downvote it. I’ll even say that IF op is being 100% honest, that I agree with them, but that I don’t believe [a certain specific part] and people get all annoyed. It’s like questioning OP is just not culturally allowed there. 

(Except it totally is when it comes to determining if the post is a shitpost?!)

I understand that this is way too.. idk difficult? for mods to have any sort of rule for. But my point is it’s wrong for there to be a culture of downvoting anyone who doubts the veracity of something OP has said. So to be clear I am not saying that the mods need to change something about the sub. 

It makes it not fun. I’ve been active on that and many other subs since joining Reddit 2 years ago. I really don’t see this phenomenon happening in other subs. Usually Redditors love to call out bullshit.

Updates:

Edit: I understand that fiction exists, and that it can be entertaining to read fiction. Anyone who responds to this with something along the lines of “we go into it knowing it’s basically fiction” wouldn’t fall into the category of gullible people I’m talking about. If the categories are:
1. Gullible idiots that believe everything said there (outside of shitposts)
2. People viewing it as fictional entertainment and are participating despite knowing it might not all be true
3. People who actively don’t believe a lot of what’s said there

Then I’m not sure the exact ratio of each group, but I’m only referring to the first group.

Edit 2: To put a finer point on it, I’m mostly referring to the culture of shaming people who express doubts about something OP has said. I’m not saying the mods need to change anything about their rules.

Edit 3: I shouldn’t have used the word “majority”. I am not prepared to defend the actual % of posts that have lies in them. The sub is huge and active and that number would change every hour. Sorry for using a blanket statement in the title.

**Changed My Views:**

(I’m lazy and don’t want to have to keep explaining to new commenters)

I now agree that one of the reasons it’s pointless to call out lies is that OP is just going to claim they’re not lying, and no one can prove anything either way, so it ends up not affecting anything. If it were more common for people to voice their doubts, each thread would just get clogged up, and it would cease to be about the judgement. Therefore people go into that particular sub “giving OP the benefit of the doubt”. As with any complex situation, there needs to be certain agreed-upon truths/facts, otherwise everything is meaningless and everyone is having different conversations.",1
CMV: People who drive loud cars and motorcycles are inconsiderate assholes,1642,625,2015-06-29 04:56:12,"It's my view that people that drive motorcylces and cars with those loud mufflers are simply inconsiderate in that they don't care about other's peace and quiet.  
  
I've always found them annoying, say you're reading or studying at a cafe and they roar by louder than an invading Mongolian horde. God forbid they stop at a light since now you're stuck listening to that ungodly chortle for a good minute or so.  
  
I'm a single parent now and live by a fairly well travelled road. They wake my baby up consistently, and he has a hard time with his sleeping habits.  
  
It's a choice to make your vehicle that loud, not a necessity. On top of that, the rider or driver does not have to hear his most of his own racket since most of the sound is projected backwards.  
  
These people are assholes. I wish I could wake them up every 15 minutes with their own stupid vehicle.

I had no idea this post would get this big and, as much as I'd like to, I can't possibly hope to discuss this with all of you. Thank you to everyone, on both sides of the issue, for your reasoned and very interesting replies.  
  
The argument that got me closest to changing my view was surely that of safety. Other people are saying being loud is not as important for safety as actually driving well on a motorcycle, and this seems to be coming from cyclists as well, so unless I see some sort of peer reviewed study over anecdotal evidence that line of thinking isn't doing it for me.
  
My favorite arguments were those along the lines of ""It's a free country, you're the one that's being inconsiderate by expecting the riders to be silent."" The image of some tatted up Hell's Angel roaring through town and impinging on the hearing of 500 people and then screaming ""IM BEING OPPRESSED"" when someone suggests he tones down the throttle is simply delicious.  A special thank you to everyone who called me a pussy via PM. It's good to know you care so much.

Just a caveat here, there's a few comments in this thread that highlight the problem with some drivers very well. I'm not gonna call anyone out by name but the gist is that I'm annoyed over a minor inconvenience and I should get over it, people like driving loud cars and they're gonna keep doing it.   
  
I don't think any new parent would call it a minor inconvenience after spending 30 minutes putting a baby to sleep only to be woken up 5 minutes into his nap by a purposely loud vehicle. **But this post isn't JUST about me, or my baby.** These drivers drive past countless people. People who are gravely ill. People who own dogs that will shit on the carpet because they're scared of the sound. Nursing homes. Someone with a migraine headache. People who work the night shift. And all these little acts, each one is a little fuck you from the driver. And all these little fuck yous add up to one huge mega fuck you to your community. **People with empathy get mad at this not just because it inconveniences them but because they know it inconveniences many others as well and the act is seen as grossly disrespectful because of that.**  
  
One PM I got said:  
  
>I drive a loud car. Why? Because I like it.  
  
He doesn't take the time to think, ""How will my actions affect those around me? Is there any chance the thing I am about to do will harm someone, and, if that is the case, should I still do the thing?"" No, this person doesn't give a shit. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the very essence of being inconsiderate. ^and^an^asshole

CMV This GCSE maths exam question about counting calories is totally appropriate.,1626,674,2019-06-12 18:46:19,"Second edit: I'd sum up my view now as this is Still PC gone mad, but they kind of had it coming for not making it slightly more balanced. I think a maths question using the word calories is always going to upset someone, clearly.  We shouldn't have to censor something like this, but maybe blindsighting the 3% of people in a maths exam isn't worth the backlash from the general public and probably isn't fair. They could have done the question slightly better I guess. Shame this made such a stink. Teach calorie awareness where it matters (that's everywhere in real life folks)

EDIT: Some great replies, getting tough to answer them all now- Might not reply to ones where i feel I've already responded to that point somewhere else.

In the UK there was a question on the latest GCSE maths paper that read: 

“There are 84 calories in 100g of banana. There are 87 calories in 100g of yogurt. Priti has 60g of banana & 150g of yogurt for breakfast. Work out the total number of calories"" 

A number of parents and students across the UK have started complaining about a question regarding a woman's calorie intake, leading to it trending on twitter 

I mean, it's actually one of those cases where maths can help you IRL.

There's nothing wrong with the question and the board should not feel any pressure to apologize or remove it. CMV",1
"CMV: While both have their benefits and drawbacks, the downsides of Canadian healthcare are no where near as bad as the downsides of the US healthcare system.",1631,919,2018-03-16 10:29:31,"I see that the number one complaint when people discuss Canadian vs. American healthcare is that Canadian healthcare has longer wait times. I don't argue that this isn't true, but the question is does it matter? 

Let's take emergency room wait times for example. In Canadian hospital emergency rooms, there are two lines - one for people who have actual emergencies such as can't breathe, or bleeding out, and the other for people who have non-threatening conditions like a fever, or I feel icky. For people in the first line who have actual emergencies they are admitted right away and are treated immediately, so is this really a drawback? Maybe the lines are so long because there are more people who feel comfortable seeking healthcare because of how easily accessible this is (this is somewhere you can feel free to change my view, try to prove that long lines are actually due to something that is intrinsic to the universality of Canadian health care). 

Ultimately, it boils down to the fact that Canadian healthcare is more fair because it doesn't allow individuals of higher social status to cut the line, and it is of course more accessible to people who need. In the process, this means that wait times have to increase. This seems better than having people refusing to go the hospital (taking home remedies, denial etc.), or going to the hospital and being lobbed with enormous debt if they don't have insurance (or sometimes even if they do have insurance but their condition isn't covered). 

So please change my view

Edit: Thanks everyone for the wonderful discussion. /u/TheImpaledNazarene and /u/tiddlypeeps convinced me the most. They brought attention to the fact that Canada does have a back log with imaging which can be a problem since imaging can be used to diagnose serious illnesses or start a course of treatment, and delays can potentially be harmful to the patient. They also brought attention to the fact that not all treatments are paid for by single payer - only the ones that are of reasonable cost that provide some benefit to the patient's well-being. But this shouldn't mean that someone with the means to pay for an experimental treatment should be denied from exercising that choice, especially when single payer refuses to pay for it.

"CMV: It's impractical to use ""Innocent until proven Guilty"" approach to non-legal, everyday settings.",1628,240,2018-10-28 09:34:16,"I have been inspired by people saying that we should be using the ""Innocent until proven Guilty"", not only in a strictly legal settings, but as a way of life. While this is definitely the most fair, I fail to see how practical it is. 


Starting off, nearly 100% of our interpersonal decisions are made from links of trust, not proof. If two different people tell me a different story, and one of the two people were someone I knew, I would trust my friend over the stranger. When there is no proof, and the only things left are two personal accounts, I would trust my friend who I would know of their character. Now, I am not saying that my friend is always right, or that it is rational to only trust someone who you personally know. I am saying it is impractical to NOT believe your friend on the account that there is no evidence. 


Let's pretend that I was a boss. Two people are held for an interview. One person is rumored to have a terrible personality. The other person isn't talked about. Given similar specs, I would hire the person without those rumors. Is it possible that they were false rumors? Of course. But I don't care about justice. It is more convenient for me to just choose someone without those circumstances regardless of the truth. There is no point in me sorting through their drama when there is a much easier alternative. 

To me, most people live their lives under the assumptions that our acquaintances would not lie to us. And that makes sense. If you think otherwise, please CMV

EDIT: Clarifying that I am referring to ""reasonable beyond all doubts"" as a criteria for proof. Strictly in legal sense, my personal accounts of that person or testimonials would not suffice as evidence. 

EDIT2: Clarified ""people""

CMV: Supporters of President Trump should not be mocked or ignored if Democrats want to win elections,1625,797,2017-06-04 23:27:24,"For the record, I grew up in a small, conservative town and many of my relatives, regrettably, voted for Trump. I'm what some on the right might stereotype as a ""liberal coastal elite"" (live in a coastal metropolis, have graduate degree, have worked in media, appreciate science and good grammar).

Since the election, I've seen a subset of liberals - many of my friends included - go on to denounce all Trump supporters as (insert pejorative here) who should not be engaged with on any level because ""you can't reason with stupid"" (I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the gist). This same group often mocks things like blue collar jobs, ""flyover states,"" agricultural work, and those without college degrees. 

To me, this perspective feeds the narrative promulgated by ""the political right"" (RNC, Fox News, etc.) of the Democratic Party/liberals being out of touch/elitist/unable to help the ""common man."" In my mind, it is crucial that we engage with Trump voters in a way that 1) makes them feel heard, and 2) addresses issues important to them. 

Mocking, ignoring, or calling Trump supporters names is counterproductive to the goal of electing progressives/liberals/dems into office. CMV.

edit / point of clarification: many seem to take my argument to mean ""the only way for democrats to win elections is to flip Trump voters"" because I say it is ""crucial"" that we engage them. I concede that this wording supports this conclusion, but what I mean to say is that it is simply *very important* that we engage with Trump supporters.

"CMV: Only registered organ donors should be able to receive an organ transplant, or at the very least, get priority on the transplant waiting list.",1626,399,2016-11-18 22:39:47,"There is an organ shortage in many countries around the world (at least, those where you aren't put on the organ donor list by default and must actively opt-out). I'm a Canadian and in Canada last year, there were only 500 organ donors. A country of 35 million. We have a severe shortage of organ donors, yet so many people that need an organ to live.

A lot of people--in fact, I feel the majority of people--take transplantation for granted. They don't give thought to the fact that, if they get injured or sick and need a transplant, that organ actually needs to come from *somewhere*, *someone*, who has given consent to donate their organ upon death. It's really only those who are unfortunate enough to require an organ, and are sitting on the waiting list, without the privilege of having a living matching donor in their life, that really understand how scarce and valuable a resource organ donation is. Despite receiving the form at each stage of acquiring your driver's license, many people just toss the form into the trash without much thought.

I think there needs to be more awareness, and information, and bluntness, around the issue. We *are* going to die. And we will have no use for our organs. At the very least, pass over your solid organs to one of the many, many people who can get new life from it. Keep your tissues. You can save up to 5 lives.


And so, I think that, as a solution to this issue, only registered organ donors should be allowed to receive an organ transplant, should they fall ill. Or, at the very least, registered organ donors should be given priority above non-registered individuals. Make it common knowledge, make it known, and there will be more people actively considering and signing up to become donors.

Change my view.

**EDIT**: I didn't realize I needed to include a common-sense clause. Those who are ill or who would otherwise not be eligible for organ donation, as well as those under the age of consent, would not be included in this. This is Change My View, not ""try and find superficial loopholes in my argument"". Argue the logic, argue the reasoning, argue the broad statement.",1
CMV: Subreddits shouldn’t ban Redditors for subscribing/participating in other subreddits with opposing viewpoints.,1624,639,2018-03-15 08:15:05,"Here’s the roots: A fellow Redditor was banned from r/TwoXChromosomes for subscribing to and commenting within r/pussypassdenied with the explanation that the Redditor was participating in subreddits with posts and subscribers that are majority misogynistic and against what r/TwoXChromosomes stands for. The ban emphasized that the Redditor could still view r/TwoXChromosomes posts/comments but could not participate actively.

Initially my reaction was frustration which transitioned to disappointment. However, being human, I understand that sometimes my initial reactions are not the most accurate representation of how I feel so I decided to give myself a few days to form a more solid opinion. Here’s what I arrived at:

As people, I don’t think it’s healthy or helpful to put ourselves in a “bubble of safety” by shutting out opposing views. I think banning Redditors for subscribing or participating in other subreddits of opposing nature is essentially treating that opposition as if it doesn’t exist or is not worthy of any attention and I don’t think that accomplishes anything. I think being a participating Redditor on opposing subreddits can bring awareness and intelligent discussion to very difficult topics, and with that comes the possibility to change people’s minds. It can be a source of promoting productive communication to build new perspectives.

Additionally, there are some smaller details that make me think that this should not be a practice among subreddits. If a Redditor is subscribed to a subreddit, that doesn’t innately mean that individual agrees with the views or direction of the subreddit. A Redditor could be seeking to understand how someone of opposition thinks, tracking news/events of an opposing movement, or just want to engage in the guilty pleasure of thinking they are right. I don’t think any of those reasons should mea. they should be banned. If a Redditor is providing commentary in a subreddit, that also does not mean they are supporting they other Redditors or posts made within that subreddit. A Redditor could be trying to challenge other’s views, spread factual knowledge, or just spark production discussion. This type of banning practice feels like the Reddit equivalent of trying to control content and viewership within other media outlets.

Update: I want to thank everyone that provide genuine insight about raids and brigades on Reddit and role of moderators. This was the most valuable information to me. I’m still working on how to award Deltas, and when I do, I will be posting a few.",1
CMV: Flying any form of Confederate Battle Flag or remembering the CSA in any positive light is an incredibly seditious and unpatriotic gesture. It is glorifying the single greatest existential threat to the -United- States of America and its ideals.,1625,545,2017-05-12 02:45:52,"I find the concept of flying any confederate battle flag or CSA national flag to be not only in poor taste, but a seditious action and one of the most unpatriotic displays possible. Far worse than burning the American flag, it is glorifying the bloodiest and most existential threat the USA has ever faced, a force that could actually destroy the Union.  People who fly such a flag are, inadvertently or intentionally, damaging the dignity of the USA and the men who died to prevent the destruction of the ideals of the Union.  In effect, its one of the most unpatriotic actions possible short of direct treason or conspiracy. It is a glorification of sedition.

All attempts at a repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act have been very unsuccessful.

Clinton is not in jail.

""Muslim"" bans have been shot down left and right.

The wall *might* be built, but it's still not clear and it certainly don't be done by Christmas. The tax cuts they are proposing make it even less likely there will be money to build the wall.

The ""swamp"" isn't drained. It's still all corporate and wall street guys and wealthy politicians all around. 

So, what exactly has Trump done that makes him successful as a leader/president for his supporters? Nothing as far as I can tell.

"CMV: If religious people can opt out of a law due to their views, anyone should be allowed to opt out for any reason.",1620,668,2014-07-10 03:43:18,"This is inspired by the Hobby Lobby case that granted religiously-motivated corporations the right to opt out of providing birth control, but ~~it~~ **my argument** also applies to other laws from which religious people are exempt such as peyote prohibition.

It's pretty simple: I believe laws should apply equally to everyone. Anything else is unfair.

This is true regardless of how I feel about any particular law. I want all corporations to supply birth control, but since the Supreme Court has ruled that some don't I believe none should. Since the Hobby Lobby decisions applies to corporations, it's now creating unfair competition because religious companies can save money on insurance.

Laws that affect actual people are even more important, because that's discrimination. In the US your right to practice your religion is constitutionally protected, and so is my right to not practice your religion. Yet if I want to take peyote, the federal government has essentially said I must convert to a religion that allows it.

The only exception I've thought of is the tax-exempt status of religious organizations. Personally I don't think they should be exempt at all, but you can probably make a compelling argument in favor. However, they could just be covered by the same laws as non-profits without requiring their own special tax code.

**EDIT** I repeat: this is not an argument about whether the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the correct side in the Hobby Lobby case. I'm simply arguing a general principle.

**EDIT2** Clarified my first paragraph. Never meant to imply the Hobby Lobby ruling has anything to do with peyote.

"CMV: People are bullies because they have too much self-esteem, not too little",1616,144,2019-11-03 09:50:25,"People always defend bullying by saying ""oh, they just have low self-esteem/have been bullied themselves."" That seems like a load of garbage to me. In my experience, people bully because they feel like they are above the concept of behaving like a decent human being, or at least that's the impression I get. They think it's okay to try to ruin someone else's life  for their own petty entertainment. That screams entitled to me.

I'm saying this as someone who was bullied mercilessly from kindergarten all the way through high school. (LGBTQ and on the spectrum, plus I was in Catholic school until high school, so I was not in a good environment.) I had really low self-worth as a kid (largely because of that), and it never even occurred to me to treat anyone else that way because I understood how much it sucked.

CMV: Cupcakes are vastly overrated,1617,146,2017-04-01 01:37:58,"While the ""Cupcake Craze"" of the early 2010s has lessened, there are still a number of residual holdouts, peddling their ""gourmet"" cupcakes for $5. Here in Chicago, there are Molly's, Sprinkles, Magnolia Bakery, The Cupcake Counter, and countless other self-indulgent cupcake hellholes. They are a symbol of the vast marketing done by Big Cupcake to make us believe that cupcakes are a superior dessert. They sit among the cookie, the cake, and the pie in great American desserts. However, such a statement is a lie and cupcakes, while tasty, are overrated due to (1) inefficient taste delivery, (2) irregular proportions, (3) messiness, and (4) overrated convenience. These 4 points are not exclusive, but cover the basic reasons why cupcakes do not deserve the laud and attention they currently entertain.


Original Position: A cupcake is a cake based dessert that consist of cake batter placed in ridged, paper cups, baked in a specific pan with holes. The cake batter bakes until it overflows the hole and is then frosted/decorated on top before being served. [Image for reference](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&ved=0ahUKEwj7mf2FnoHTAhUB2oMKHck8CXUQjBwIBA&url=https%3A%2F%2Flittlecupcakes.com.au%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F05%2FRed-Velvet.png&psig=AFQjCNF9SOJh_Wcv326CevPTlOPv4z0BRg&ust=1491066591735089). Furthermore, the purpose of a cupcake is to be a more efficient delivery system of cake that can also be individualized.


1. **Inefficient Taste Delivery:** In appearance, a cupcake make sense as a individualized cake. However, the delivery of frosting and cake is inefficient as the structure of a cupcake makes it impossible to taste the cake and frosting evenly. The generally accepted method of biting a cupcake is to pinch the sides of the stump, open one's mouth, and then bite down through the frosting and up through the cake. This supposedly avoids the messiness of grabbing the frosting while still allowing a person to eat the cupcake with his/her hands. Some may bite the frosting or cake first, but those people are fucked in the head. However, the inherent design of a cupcake makes it impossible to deliver an even taste. Instead, the biter distinctly tastes frosting on the roof of his mouth and cake on his tounge. In contrast, other handheld foods, like a sandwich or burger, addresses this issue by encasing the center filling (meat, cheese, condiments, etc) with bread allowing every bite to be even in how the varying tastes are delivered. Some have suggested that you can rip the stump off to put it on top of the cupcake, but this only proves my point that the natural design of a cupcake is flawed and therefore it is overrated as a dessert.


2. **Irregular Proportions:** The inherent design flaw of cupcakes leads to my next point: the irregular proportions and delivery. Cupcakes, especially gourmet ones, have gotten excessive in their proportions of frosting to cake. While cakes normally adhere to a range of frosting depth, current cupcakes can range from .5"" to 3"" of frosting on top. This [picture](http://sugarywinzy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/SugaryWinzy-Spring-Cupcakes-with-Fat-Free-Frosting.jpg) alone shows how ridiculous it can get. It is not standardized in any way can leave you with either too much sweet frosting or too little depending on the one you get. Added to the already 3-5"" stump, you're also looking at possibly an 8"" bite. Unless you can unhinge your jaw, such a is ridiculous. As a result, you will always receive irregular proportions of frosting and cake as you try to tilt the cupcake for a bite. Such proportions show that the cupcake is overrated as a dessert. 


3. **Messiness:** The fucked up proportions of current cupcakes causes the next point: messiness. Cupcakes appear to be a cleaner alternative to your average cake. It's handheld, contained in a paper wrapping, and solid enough to be turned upside now and not collapse or fall apart. However, to anyone who has eaten a cupcake, they understand that the paper wrapping becomes more of a hindrance than a help. Once pulled down, the wrapping either blocks the bite, rubs the bottom of the chin with its dirtiness, or gets completely removed for better cupcake eating. But once removed, the wrapper is now useless waste, much like a plate except that unlike a plate, the wrapper can no longer catch the crumbs from each bite. Instead they fall to the floor or your hand. Additionally, the frosted top, often too big to consume in one bite, will brush the upper lip or nose leaving frosting residue. As a result, you are left with cake crumbs on your hands and frosting on your face. Thus messiness.


4. **Overrated Convenience:** The messiness of the cupcake supports the final point: the overrated convenience of a cupcake. A cupcake is intended to be a more convenient cake. Yet, it leaves you with the same messiness and garbage a slice of cake would. Coupled with the inefficient delivery of fucked up proportions, the convenience of eating a cupcake is made minute if not non-existent. Additionally, if making your own, the individualized nature of each cupcake destroys the convenience of the cupcake. Both baking, frosting, and cleaning are exponentially increased in time and effort so as to render any future convenience worthless.


As it stands, the cupcake should be relegated to novelty desserts that while tasty, are inherently flawed by their design.



So I ask you to change my view on the inferiority of the cupcake and its overrated position in the dessert pantheon.


Edit: Thanks so much for the comments. It's making a slow day go by quick. I'm still of the opinion that cupcakes are vastly overrated despite their inherent design flaws and underwhelming eating experience. But I need to get some work done, so I'll be taking a break from responding. Please continue discussing and fight against Big Cupcake!

"CMV: Hilary Clinton's repeated reminders of her womanhood are, perhaps ironically, counter to the feminist philosophy and is the equivalent of ""playing the race card"".",1618,416,2015-10-14 13:19:13,"During the debate, Hilary Clinton mentioned the fact that she is a woman and specifically indicated that she is the best candidate solely *because* she is a woman several times tonight.

As someone who identifies as a feminist,  I find this condescending and entirely counter productive. That fact that you are a woman no more qualifies you for **any** job than does being a man. The cornerstone of feminism is that a person should be judged not by their sex but by their deeds. By so flippantly using her sex as a qualification for the presidency, Hilary is setting feminism back. 

Further, in 2008, there was strong and very vocal push back to the Obama campaign for ""playing the race card"". Critics, by liberal and conservative, demanded that the Obama campaign never use his race to appeal to voters. Which, at least as far as Obama himself is concerned, led to him literally telling the public not to vote for him only because he is black. 

If at any point Barack Obama *had* said anything akin to what Hilary said tonight, he would have been crucified by the press. The fact that Hilary gets away with this is indicative of an inherent media bias and, once again, is counterproductive to female empowerment. 

I would love to be able to see the value in this tactic but so far I have found none. 

Reddit, Change My View!!!!

**UPDATE**: Sorry for the massive delay in an update, I had been running all this from my phone for the last ~10 hours and I can't edit the op from there.

Anywho:

* First, big shoutouts to /u/PepperoniFire, /u/thatguy3444, and /u/MuaddibMcFly!
All three of you gave very well written, rational critiques to my argument and definitely changed (aspects of) my view. That said, while I *do* now believe Sen. Clinton is justified in her use of this tactic, I still feel quite strongly that it is the wrong course of action with respect to achieving **a perfect** civil society.

* It is quite clear that my definition of feminism is/was far too narrow in this context. As has now been pointed out several times, I'm taking an egalitarian stance when the majority of selfproclaimed feminists are part of the so-called second wave movement. This means, I think, that this debate is far more subjective than I originally thought.

* I want to address a criticism that keeps popping up on this thread and that is that Hilary never **literally** said that being a woman is the sole qualification for her candidacy. 

This is inescapably true. 

However, though I know for a fact that some of you disagree, I think it is and was painfully obvious that Sen. Clinton was strongly implying that her womanhood should be, if not the most important factor, certainly the deciding factor in the democratic primary. Every single sentence that comes out of a politician's mouth is laden with subtext. In fact, more often than not, what is implied and/or what is left unsaid is of far more consequence than what *is* said. I would even go so far as to say that this ""subliminal"" messaging is an integral part of modern public service. To say that Hilary's campaign should only be judged based upon what she **literally** says is to willfully ignore the majority of political discourse in this country.

* Finally, thanks everybody! This blew up waaay more than I thought.",1
CMV: v.reddit links are trash. They make sharing videos annoying and it is annoying to open comments with every gif.,1621,76,2018-07-21 23:46:55,"I love i.reddit links. I know they are links from reddit. Easy to ""Copy image address"" and share it with the group text, Discord, or whatever. 

On top of that, the links are usually atrociously laggy. Sometimes the CSS for some subreddits are just ass for loading in. I don't want to go into the subreddit. I just want to look at the content.

It also makes x-posting a nightmare. There are so many times I see a cross post and it opens up the comments from the original post instead of just the content. For example, there was a x-cross post in /r/math about titled ""Does this belong here?"" Yeah a low quality title, but I was curious. Opening the link and seeing the comments load in *and seeing it was the comment section to a totally different subreddit* is dam annoying. 

I can't Ctrl + click to open only content in new tabs now. I am usually looking at the link types instead of the content.

CMV: The same arguments that justify gay marriage also justify polygamy,1616,349,2017-09-05 22:46:16,"You typically hear some slippery-slope arguments from the anti-gay marriage side, saying that if we allow gay marriage, we'll also allow pedophilia, beastiality, and polygamy. Now the first two I think are ridiculous. I think we can all agree that marriage needs to be between consenting adults, which dismisses pedophilia and beastiality. However, I cannot think of any reason why polygamy should not be included in the umbrella of marriage given arguments for gay marriage.

I particularly remember an episode of Jon Stewart where he responded to this argument by saying ""people aren't born polygamist"". That just isn't true. The definition of being gay is that you are sexually attracted to people of the same sex. You'd be hard pressed to find someone who *hasn't* found themselves sexually attracted to multiple people at the same time. So why shouldn't a group of three or more consenting adults get the privileges of marriage? Why is 2 the magic number?

***

Edit: Copying one of my comments for visibility

This has been a great discussion. I'm gonna try to sum up what my view was and why it changed:

Part 1 of my view was that if you're ok with a gay relationship, you must be ok with a poly relationship (paraphrasing /u/CJGibson). I still believe this holds true.

Part 2 was that if you're ok with a relationship, you must be ok with that relationship being a legally recognized marriage.

Therefore, if you're ok with gay relationships, you must be ok with polygamous marriage.

My issue was in part 2. A socially accepted relationship does not necessarily mean it should be a legally recognized marriage. As pointed out by /u/tbdabbholm and /u/GnosticGnome and others, the structure of marriage works best with 2 people, from a legal and practical standpoint. We already have this established structure as the institution of marriage. That being said, a relationship between a gay couple should be able to advance to marriage status because they should have the same right to access the benefits of marriage as a straight couple. However, since poly relationships have more than 2 people, they are incompatible with the already established institution of marriage, so it should not be legal.",1
"CMV: The (mostly US) way of writing a date ""month/day/year"" is inferior to writing the date as ""day/month/year"" and should be changed nationwide.",1609,508,2018-05-18 02:55:51,"While both systems may seem completely arbitrary, I believe the day/month/year (DMY) or year/month/day (YMD) follows the logical rules of ascending/descending order and therefore is more intuitive to a person not familiar with either system. Furthermore, time is written in either ascending or descending order (seconds/minutes/hours) and it makes little sense to write date in a different way. Thus, I believe that the DMY is superior to the MDY for these reasons.

Why it should be changed nationwide:

The usage of the MDY system in in the minority and it only causes confusion across countries. Unlike imperial units, which, if stated as imperial units, can be converted to metric units (and vice versa), the date is usually just written as three numbers separeted by a period/slash and therefore you have literally no way telling which way it is written in (except for cases that one number is larger than 12, or when the month is written as a word with letters, not as a number). It would not be the first time a crucial mistake happened somewhere in the world that caused unnecessary hassle because of the way some people write dates. 

I believe that unlike imperial vs metric units, this would actually require little costs compared to the benefits and since the inferior system is also the minority, the DMY system should be implemented across all the states that use the MDY system.

CMV: You cannot take credit away from people in history due to what was socially acceptable in their time being different from what it is now,1610,274,2018-03-27 21:57:20,"You often here about famous people in History being looked down upon due to behavior that would be socially acceptable in their time, but is not acceptable in our modern time. 

There are many examples of people getting flak for this. One example of this would be with some of the founder fathers of the United States, Christopher Columbus, etc. Some people see it disgraceful that they owned slaves, and should be decredited because we think of slavery as a horrific act today. 

The problem with this is, you cannot judge a person based on the societies current morals. Some things we consider immoral today (like slavery) are a completely normal part of society for most of history. 

Here is one way of thinking about it: Imagine that if in the year 2100, the societal morals have changed. In their society, ""owning"" pets is cruel and should be looked down upon. Does that make you a bad person for currently owning a pet now? Obviously not, since it is something that is perfectly acceptable by our standards today.

"I believe that reactionary responses to terrorist acts e.g. no bags at 2014 Boston Marathon are unnecessary, mostly ineffective and send a message that terrorism is effective. CMV",1608,316,2014-03-11 01:34:15,"I'm a lifelong resident of Massachusetts living in the Boston area. Last March, the Boston Marathon was the target of terrorist act that left more than 200 injured and 3 dead. This year, the announcement was made that there would be no bags allowed into certain areas along the route and runners would not be allowed to keep bags at the finish line, nor carry them on their person. This notably hamstrung the efforts of service members planning the yearly Tough Ruck, where they carry the packs of fallen soldiers for the entire marathon.

Hearing this news, I immediately thought, do the organizers not realize that they are doing the exact thing that the horrible individuals that perpetrate these acts want them to do? They want us to always be in fear, to associate fear with them.  Wouldn't a better response be for all of us to recognize that we live in a free society, but that freedom comes with a price, often the highest price of all. To proudly continue our tradition in the face of those who would attempt to sow fear and chaos. It sends a message that we are strong, enriched by the rational conclusion that, while we will never be 100% safe, we can be 100% free. But to sacrifice that, for some perceived security, is folly. Change my view.

I want to qualify that I was extremely lucky to not be personally impacted by the events of last year. I feel sadness for every family irreparably changed by that day, and I can't imagine what they had to go through. I would be especially interested in the view of those that have been more deeply/personally affected by this and other tragedies if that informed your viewpoint. ",1
"CMV: Just as hetero men are ""held responsible"" for women's body image issues, hetero women should be ""held responsible"" for men's self-destructive and macho behaviour",1602,358,2016-04-19 16:44:56,"First up, I'm not suggesting any kind of legal or otherwise tangible accountability.  I mean within the discourse, women's romantic preferences should be acknowledged as a contributing factor to the problem of men's macho behaviour.

Basically, it seems to me that in discussions about the female body image crisis men's sexual preferences for skinny and unrealistic female bodies are named as a contributing factor.

It seems to me that the reasoning goes something like: ""Women are starving themselves because they think (rightly or wrongly) that that's what men want""

Well, it seems to me that men are suffering in another area of life due to their perception of what women want: road traffic deaths/injuries.

The [World Health Organisation states](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs358/en/) that:

>From a young age, males are more likely to be involved in road traffic crashes than females. About three-quarters (73%) of all road traffic deaths occur among men. Among young drivers, young males under the age of 25 years are almost 3 times as likely to be killed in a car crash as young females.

I don't think it's controversial to deduce that driving dangerously is usually an act of bravado which in itself is a manifestation of the ""macho"" culture that many young men consider is essential to making themselves appealing to the opposite sex.

Potential counterarguments:

* **""Well, women aren't actually impressed by or attracted to aggressive or macho behaviour""** -- Yeah, well some are.  Just like some men are attracted to skinny girls.  But the problem is that each gender has a warped sense of what the other wants.  So if women's misguided belief that they need to look a certain way is pinned on men, then men's misguided belief that they need to *behave* a certain way should be pinned on ~~men~~ women.

* **""Women aren't starving themselves for men, they're chasing body image ideals to impress other women""** -- I've never bought this argument (which I've also seen deployed in discussions about why women wear make-up, expensive clothes etc).  Sure, maybe consciously a lot of women want to look ""good"" to impress other women.  But I would argue that their entire conception of ""what looks good"" and ""what is feminine"" is intrinsically informed by what men find attractive.  Similarly with why men drive fast and generally act like macho idiots.  A group of lads might be hooning around the streets of your local town on a Saturday night without a woman in the car to impress, but the driver is displaying braggadocio to the other men in order to establish himself as the dominant member of the group.  His method of attempting to display dominance (aggressive driving, macho behaviour) is informed by what he thinks is appealing to women.

So what do I want?

As I said in the first paragraph, I'm not saying we should scorn women for this in any tangible way.  I'm simply saying that it should be acknowledged as a part of the problem of young male aggression in the way that male sexual preferences are frequently identified as a part of the body image problem among women.  In recent years, I think many men would have experienced a backlash from ""female-body-ideal-non-conforming"" women when commenting on the attractiveness of a 
""female-body-ideal-**conforming**"" woman.  

Women who express attraction to or admiration for men engaging in dangerous macho behaviour should face the same public disapproval in the same way that men who like ""skinny"" women do.

Just as men are being ""educated"" through the public discourse on embracing ""real women"" (ie with curves and ""female-body-ideal-non-conforming"" body types), women should be ""educated"" through public discourse on embracing men who display ""male-behavioural-ideal-non-conforming"" behaviours.

CMV: Allowing people to contract sexual labor could eliminate some of the ambiguity that has led to the #MeToo movement while allowing women to benefit economically from the demand for sex with females,1601,509,2020-02-10 21:36:51,"This is an attempt to regulate the informal exchange of sexual  labor and economic goods that lies at the heart of the #MeToo movement. This idea does not concern rape, sexual assault, or any  non-consensual form of violence. It will primarily deal with charges of  sexual harassment perpetrated by men against women.

**IDEA STARTS HERE:**

The goal of the Me Too movement to totally separate sexual attraction  from  employment is a total fantasy.  As it stands now, there is a shadow  economy in which men systematically extort women’s sexual labor. **Changing  the laws around contracting sexual labor could eliminate some of the  ambiguity that has led to the Me Too movement while allowing  women to  benefit economically from the demand for sex with females.**

Here are the points of my argument:

1. Romantic relationships happen all the time in the workplace. These relationships affect employment decisions. *This will not change* and any attempts to regulate these romantic relationships will push them further into the shadows, further disempowering women.
2. The  key is to distinguish romantic relationships from sexual relationships.  There is overlap, but these relationships are different. My argument  deals with sexual relationships, which may or may not be romantic  relationships.
3. Men  currently hold a disproportionate share of global capital and power.  There is a greater demand in the market for sex with females. Monetizing  sexual labor would allow women to benefit financially from this market  reality. This would be true women's empowerment.

**ALLOW WOMEN TO BENEFIT FROM THIS ECONOMIC REALITY.**  If men like Harvey Weinstein are able to write into the contract that  they expect to have sex with the actresses they hire, then women are  able to make an informed decision about whether or not they want to work  with him. Women can also sue for uncompensated labor if her boss  attempts to sleep with her.

As  I stated before, this post does not apply to rape, sexual assault, or  any other non-consensual form of abuse. This argument is an attempt to  regulate the informal exchange of sexual labor and economic goods that  lies at the heart of the #MeToo movement.

Edit: A clarification from: u/[Orwellian1](https://www.reddit.com/user/Orwellian1/)3:

""What op is suggesting is the  instant a sexual encounter takes place, there would be *at minimum* civil liability for unpaid labor. There would be no ""consent"" defense.""""

CMV: Parents who allow their children to become morbidly obese at a young age should be subjected to some sort of intervention or consequences.,1600,158,2020-09-02 22:19:34,"I used to work in public schools and the percentage of obese children is both staggering and disheartening. I consider severe childhood obesity to be a form of physical abuse when it's the result of parental negligence. Parents that put their kids into lifelong health risks should have consequences or be forced to accept some form of external support.

What could potentially change my view would be financial circumstances - I understand that many low-income families rely on fast food and low nutrition meals because they're more affordable, but seeing elementary school kids with severe diabetes and being so overweight they can barely walk down the hallway is really difficult to accept. There are resources and options for low-income families to not just have McDonald's and pizza every day. 

I think it ultimately comes down to negligence - it's easier for parents to let their kids constantly eat junk food and drink soda but they often don't understand the long-term health damage that's being done.",1

I think I am speaking for the vast majority of people who created their oldest and sometimes only account with a name that is either really stupid, irrelevant or reveals personal information when I say we should be able to change our name at least one time even if it comes at a small fee. I think that would be a beneficial alternative to Reddit Gold.  This isn’t to suggest that you *have* to pay for it. I would prefer having it be completely free, just limited in how frequent one could change it. 

To combat the issue of maintaining a history that can be traced to you, I would suggest having any and every post or comment update accordingly when you decide to change your name. 

Take this for example, the name of my main account that is over 6 years old is my full IRL name. I was a young lurker who didn’t fully understand much of what Reddit was about when I created it and it’s a pain in the ass having to replicate an identical feed with access to certain subs where applications had to be reviewed in order to post to the given sub. For example, being ‘whitelisted’ on r/streetwear requires a google form including 15 unique pictures to be reviewed so one can post a WDYWT(What did you wear today) post. There are a plethora of other instances similar to this on a variety of different subs such that simply being able to keep the main account but changing the name would completely circumvent this issue.

However, seeing that I have little to no experience with  programming or any substancial technical knoweldge in regards to software development, I feel it's safe to say I would be unaware of any potential implications changing your 'u/'  would bring as far as preserving long term identity or general experience. None the less, I still hold this view. Why should I change it?",1

I realize the Daily Show and Colbert Report aren't exactly hard news shows but I do watch both of those consistently, I listen to npr and economics podcasts, I read articles online that I can find to educate myself but I *still* feel like unless I'm spending hours a day researching, I have no idea what I'm talking about and shouldn't have arguing in favor of anything more complex than gay marriage (which doesn't even get debated).

TL;DR - I feel like unless I spend hours a day researching politics and economics, I'm not qualified enough to have a strong political opinion and I have no right to argue for a position.  Please CMV so I don't feel like an idiot.

CMV: I should not pay extra towards my student loans because the next US President might forgive student loan debt.,1591,442,2019-11-12 16:34:47,"Edit 1: Everyone seems to think I'm suggesting I just ignore the loan. I should have been clearer. I **certainly** will be paying **at least** the minimum payment. That would pay back the loan over 10 years. I'm considering whether I should pay the loan over 10 years or 1 year.

&#x200B;

Original Post:
I have about about $20,000 in loans at a fixed interest rate of 4.5%. I have the income to completely pay them within a year, however if the next newly elected US President implements broad student loan forgiveness, wouldn't that be a waste of my money?

Elizabeth Warren proposes mass student loan forgiveness conditional on income. Warren proposes forgiving up to $50,000 in federal student loans for all borrowers with a household income of $100,000 or less, and partial forgiveness to those up to $250,000.

Bernie Sanders proposes the cancelation of all outstanding U.S. student loans, regardless of borrowers’ income levels.

I put my personal situation for context, but the real CMV is for the indebted student in general. Shouldn't we only pay the minimum payment as long as there is the possibility that the debt will be canceled?

&#x200B;

Edit 2:

Essentially, it's FOMO. I want to avoid the situation in which I pay all my loans off and then broad student loan forgiveness is subsequently passed.

Also, I mentioned this in a comment- student loan interest payment is tax deductible, so my real interest rate is about 3%. That's about the same as inflation here in California. In real dollars, it costs me almost nothing to pay only the minimums.

&#x200B;

Edit 3:

Well, I've been convinced that the likelihood that broad student loan forgiveness is passed is near infinitesimal. As my mind has been changed, I won't factor in loan forgiveness into my personal finance plan.

However as many pointed out, since my interest rate is so low, it can make financial to pay the minimums and invest the difference in low fee ETFs for example. I might as well, I have a high risk tolerance. I already max my 401k match, ROTH, and have leftovers for the occasional r/wallstreetbets YOLO.

Also, I just want to highlight u/carlko20's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/dv788v/cmv_i_should_not_pay_extra_towards_my_student/f7bxur1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) about the economics of Sanders' plan. Incredible depth.

>These plans may not directly/obviously affect how you would invest, but they would kill the value of many stocks including your ETFs(who they would affect), divert our financial activity to other countries, and could even end up net costing us tax revenue.

&#x200B;

Finally, to the countless people saying things like:

>Why not pay what you owe because you agreed to pay it, you freeloading parasite?

and

>""Forgive""? You misspelled ""Rob the taxpayer to pay off a debt which you willingly, knowingly incurred.""

**OK Boomer.** But in all seriousness, I understand your feelings. I'm neither advocating for or against government debt forgiveness. In fact, because I'm just starting my high paying career, student loan forgiveness would be a net loss! I already pay 40k in taxes... I'd pay **WAY** more in taxes (income and capital gains) in the long run paying for other people's loans! But if it's going to go through, I'd rather have my loans forgiven so I'm not completely on the losing end of the deal.

Look, neither Sanders or Warren's plan is how I'd ameliorate the student debt crisis. Personally, I would implement subsidized [Income Share Agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_share_agreement). People would continue to pay their current loans if they choose to, but if a person feels it is in their best interest, their tuition or loan will be fully payed. In exchange, they agree to pay back a percentage of their income for a fixed number of years. For example, 10% of their income for 10 years. The agreement parameters can be influenced by income, net worth, occupation, degree, major, etc...

This would allow people to get out of crushing debt, to reenter the economy (consumption), and invest in themselves. In theory, some people will end up paying more than they needed to, and some people will be a net loss- but either way they are back in the economy. Which is good for all of us. Most importantly, it feels more ""fair"". ISAs would prevent people like me from taking advantage of the program. It's not rational for me to sign an agreement to garnish my wages.

It seems that one reason this post has gained traction is that people recognize the incongruity of a program that incentivizes a person like me to postpone their additional debt payments in order to have them forgiven.",1
"CMV: While understandable, women who state ""I'm scared and uncomfortable around men after my rape"" should also be okay with people who state ""I'm scared and uncomfortable around black people since my rape/robbery/etc"".",1589,623,2018-05-23 13:48:37,"I'm truly interested in people changing my mind. This is something that has been going over in my mind for a while now.


If a woman states she's uncomfortable around men after a rape, everybody (myself included) is completely accepting of that statement, and provide sympathy for her obvious trauma. Certain haircuts, cologne etc. may make this worse. However, I have seen people who have been robbed/raped by black people who also state that they're uncomfortable around those people, as it trudges up painful memories. Every time that's stated, the comments (or people nearby) state how that's incorrect, that's racist, you can't say that etc. They often state how you can't judge the race based upon the few, and while I agree, that also pertains to the example with women feeling scared by men. I don't see how these two situations are really that different. 

I'm truly curious about my mind being changed. Would love some feedback. Thanks.

EDIT: I should clarify. By ""uncomfortable"" I mean essentially triggers, PTSD in a way. Not just uneasiness. I'm not saying that black people are more prone to crime at all, simply that seeing somebody that reminds you of the attacker could trigger a PTSD attack.",1
"CMV: Beginning in high school, American students should choose one of two paths: the University path or the Trade path.",1584,259,2018-01-05 00:25:37,"I am a high school math teacher at an urban public high school. In my years of teaching, I have noticed that there is a clear distinction between students who plan to go to a college or university after high school and those who do not. I believe that much of the high school curriculum is almost completely useless for students who do not plan to attend college. I am a college graduate and even currently working on my Master's degree, so I understand that the knowledge and skills acquired in high school courses will be beneficial to those students going to college. However, students who plan on entering the workforce or attending a trade school straight out of high school have little to no use for much of what we teach.

This system would allow students who want to go to college to choose the path that includes curriculum very similar to what it already is. Students choosing the Trade path would take courses that teach basic mechanical skills, technical skills, etc. that are needed for a wide variety of trade professions. 

Our current education system was built around preparing students for college, but the reality is that many do not attend college, and they do not need to. There are countless professions that are crucial to the way our society works that do not require a college degree (i.e., construction workers, electricians, plumbers, truck drivers...the list goes on and on), and those professions should not be viewed as lesser than their degree-requiring counterparts. Students should not be admonished for not wanting to attend college.

I predict that the main argument against this notion is that 15-year-olds often do not know what they want to do with their lives, and asking them to make such an important decision would not be wise. I agree that they might not know exactly what they want to do, but the vast majority know if they want to attend college or not by that age. And of course students could change paths, within reason, if they so chose. It wouldn't be something that sets their futures in stone, but something that would allow them to benefit from their education much more than many do currently.

EDIT: With so many comments, I cannot reply to them all, so I want to clarify a few things here that seem to be common elements among what people are saying:

1. I do NOT believe that we should force children to make a permanent decision about the rest of their lives at age 14. A very important part of my argument is that children should be allowed to switch paths (within reason of course), without delaying their degree.

2. Somewhat related to #1 above, there would be some common courses between the paths (however many paths there would be). Students should still be required to take basic math, science, languages, etc., as these teach important skills that people need regardless of their career path.

3. Apparently I have said something to make some people believe that I should not be a teacher because I don't know what education really means. For me, one of the most important parts of education is that students learn to think critically and make logical decisions. I tell my students nearly every day that the problem-solving skills they learn in my math class will carry them much further than the formulas they learn. But I would argue that these problem-solving skills can ALSO be learned in classes that simultaneously give them the knowledge and skills needed to pursue a particular path in life.

CMV: I believe that Children should be given mandatory vaccinations if their body is labeled as healthy enough to do so.,1579,623,2017-07-12 15:09:46,"To go into more detail, I am of the belief that vaccinations should not be the parents choice for their children, but rather should be mandatory.

CMV: Fear of girls getting abused is a poor excuse for opposing gender inclusive public restrooms,1580,1056,2019-03-07 03:36:20,"One of the counter arguments to non gender specific restrooms or allowing trans people to use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify is that a male pedophile can follow a little girl into the restroom under the guise of identifying as female and then molest her. My arguments against that logic as as follows.

1.  Signs don't stop determined criminals.  Most mass shootings happen in places with a gun free zone sign on the door that did nothing to stop the murderer. A ""Ladies"" restroom sign would be just as ineffective at stopping a molester.

2.  Nothing is stopping you from checking on your daughter. In this example, a dad is at a store with his young daughter who needs to use the restroom. He walks her to the restroom and a ""man"" follows her in. He can't say anything about it because if that person could just say they identify as a woman and that's why they were using that restroom when in reality they were a molester. My response to this is in that particular example follow that person into the restroom and make sure your daughter is ok. In a world where anyone can go to any restroom, so can you. 

3.  Boys get molested too. Nothing is stopping a male pedophile from following a boy into the restroom today, but that doesn't seem to get as much concern as the male pedophile in the girls room.  Reinforcing gendered restrooms would do nothing to help boys safety. 

For parents concerned about the safety of their child in a public restroom, eliminating gender segregation of restrooms would be the best outcome. Therefore a mother could take her young son to the bathroom as could a father and daughter so they could be supervised in case someone wanted to do them harm.  To argue otherwise is either deliberate or unconscious transphobia. 

Edit:  I've seen some good replies so far and awarded a delta. I'm willing to award more depending on the replies. I would say I have yet to see a real good counterargument to my 3rd point. I've you ever seen the documentary ""Red Pill"" there's a decent point that some Men's Rights Advocates make about the disposabilty of men. Basically it's the societal and cultural reason that only men are eligible for the draft in the US, the whole women and children first thing in a disaster, and the fact that nearly all workplace fatalities are men. If we really care about people getting sexually assaulted in bathrooms let's take steps to safeguard all people not just women and girls. Just recently in my home town, a man was arrested for filming people in a Wal-Mart men's bathroom. While some comments in the news story were those of shock and sympathy for the victims there were a lot more jokes and minimizing than there would have been had this been a man spying in women. ",1
"CMV: Trans-women are trans-women, not women.",1581,1187,2018-06-22 06:34:56,"Hey, everyone. Thanks for committing to this subreddit and healthily (for most part) challenging people's views.

I'm a devoted leftist, before I go any further, and I want to state that I'm coming forward with this view from a progressive POV; I believe transphobia should be fully addressed in societies.

I also, in the very same vantage, believe that stating ""trans-women are women"" is not biologically true. I have seen these statements on a variety of websites and any kind of questioning, even in its most mild form, is viewed as ""TERF"" behavior, meaning that it is a form of radical feminism that excludes trans-women. I worry that healthy debate about these views are quickly shut down and seen as an assault of sorts.

From my understanding, sex is determined by your very DNA and that there are thousands of marked differences between men and women. To assert that trans-women are just like cis-women appears, to me, simply false. I don't think it is fatally ""deterministic"" to state that there is a marked difference between the social and biological experiences of a trans-woman and a cis-woman.

CMV: The presidential primary should be randomized with states being picked at random when they will hold there election.,1581,242,2020-01-11 11:31:17,"The states that vote earlier have a wider selection of candidates and focus the race on the candidates they choose. Later states may not even have a choice or only one alternative with most candidates already dropping out. 

The earlier states have a lot more face to face time with the candidates. Because of this, early states have there issues brought to the forefront as issues of debate and pandering.

States that are earlier in the race see more revenue from ad dollars. While this should not be a major reason it is a benefit that can have a value assigned to it. 

Making the primary random lets other citizens focus the race on potentially different candidates, it will spread the ad dollars around and let the candidates focus on other states issues rather than the first few states every four years.

If any of the states that are currently first are unhappy with the new random order and try to hold their election early. The party can take away there delegates like they do currently. This may lead to them not having representation for one election year but will level the playing field for the other states. 

I would use a process the draft uses. Two buckets mixing capsules. One contains states names, the other the election dates is to be held. Draw a state, draw a date and that’s when it will be held for that year. You could draw these at any time after the previous election 3 years or as soon as a year.

The system, as is, is killing Americans. Corn subsidies are crazy high because of pandering to Iowa as it's first. Corn subsidies have lead to an oversupply and the use of corn syrup in so many foods and beverages. This had lead to the obesity epidemic in America and more and more around the world. Obesity leads to diabetes and depression. These diseases lead to premature death in a variety of ways, ad a result American life expectancy is decreasing!!! As because Iowa always goes first.",1
CMV: Harvard's removal of Sullivan (Weinstein's ex-lawyer) from a dean's post is wrong,1581,255,2019-05-13 16:19:35,"abc News article: [Harvey Weinstein's ex-lawyer loses position at Harvard despite bowing out of case](https://abcnews.go.com/US/harvey-weinsteins-lawyer-loses-position-harvard-bowing-case/story?id=62985775)

TLDR: Harvard decided not to renew Ron Sullivan's position as a faculty dean because students were upset he represented Weinstein.

Nobody likes Harvey Weinstein, that's understandable. You can think he's disgusting, you can think he's a criminal and you would be justified.

However, Ron Sullivan is a lawyer. Lawyers have to defend people and those people often are criminals, I don't see the issue with it.

A lawyer that doesn't want to defend criminals is just as useless as a doctor that only wants to work with healthy people.

If Harvard law school students can't see that then, maybe, they applied to the wrong faculty? I am not sure what to think about Harvard's admission committee if the majority of the law school students that they admitted is uneasy with people who defend criminals.

If students don't like that lawyers have to defend people they may despise then students absolutely need the presence of someone like Sullivan to explain them what it means to be a lawyer. It's ridiculous that a university like Harvard caves in to the (irrational) demands of a bunch of angry students.

Also, disclaimer: Harvard's actions don't affect me in any way, I don't even live in the US, I just stumbled upon this article and I found it so ridiculous that I initially thought I was reading satire.

Am I missing something important that justifies Harvard's actions?

*Edit:* messed up link

*Edit2:* u/PsychicFoxWithSpoons already changed my view. Sullivan didn't lose his position exclusively because of this case, he was honestly a shit dean that was accused of misconduct by more than half the resident tutors.

CMV Suicide should be legal,1574,462,2019-05-03 09:15:27,"I know I'm probably gonna get a lot of hate for this but realistically I don't fully understand why it isn't. None of us ever really chose to be alive yet by law we're required to maintain an existence we never asked for. I'm not suicidal, I'm just genuinely confused why there isn't more discussion about this. Suicide is such a touchy subject, and we've all been lead to believe that it's never the answer even though we don't even know how or why we are alive to start with. Does it make sense to make someone keep something they never wanted in the first place? I know it's more complicated than that, but I feel like there needs to be a real discussion about this.

Edit: I know there's loads of arguments to either side of this debate and honestly I hate arguing I just really felt like there needed to be a discussion about this. The media and all of us are so brain washed in a sense to fear death and things surrounding it rather than understand that its not all bad.

CMV: Abuse doesn't excuse abusing others.,1574,113,2019-04-05 16:36:25,"In English class today (I'm 18 if that gives some perspective) we watched a documentary about (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_(feral_child)) which is a fairly horrific case of child abuse. In it; after the trial for the mother concludes, she is found innocent on the basis of also being abused by the father of the girl. I'll spare most of the details because It's just the example that started the debate. I'd voiced that I didn't think that was fair because the abuse lasted over 10 years but I was met with alot of backlash from my classmates(My school is heavily left-wing if that adds and context) but none of them would go further with why they felt so strongly she was innocent. I talked with a few friends about it after and got a few reasons but none of them seemed very persuasive;
 firstly they talked about given it happened in the 60s and the  criminality of domestic abuse aswel as the helpfulness of police in domestic abuse cases in that time was poor so made it impossible for her to go to the police but given the case involved serious child abuse I don't think it's a reasonable outlook that she would honestly believe the police wouldn't act.

their second point and third point(I'll put them together because neither felt very good) was that: 
a) women couldn't be self sustaining during the 60s so any form of divorce was equal to suicide 
b) she became complacent to the abuse
but for example if you were poor and your boss killed someone; reporting them would result in poverty but it doesn't give you legal or moral grounds to be complicit & and if becoming complacent of apathetic to others due to unfortunate circumstance were a valid reason for abusing others then most abuses would be considered innocent.

Last but not least;
""She must of been paranoid of deranged from the abuse."" despite the case not giving her any leeway in terms of mentally illness claims and her neighbors all said she seemed completely mentally stable ""she hid it due to tough stance on the mentally impaired/ill"" then how could she be exempt on the basis of an illness she never showed.

I'm not trying to redo the whole debate it's just everyone I know seemed extremely adamant that no matter the circumstance if you are being abused it isn't your fault if you abuse others. I understand most of the people I'm around are very liberal but I wasn't really able to get a genuine reason why someone of automatically innocent other then ""They just are."" I'm writing this because I'm curious why being abused would be seem different to other trauma or abuse given that no one I know argued in favour of: (https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/cycle-of-child-sexual-abuse-links-between-being-a-victim-and-becoming-a-perpetrator/A98434C25DB8619FB8F1E8654B651A88) sexual abuse cycles when it came out a few months prior.
Please don't focus too much on the semantics of the case as I'm mainly interested in the philosophy/politics of the attitude itself.

TL;DR: what makes being abused(but not under a constant duress) a valid moral/legal motivation for doing bad things?

edit 1: when I said ""very left wing"" I meant they lean more into collective responsibility rather than personal. Also I won't change title but 'Justification' is probably a more accurate wording that 'excuse' of what I was trying to argue.",1
CMV: if your friend texts while driving you should pressure them to stop,1571,146,2019-02-09 02:49:18,"Wikipedia gives the overall impression that it's as bad or worse than driving while intoxicated. 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texting\_while\_driving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texting_while_driving)  


One time in college my housemate came home from a work shift and gleefully mentioned that he had driven home drunk. Everyone within earshot replied with unambiguous condemnation.

If your friend admits that they constantly text while driving, it is an underreaction to not express strong disapproval. For comparison, think of what reaction is appropriate if you find out that someone is stealing bikes or scamming old people on craigslist or abusing their pets or knowingly transmitting STDs--hopefully one wouldn't just laugh and forget about it.

If you text and drive, you might kill or paralyze a kid that you otherwise wouldn't have. This should be treated as high risk and morally reprehensible behavior. We don't have to just sheepishly accept that everyone does it, like leaving out dirty dishes or eating too much sugar.

Things that might change my view include alternate calculations of risk vs reward, alternate interpretations responsibility, evidence that peer-pressure does not work well for norm enforcement, evidence of unintended consequences, reasons why I should shift emphasis from ""don't harm innocents"" to ""don't put yourself at legal risk"", or reasons why I should save my breath for something more important.

(Background: yesterday it occurred to me that I don't know how frequently I interact with people who have caused auto fatalities. It's not something that ever comes up in conversation. I guess those people just walk around with an emotional albatross for the rest of their life, and this is part of their punishment. Seems like the punishment does not lead to much deterrence though. Hence the need to be more proactive about disincentivizing bad behavior.)",1
CMV: Punching Nazis is bad,1576,1626,2018-09-07 18:34:22,"Inspired by [this comment section.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/9dm8yf/jury_fines_man_1_for_punching_charlottesville/) Basically, a Nazi got punched, and the puncher was convicted and ordered to pay a $1 fine. So the jury agreed they were definitely guilty, but did not want to punish the puncher anyway.

I find the glee so many redditors express in that post pretty discouraging. I am by no means defending Nazis, but cheering at violence doesn't sit right with me for a couple of reasons.

1. It normalizes using violence against people you disagree with. It normalizes depriving other groups of their rights (Ironically, this is exactly what the Nazis want to accomplish). And it makes you the kind of person who will cheer at human misery, as long as it's the out group suffering. It poisons you as a person.

2. Look at the logical consequences of this decision. People are cheering at the message ""You can get away with punching Nazis. The law won't touch you."" But the flip side of that is the message ""The law won't protect you"" being sent to extremists, along with ""Look at how the left is cheering, are these attacks going to increase?"" If this Nazi, or someone like him, gets attacked again, and shoots and kills the attacker, they have a *very* ironclad case for self defence. They can point to this decision and how many people cheered and say they had very good reason to believe their attacker was above the law and they were afraid for their life. And even if you don't accept that excuse, you really want to leave that decision to a jury, where a single person sympathizing or having reasonable doubts is enough to let them get away with murder? And the thing is, it arguably *isn't* murder. They really do have good reason to believe the law will not protect them.

The law isn't only there to protect people you like. It's there to protect everyone. And if you single out any group and deprive them of the protections you afford everyone else, you *really* can't complain if they hurt someone else. But the kind of person who cheers at Nazis getting punched is also exactly the kind of person who will be outraged if a Nazi punches someone else.

Now. By all means. Please do help me see this in a different light. I'm European and pretty left wing. I'm not exactly happy to find myself standing up for the rights of Nazis. This all happened in the US, so I may be missing subtleties, or lacking perspective. If you think there are good reasons to view this court decision in a positive light, or more generally why it's ok to break the law as long as the victims are extremists, please do try to persuade me.

CMV: Women have it easier when it comes to dating/relationships than men.,1571,892,2019-02-01 12:43:11,"I feel like with online dating and all that jazz, it makes dating far easier for women. If you compared a man and a woman of roughly the same attractiveness level, the woman would most likely receive far more matches.

&#x200B;

Even in real life, it seems like women have it easier. Although the dynamic seems to be changing slightly in terms of who is supposed to ask who out, it seems as if a man typically has to go to far more effort to pursue a relationship, whilst a woman will usually be on the receiving end. In essence, it feels like guys are usually the ones to ""get rejected"" whilst women get to do the ""rejecting"".

&#x200B;

Yes, I won't deny that while women may get more opportunities, some of the opportunities might be of lower quality (such as a guy only out for sex, ONS with fake intentions, etc). But I still feel like the average shy girl/introverted girl has a much better shot than a guy in the same position.

CMV: NBA commentators and analysts spend too much time speculating about the personal lives of the players,1557,91,2019-05-10 20:48:05,"I get that it’s the playoffs and that the off season is approaching, but there is quite a bit of coverage in the NBA that spends a significant chunk of time speculating about the psyche or psychological state of the players with little legitimacy. I noticed this most with the reactions to Kyrie Irving after the Celtics recent loss to the Bucks. Kyrie had probably the worse 3 games of his career at the worst possible time and the Buck played exceptionally but the main topic of conversation on espn is about Kyrie’s presumably flawed character. The Lakers negotiations with Ty Lue fall flat and the speculation is about how this is an indication of Lebron James supposedly self evident desire to force his coach into the organization. The Sixers loose and we talk about Embiids maturity levels. 

I cant exactly remember or imagine what commentary was like in the 80s and 90s but I want to say that commentator spent less time making claims about players psychological states than they do now. I understand that players have more of a voice and are more visible than previous eras and that this has contributed to more of an interest in their personal lives but I feel like espn in particular is more similar to something like TMZ than traditional sports analysis. 

I get that ratings are a factor and sensationalism has the potential to increase these numbers, but considering the advanced metrics available there could easily be more interesting and in-depth commentary and analysis of the game and the players performances. 

I’m not sure if this is a current trend with all sports but It feels like commentary is becoming too psychoanalytical and getting farther away from the game itself.",1
"CMV: Laws restricting the sale of alcohol, dancing, etc. on Easter have no place in a modern secular country",1556,309,2015-04-03 20:57:38,"Pretty much says it in the title.

Such laws are common in otherwise secular countries, perhaps most famously the *tanzverbot* in Germany.

When it comes to special laws on Sunday, I disagree, but I do see the rationale in providing for laws for a common weekly day of rest, and Sunday is as good as any other.  However, when it comes to Easter, there is no rationale other than trying to forcibly impose Christian observances on the wider population, and this has no place in a secular country.  CMV

CMV: Liberal Americans are justified to be angry with Trump supporters and to worry about the future,1554,1071,2017-07-27 23:06:25,"Since the election, there's been various statistics showing that liberals are more pessimistic about the country's future and dislike Trump and many of his supporters. Since the shooting last month (iirc), it's become popular (and easy) to say that liberals should be nicer and more open minded but I believe they would be naive not to worry about Republicans and very passive not to be angry with Republican voters.

Firstly, Republicans have disproportionately high political power. Due to them living in smaller States and rural areas, their votes matter more than those in cities and states like California or New York in the Senate and presidential elections. This means they can impose their ideas on the majority of people even if they are unpopular among the majority (e.g. Trump). This is undemocratic and worrying given their behaviour.

Second, Republicans policies and politicians are genuinely dangerous. Republican policies on health care and government support will almost certainly hurt people and even cost lives. Most political parties wouldn't consider policies as extreme as theirs but they are special in how far right wing they are. Their indifference to climate change, poverty, poor healthcare and inequality means that their policies will actually make America and the world worse. It'd be stupid for liberals to be ok with this. Plus despite Obamacare disproportionately helping Trump supporters, they still want it dismantled just because they see it as a 'win'. How can you not fear someone who hates you so much, they're willing to suffer just to 'beat' you?

Also, Trump and many other Republican politicians show erratic and/or ammoral behaviour that should be concerning to people. Even mainstream Republicans like McConnel regularly behave appallingly.

Thirdly, Republicans cannot be reasoned with. As can be seen by their contempt for higher education, the CBO, media, science and economics, Republicans don't see truth as objective. They believe it is simply a matter of opinion and anyone or anything which says they're wrong must be biased because there's no way they can actually be wrong. Because of this Republicans will enact policies that are dangerous without any concern for the consequences for the future or even themselves. This erratic behaviour makes them frustrating at best and dangers to themselves and others at worst. Simply put, Republicans could do pretty much anything despite how crazy and stupid it seems. In many ways, Trump personifies the GOP better than John McCain or Mitt Romney ever could because of his combination of ignorance and arrogance.

Finally, they lack respect and compassion for others. As can be seen from policies like gerrymandering and voter suppression, tactics like the obstruction from the GOP on things like the Supreme Court and just their general behaviour like the nomination of Trump who is basically a prejudiced bully, Republicans seem more motivated by a need to beat liberals and to control America than any desire for self improvement or any moral concerns. Their indifference to problems like racism, sexism and homophobia should anger liberals. Also their lack of concern for police shootings or sexual assault and their contempt for abortion makes them a genuine danger to women and minorities. Their priority seems to be to preserve a social order in which they have their values imposed on those they view to be inferior (e.g. women, minorities, the poor, LGBT) even if it's at their own expense.

So am I wrong about how bad Republicans are or should liberals not fear them because Republicans will quickly lose power?

"CMV: ""White privilege"" is a counterproductive way to talk about power imbalances",1558,458,2018-05-31 03:43:42,"**Some context before I explain my view**: I'm a sociology and anthropology professor at a small liberal arts college in the American South. The school is both more conservative \*and\* more heavily African American than most colleges, and my view has been informed by teaching in that environment. I'm from New York and was educated at elite schools in the northeast, and the last few years have been my first experience having to lead discussions in such diverse classrooms. I'm also a white guy, so my perspective and role in the classroom are influenced by that.

As an educator I'm trying to convey complex social science topics to students in ways that give them the best chance of getting something out of the conversation. My experience has been that classroom discussions specifically about white privilege get derailed because white male students get immediately defensive. In a lot of cases, their reactions are tied to their own personal struggles. They grew up poor, in a single\-mother household, joined the military for lack of better options, suffered a traumatic brain injury in Iraq, etc. and they perceive the very phrase ""white privilege"" as trivializing their life experience. 

**My view**: The term ""white privilege"" is alienating the people who are most in need of convincing and we're better off framing the conversation in other terms. Using terminology that engenders that kind of response further silos us as a society and is counterproductive. I'm not really sure I have a better alternative but, FWIW, I've had success introducing the concept of privilege by way of intersectionality, which simultaneously legitimizes struggles due to class, disability, or whatever else.",1
CMV: Cultural appropriation is benign at worst and extremely beneficial at best.,1552,647,2018-09-05 08:43:37,"I am genuinely dumbfounded by the number of people who believe that cultural appropriation is harmful. Taking issue with cultural appropriation seems to be the equivalent of a child throwing a fit because someone else is ""copying"" him. 

I can understand how certain aspects of appropriation can be harmful if done improperly (ex. taking credit for originating a practice that was originated by another culture, appropriating in order to mock, poorly mimicking the appropriated practice thereby attaching an unearned stigma to it, etc.). I do not, however, understand how one can find the act of appropriation problematic in and of itself. In most cases, it seems like cultural appropriation is the opposite of bad (some would say good). Our alphabet, our numerals, mathematics, spices, gunpowder, steam power, paper, and countless other things have been ""appropriated"" (I am 100% sure that a more extensive list that makes the point more effectively can be made by someone with more than a cursory understanding of history). And thank God they were. Cultural appropriation seems to be a driving force in innovation and general global improvement. 

The idea that one culture needs permission from another in order to adopt a practice seems palpably absurd. It violates the basic liberties of the appropriator(s) (and does not violate any rights of the appropriated). The concept makes little sense when applied to entire cultures. It breaks down entirely when applied at the individual level. If my neighbor cooks his meat in such a way that makes the meat more appealing to me, I should have nothing stopping me from mimicking him. Is my neighbor obligated to reveal any secrets to me? Absolutely not. But does he have any genuine grievance with me? Surely not. 

I simply do not see how appropriation is bad. Note: I am referring exclusively to the act of appropriation. I am not necessarily referring to negative practices that tend to accompany appropriation. 

(Edit: I am blown away by the positivity in this thread. I'm glad that we can take a controversial topic and talk about it with civility. I didn't expect to get this many replies. I wish I could respond to them all but I'm a little swamped with homework.)",1
CMV Being a skeptic is not the same as being a denier,1553,398,2019-11-19 17:14:48,"I have a science background as well as economics, I have a solid understanding of how dangerous it can be to use models as facts, how difficult it can be to collect valid and reliable data and to make reliable inferences.

I'm tired however of when I ask any kind of question, online or in person about climate change that I'm looked at with disgust.

I think being a skeptic makes the science better, it makes the interventions stronger and it refines the communication.

The following I think are incredibly important questions to ask and any climate activist should be doing everything they can to strengthen their arguments:

1. Climate change is real - My question would be to define climate change, what it is, what caused it, what are the models saying and at what level of confidence.
2. We need to act on climate change - What is you would like to do, who will do these things, who will pay for these changes and what would these changes achieve.

I am not a denier - I am a skeptic and you should be too.

\*Update\*

Awesome discussion. Some very passionate people who are willing to give their time to help others understand climate change. Some of you have questioned my intentions with (I think) the assumption I have low level of understanding and I'm looking to reject. I'm already of the opinion that I will be moving my family off grid within 10 years based on a range of environmental factors and that the question I have are to go from 'good' understanding to 'pretty damn sharp'. 

Based on the deltas I've given I feel I would be comfortable in saying having questions about climate change and being of a confrontational and inquisitive nature is different to identifying as a skeptic. Asking questions takes correct context and nuance.

When I ask what are the models saying and at what confidence - I want to know what part of the world I should be living in with a solid degree of confidence. 

When I ask what would you like to do - I want to know your plans, I know mine, I want to know what Elon Musk and Bill Gates have planned.",1
"CMV: As a non-american, I see Trump as a total regression for the US and Bernie Sanders the total opposite.",1547,1309,2016-03-03 22:19:41,"I can't deal with it, I'm trying to use logic but it seems I'm incapable to see why someone who's in his right mind would vote for Donald Trump.

I don't know if there's something about a major lack of education or a really strong wish for going backwards in history in the US. 

From an outsider perspective, this guy represents -at least ideologically- everything that is wrong in human and modern civilization.

Now I'm reading about this Bernie Sanders and his propositions, and I can't understand why anyone with a bit of common-sense and who wants the US to achieve some kind of development as a nation won't vote for him. 

I see that guy as the only option.

EDIT: Whoa! A lot of interesting and insightful answers. I think I have a better picture of these two guys now.

**Trump**: I see Trump's figure is being manipulated strongly by the media, with much of his comments being taken out of context. He's saying a lot of things that many americans want to hear. Apparently there's a difference between his ""show figure"" and his actual positions, which are considered pretty traditionally American by many of you. And a lot of comments refer to Trump's business achievements as something positive, skills that would be reflected in the country if he's elected.

I sense there's a feeling of overall dissatisfaction with Obama, may be helped by the social media. I can't help but think that Trump's biggest strenght is pretty much being a big anti-Obama reaction in many ways: politically, socially and economically.

**Bernie**: Many of you said that you like Bernie's positions and that much of them should be good for the people, but the problem is they're pretty much utopic or unrealistic. Others stated that his vision of the economy would harm America and that the fact that he doesn't have ""real"" achievements in politics or comparing to Trump, in any business at all, is something pretty negative.

The bottom-line as I see it and that it was pointed out by some of you is that both of them are running heavily ideological campaigns, which makes them very similar characters, each in their own way.",1

Now I will acknowledge sometimes identity automatically gives you more value in some topics. For example, diversity matters when talking about Islam, because a Muslim can talk from experience. But I dont think having a Muslim person in unrelated cases is worth anything just because they're Muslim.

In general, I'd rather have a board of 10 straight white males with all differing political stances and opinions than a board of black, white, men, women, and whatever else inbetween that all have the same (usually far left) opinions. If that makes any sense.

CMV: Religion does not deserve to have any special protections.,1541,267,2019-04-03 20:02:23,"A religion, in it's most simple form is the belief in a god, gods, deity, or supreme beings. Some religions command you to live by certain tenants while others motivate you to follow a specific path of spiritually. Overall, they all can be argued to give the follower a sense of purpose and belonging or meaning in life. 

However, just because you deeply believe in something does not make it factual. What is supported and given mobility in society should be reasonable and defendable to an objective level. 

For what reason does any religion have a right to be given special protections against questioning, societal obligations, or laws and institutions themselves? A religion should be thought of as any other type of thought or opinion and should be handled critically. If no proper reasoning can be used to justify a belief, then said belief is simply unjustifiable. 

Seeming as how there is no real reasoning used to justify any religion, I fail to see why there are any special protections for any of them.

"CMV: Religious people should not ""pick and choose"" which parts of their religious text they choose to follow/believe if they believe it is the Word of God",1537,332,2017-07-15 02:38:27,"To preface this, I was raised Lutheran (Christian) my entire life, but I currently identify as agnostic. My entire family is extremely religious. This view of mine is moreso oriented at Christians, although it could of course expand to other religions. 



To phrase this in the context of Christianity, I find it extremely hypocritical for Christians who, for example, are against gay marriage or think homosexuality is a sin but who have tattoos. Or have had premarital sex. Or are divorced. Or committed adultery. The list goes on. 



There are so many things the Bible says you shouldn't do. I don't feel like Christians can pick and choose which parts of the Bible they would like to follow and which ones are okay to not follow. Sometimes people will say that there's a difference between the Old and New Testaments in belief systems. However, Leviticus 19:19 states that one should not wear clothing woven of different types of material - but Christians have no problem wearing cotton polyester blends or other fabric mixtures. Yet Leviticus 18 and 20 communicates that homosexuality is a sin, and the majority of Christians, while possibly accepting to a gay person, still feel as if gay marriage is unholy. Same book. 



I do understand that there are Christians who support gay marriage, which also confuses me since I feel like in order to have faith and truly believe in your God, that you would also have to believe the *full* word of God (aka the Bible), not just certain parts. 



Moreover, how can someone believe in certain scientific findings when the Bible clearly contradicts them? For example, the earth is billions of years old, but the Bible says differently. Is the Word of God wrong? If you believe in those scientific facts, then how can you believe in the Bible if it's wrong? 



I guess what I'm ultimately saying is that if one truly *believes* in their God, then they must also fully believe in and abide by the religious text (""words of God"") as well, not just certain parts. ",1
CMV: Fliptop toothpaste caps are universally better than screwtop caps,1533,123,2017-03-19 20:04:46,"After buying a new brand of toothpaste (Crest) because it was on sale instead of my usual brand (Colgate), I was horrified to find that it came with a screwtop cap. After using it for a week, it's obvious that fliptop caps are universally better than screwtop caps and there should be no reason for screwtop capped toothpaste to remain on the market.

Benefits of fliptop:

* It's faster to open.
* It can be opened one handed, leaving the other hand to hold the toothbrush.
* You don't have to find a place to put the screwtop while brushing your teeth.
* You don't risk the top falling down the drain and being lost forever.
* For households with young children, the screwtop is a potential choking hazard.
* Screwtops require much better hand-eye co-ordination to close which can be challenging first thing in the morning.

In short, screwtops are worse in every single way than fliptops and deserve to die a fiery death.

"CMV: caffeine content of beverages should have to clearly displayed on the front of the bottle like alcohol content on beer, wine, and spirits.",1533,365,2014-12-15 01:47:02,"Caffeine is a drug that is often overlooked and it's negative effects genreally glossed over in our society. Clearly it's not as bad as alcohol and not needed to calculate a ""safe"" dose in the case of caffeine but cleaclearly labeling the caffeine content will allow people to see how much caffeine they ingest at a glance. Many people are not aware of how much caffeine is in soda and often get addicted to caffeine without realizing it is happeneing. I think that one of the reasons beverage companies use caffeine in many drinks is to get people hooked on that beverage. Many people are also sensitive to caffeine and could use the labels to judge wether or not they want to drink that drink late in the day or when they need to sleep. Caffeine also is bad for people with certain heart conditions and will increase the likely hood a person will avoid that drink if they choose to consume less caffeine. Overall I think adding the content will help because it subliminaly shows people that caffeine is a drug and should be treated like it while increasing consumer awareness and choice while also not discouraging or inconvenienceing anyone who chooses to use caffeine.

CMV: It is stupid for companies to require an app to use their services,1534,122,2018-09-18 00:07:37,"I have noticed a trend that many companies require you to use an app to use their services and don't allow you to do things from their website, for seemingly no good reason. For example, it is no longer possible to transfer money on Venmo from a PC, you need to use an app.

I believe this is a terrible business practice for number of reasons:

1. Access. Only about 77% of Americans have smartphones and many of those only have a smartphone that is issued through work and may have restrictions on installing new apps. 87% of Americans have a computer at home. By not allowing computer based transactions, they are cutting out over 30 million potential customers who do not own a smartphone but do own a computer. People who don't own computers can also use a computer at a public library or their jobs as well. If you add in other countries the amount of potential customers lost would be even larger.
2. Interface/user experience. Using a 5"" phone to do anything is always less convenient than using a computer with a large screen (or multiple screens) and large physical keyboard, especially with people who have visual or motor impairments.
3. Security. It is much easier to steal a smartphone and access someone's accounts than it is to steal a computer. Many users of certain services, like Venmo, would never use an app if they had access to the services through a web interface.
4. Privacy. There are many services that people don't want on their phone for privacy reasons. For example, I'm sure there are many married people who don't want dating apps on their phones that they are using for cheating, especially if they are employer issued. Web portals are much more private in this regard because there is no overt trace of use. Tinder, for example, has realized this and rolled out a web interface to their previously app-only interface.
5. Negligible costs. For large VC funded companies, having their core functionality be accessible from both a web portal and an app are negligible compared to the benefits.

I literally can see no good reason why a company would force you to use an app for a service that can also be performed using a computer through a web interface. EDIT: To clarify, I'm not saying there is anything wrong with companies offering apps, but it should just be another option, not a requirement, unless the service is unique to mobile applications and simply wouldn't work on a computer (e.g. Pokemon Go).",1
CMV: Parents shouldn't pierce their babies ears before the child can verbally ask for it.,1526,317,2018-01-10 10:39:49,"I'm actually having this debate with my wife at the moment.  For context, our baby girl just turned 6 months old.  Many out there, including our pediatrician, believe that it is best to pierce the babies ears before she is old enough to ""understand the pain.""  Also, for full disclosure I actually love the idea of my daughter having earrings, just not before *she wants* them.

But I simply cannot understand doing this to a baby and that's why I am here.  Change my view.  Literally everybody (granted, a small sample size of around a dozen people) I have spoken to says I should have my babies ears pierced, but I just can't get behind it.

So let's forget about my baby, and just talk about babies in general.  To start, baby girls:

What if a baby girl doesn't want her ears pierced when she is older?  Why should the choice be made for her?  They are tiny holes but they are still mostly permanent.

Getting a shot (injection) is pain, but it provides a benefit.  Who is to say that earring holes are a benefit?  Certainly not the baby right?

So, why would parents subject their baby to pain at all without a clear benefit?  The logic is lost on me, entirely.

Baby boys:

I know one couple that had their baby boy ears pierced.  I'm not trying to start a gender debate here.  But statistically speaking, most boys in the English speaking world do not wear earrings.  So I have the same argument here as I do with girls, but even stronger statistics to back it up.  Granted, I'm fine with boys getting earrings, but again...it is when *they* want one/several.

**tl:dr**  *I believe that piercing a babies ears takes away what could be an exciting decision they make for themselves, about themselves, early in life.  It also subjects them to a small amount of discomfort for, what I believe, is no benefit.*

I am hopeful that the responses here will either change my view entirely, or make me hate the idea less.  It is causing some pretty serious friction in my family and in-laws.

NOTE:  I could almost see an argument about religious beliefs or cultural practices.  But that is not what I am here to discuss.

EDIT:  I had no idea how many views/comments I was going to get here.  I will attempt to give Delta's where/when I can as many of you bring up some good points.  I haven't fully changed my view, but this is clearly more complicated than I originally thought.  That said, thank you to everybody that has commented and contributed to the conversation.

"CMV: in the Price is Right, the third contestant in One Bid should never bid $1.",1526,146,2019-11-09 01:40:23,"I see it all the time: four people playing One Bid on the Price is Right, trying to get the closest to the value of the item without going over.  The first and second contestants bid too high, and the third says ""one dollar"", confident that theirs isn't over.  But then comes the fourth contestant, who frequently will counter with $2.  To bid a dollar, the third contestant would have to believe that the goods are actually worth $1 (never happens and I think it might be impossible), or that the fourth player will believe that the goods are worth more than a prior bid even though the third contestant doesn't think they in fact are.  But how could one know that about the fourth player's beliefs?  And furthermore, the $1 actually reduces their chances of believing that as it draws their attention to the fact that you think it isn't.  So as #3, you should never bid $1 but should bid some credible amount that has a non-zero chance of being too high.  This way #4 has to choose between $1 and outbidding you (or someone higher than you).  Yet I see this third person $1 - under saw it today - are these people just idiots or am I missing something?

"CMV: If states vote to ban abortion, they should be required to establish state-funded support systems for women and children in need - and those systems should be up for vote, too.",1524,397,2019-05-23 23:44:05,"For the record, I am vehemently pro-choice and that part of my view will not be changed. 

That said, if this is the direction our country is voting to go, I believe we should require more government-funded support organizations and easements for the people directly impacted by this decision (women and children in need).

I’ve admittedly not considered all the pros, cons and logistics of setting something like this in motion, but i believe it’s beyond irresponsible to pass laws and restrictions that will have significant short and long-term impact on our country’s population, culture, economy and healthcare systems without requiring a support system for the inevitable *equal or opposite reactions.*

Fundamentally, I don’t think it’s possible to take something away without giving something back to fill the void. If we’re going to make matters of personal choice (such as abortion) non-negotiable, state-level decisions, then those states (not *just* independently funded organizations) need to accept responsibility for the impact on their individual citizens and the resulting health of their larger communities. 

Perhaps this is a basic concept for solving a complex issue, but it’s my view nonetheless. CMV.",1
CMV: Proportional representation (multi party system) is better than winner takes all (two party system).,1518,246,2018-06-02 21:06:08,"In a two party, winner-takes-all system you can't vote for a third party you agree more with, because that is subtracting a vote from the major party that you agree with the most. And that's basically equivalent to voting for the party you agree the least with. So in essence: voting for the party you agree with the most is practically voting for the party you agree with the least. This is why it's a two party system. 

Now you have a country with two tribes that benefit from attacking anything the other tribe stands for. An us and them mentality on a more fundamental level then it has to be. You also artificially group stances of unrelated issues together, like social issues and economic issues,  and even issues inside of those. Why can I statistically predict your stance on universal health care if I know your stance on gun control? That doesn't make much sense. 

But the most crucial point is how the winner takes all system discourages cooperation on a fundamental level. Cooperation is is the most effective way to progress in politics, it's like rowing with the wind versus rowing against it. 

If we look at proportional representation systems, this cooperation is a must. Each party HAS to cooperate, negotiate and compromise with other parties if they even want to be in power at all. This is because multiple parties has to collaborate to form a government (equivalent of the white house) with a majority of votes between them. Since they are different parties in government, getting everyone on board every policy is not a given, so playing nice with the opposition is smart in case you need the extra votes in the legislature branch (house of representatives, senate). 

Since there is much less tribalism at play and voters are more likely to switch parties to something that suits them better if they are dissatisfied, the parties has to stay intellectually honest about the issues. The voters won't forgive corruption and lobbying the way they are likely to do in a two party system. 

I would argue that proportional representation is more democratic. This is because you can vote on a small party, say the environmental party for example, and the votes actually matter because the large parties would want to flirt with the small parties to get their representation in legislature and government. Giving the small party leverage to negotiate environmental policy with the large party.

The one argument I have heard in favor of the two party model is that it ensures competence in governing, because both parties would have had experience governing. But in practice, small parties will have proportionally small roles in a collaboration government as they grow, accumulating experience while bringing new ideas and approaches with them as they eventually reach a point where they have dangerous responsibility. 

e: my reference is the Scandinavian model vs the US model.

"CMV: You cannot reject parts of the bible and believe others. If you decide what to believe or not believe, it defeats the whole point of a religious dogma.",1524,643,2015-09-23 01:28:02,"Two major arguments I have. 

1. In general, rules cannot be selectively followed, or it defeats their purpose. The whole reason rules exist is because humans cannot be trusted to decide for themselves how to behave. But selectively following rules means that humans get to do just that, and rules have no power. So, if people choose to ignore the rule in the bible about [not mixing fabrics](http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-11.htm), then they can justify ignoring rules like don't murder, because of the precedent.

2. The bible is accepted based on faith that the word of God is infallible. If you believe parts of the word of God are false, than you are rejecting the premise that it's infallible, and thus there's no reason to believe in any of it. If you contend that parts of the bible are metaphorical, or were modified from their original text, then you open up the passages that you do believe in to the same criticism.

I'm not trying to be an /r/atheist-esque religious basher, or anything. I'm just genuinely curious how this is reconciled. And I'm very open to the possibility that I'm misunderstanding what 'faith' means, since I've never really had it in my life.

CMV: It is contradictory to be both a Libertarian and be in favor of net neutrality.,1515,481,2017-11-22 21:58:24,"I’m sure I’ll get hit with a lot of highly technical reasons why I’m wrong, but I’m looking for a layman’s answer. As I understand it, the only way to ensure net neutrality is by heavy government regulation of ISPs. Comcast and Verizon and all them would have loved to have a non-neutral Internet from the jump, but the government reigned them in.

Libertarians, in theory, want as little government intervention into private business and life as possible. 

So how can a libertarian be in favor of a policy that is *based* on government interference in the private businesses that are ISPs?

CMV!

To be clear, I’m very in favor of net neutrality. But I’m also in favor of a lot of government regulations. I’ve just been surprised to see on Reddit that so many people are in favor of net neutrality because I thought a bunch of Redditors were also libertarians. Not that that means no redditors are liberal, but hopefully you all know what I mean!

Edit: Thanks guys! I've replied to a few great answers below. I think I was using a broad view of libertarianism and forgetting that everyone's political philosophies are goals, not practical applications. And apparently since libertarians don't like government sanctioned monopolies, but that's going on anyway in the current system, they'd rather have those monopolies be sanctioned in a way that benefits citizens.

"CMV: I believe emphasizing that ""being gay is born rather than a choice"" is irrelevent and gay rights should be the same no matter if homosexuality is born with, nurtured or chosen.",1511,425,2014-09-09 03:50:46,"So simply speaking, I do not think it is wise for gay right organizations to link the (still under debate) idea of innate homosexuality with gay rights. If someone choose to be gay, it should be perfectly ok. An analogy is like someone choose to convert to another religion, and this is totally protected by law.

Even if science proves that homosexuality is a (subconscious) choice rather than born with, it do not change how much rights LGBT can have at all. Now with a strong linkage of innate homosexuality to pro-gay-right, if any evidence came out in the other way, that would be severely detrimental to gay rights. In other words, LGBT groups chained their goals to something that is not solid. They should reduce the emphasize on ""born with"", but more in ""one adult can love another adult, period"".

CMV: Water resources should be under state control,1512,297,2019-12-05 23:28:44,"This post is inspired mainly by my (perhaps limited) knowledge of Florida water rights but could apply elsewhere as well. Nestle has come under fire again here and in Michigan for it's water extraction. According to the article linked below, Florida landowners have rights to the water which can be pumped or sold for small permitting fees. Now as someone who themselves has a well for my household water I understand the need for land owners to have water access, but I believe this needs to be regulated closer. Water can't be compared to other mineral rights, as it's extraction from one area will affect levels and supply everywhere (especially Florida where almost all the freshwater is interconnected by the underground aquifer).

Currently, this water is not taxed or regulated closely by the state. Local governments and districts have a lot of control in who can buy land and tap into rivers and springs. This makes it easy for aspiring corporations to get access to resources with little oversight. Especially in the low population areas where these operations are typically located, large corporations have no trouble buying out landowners and councils who otherwise may not be able to afford to not take the deal. It's even more egregious because it is going towards bottled water which of course has an even larger environmental impact down the line. Unlike other industries that may pump out water for use in a value added sense, we as a public are not seeing any revenue from this product.

I think this should come under state regulation and water usage should at the very least be taxed on a usage basis (rather than a small one-time fee). Additionally, this use should be subject to terms that change on a regular basis based on impact studies, rainfall numbers, etc. This would give more public oversight as well... officials in charge would be subject to voters all around the state rather than just the local voters. This is important because as I said, the water resources impact the state as a whole, not just the small regions where the water is located. It's frustrating as it is now because even though I can sign petitions or protest, ultimately I have no voting representation to help influence a resource that I enjoy both recreationally and that is essential to my and my future generations' livelihood.

I made this CMV because I'm sure there are downsides to managing this at the state level. I would like to hear those and consider whether they would outweigh the positives.

&#x200B;

Edit: This has gotten a lot of traction, thanks for all the discussion. I'm sorry if I didn't get to everyone. I've definitely learned it's a complicated situation. I'm not really swayed by fears of corruption or tyranny etc. since that can happen at any level of government. Some people have pointed out that bottling is small compared to agriculture. I'll concede that it is probably a smaller impact than other industries but that doesn't weigh on the larger point of whether water for all industries should be regulated by state or not. 

It's also interesting to consider whether the water should belong to those whose land it is on or redistributed to everyone equally. This consideration is the most intriguing to me and I think there are good arguments for both. I think part of the problem is that water is just too cheap which leads it to be overused. I believe it should be taxed at either the local or state level so that use is paid for proportional to the amount taken.",1
CMV: I don't think a lack of attraction to transgender people is transphobic,1512,665,2018-07-08 08:22:01,"Attraction comes from internal states as well as cultural and social influence. Attraction is a result of both upbringing and societal beliefs (being attracted to a certain race, or to someone who reminds you of a person from your past) Attraction is also a result of our hormones and brain.

"CMV: It makes no sense that Democrats John Conyers and Al Franken were forced to resign while many (but of course, not all) Republicans still support Blake Farenthold, Roy Moore and Donald Trump, who aren't being cornered with the same zero-tolerance policy.",1513,609,2017-12-13 21:38:52,"I'm not condoning Conyers or Franken. What they did is wrong, regardless of how great they were on the legislative front. Nevertheless, I don't understand how anyone -- regardless of their political leanings -- can support someone who clearly engaged in sexual misconduct.
&nbsp;

Trump, for example, infamously stated -- on tape -- that ""You know I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. I just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything...Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything."" On top of Trump being accused of sexually harassing women and making lewd comments about their appearances on record, Ivana Trump also accused the president of raping her. 
&nbsp;

Regarding Moore -- Yes, Moore lost the senate race last night, but he was never pressured enough to actually leave the race, as many (again, not all) Republicans supported him. And Moore has been accused of sexual harassing/assaulting several women. According to the New York Daily News, ""A retired Alabama police officer said she was told to keep an eye on Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore back in the 1980s because he was known to harass teenage cheerleaders at local school ballgames...'We were also told to watch him at the ballgames and make sure that he didn’t hang around the cheerleaders,' Faye said. 'The rumor was that Roy Moore likes young girls,' she added. 'It was not only in our department but at the courthouse, too.'"" 
&nbsp;

Republicans also seem split on whether Farenthold should resign, even though, according to the NYT, ""He was sued over accusations of sexual harassment three years ago, paid out an $84,000 settlement, financed by taxpayers, and has an open Ethics Committee investigation into his behavior. Yet only a few Republicans have called for his resignation.""
&nbsp;

It seems the only Republican forced to resign among sexual conduct allegations is Trent Franks. Is there something I'm missing? I'm genuinely confused.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

EDIT: First of all, thank you to everyone thus far who has commented and/or discussed this topic with me! I'm learning a lot from this conversation. One issue that's been frequently coming up is proof vs. allegation. A common argument that's been made is that Republicans require proof before relinquishing support, whereas Democrats do not. In Franken's case, there's a photograph of him groping a sleeping woman. The proof is there. But I wonder, if Franken were a Republican, would his party stop backing him? There's also the argument of allegation vs. conviction. While Farenthold wasn't convicted, he did settle a sexual harassment lawsuit with taxpayer money. Doesn't that, to at least SOME extent, factor into proof of the allegation? Someone mentioned that resigning is an admittance of guilt (like in both Conyer's and Franken's case). But isn't settling a lawsuit with money also an admittance of guilt?

CMV: Forcing a child to finish everything on their plate creates an unhealthy relationship with food.,1515,191,2020-07-25 16:46:25,"Making a child eat everything on their plate will in one way or another damage someone's view on food.   

I have seen this outcome often and it's usually expressed in a few ways:

1. People don't stop eating when they are full. I don't want to offend anyone but a lot of the people I know who struggle with their weight been brought up in homes where they weren't allowed to leave the table until they had cleaned their plates. 
2. Meal time becomes a chore or downright unpleasant. When I went to stay with my father and his partner she would make me eat everything on my plate, I didn't portion the food out myself and it was often food that she wouldn't eat and that I hated. Meal time became me taking an hour to eat something because I was gagging between bites. I know people who are very picky eaters because they were forced as children to eat food that made them feel sick.
3. People who have small appetites will portions out less for themselves because being hungry is better than feeling sick.  
4. It creates fear of going without ""if you don't finish you won't get anything else"" can sound like ""I'm going to punish you for not finishing by leave you out""  
5. It makes someone a picky eater, you're going to stick to what you like if you're going to be made to eat all of it. 
6. Food becomes a reward ""if you eat everything you'll get dessert"" this creates two problems, for some people it's ""I've been good I can have this"" and for some people it's ""I haven't been good enough so I can't have this"" 
7. It can cause a dislike for certain foods, sometimes to the point of a phobia. In the same household I was often fed soggy, fatty bacon that was cooked in a microwave, if I even smell bacon cooking it makes me feel sick and this is more than a decade later. I have encountered this with many people I know who can't stand different dishes or ingredients.

Instead a child should be encouraged to try everything more than once without the pressure to eat all of it and if they genuinely don't like it then that's ok, also if a child doesn't manage to finish then they can eat it another day.

CMV: A doctor telling their patient that they need to lose weight shouldn't be considered fat shaming.,1515,301,2017-02-20 13:18:01,"I don't believe that anyone should be shamed for their body, but I don't believe that a doctor telling a patient that losing weight will improve their health counts as fat shaming. With the exception of those who are forced into obesity by a health defect I believe obesity completely preventable. Honestly, it seems downright irresponsible that a doctor would not inform someone whose health is hurt by their weight that they need to change something. It's never a bad idea to be sensitive about it, but you can't simply let someone continue to damage their health to avoid hurt feelings.


**EDIT:** Added some examples below.
 

http://jezebel.com/5959682/doctors-are-shitty-to-fat-patients

http://www.xojane.com/healthy/dear-doctors-quit-it-weight-bullying

http://www.xojane.com/healthy/standing-your-doctor-about-fat-shaming


To be clear, I do understand that in some cases a doctor dismissing a patient's symptoms as a result of their weight can lead to serious health issues going ignored and that's definitely not okay, my issue is simply with patients who are told to lose weight (in a clinical, not crude way) taking as shaming. 

**EDIT:** Wow, didn't expect to wake up to this many responses! Going through everyone's comments now!


**EDIT:** My view has been partially changed. While I do still believe that it's the responsibility of a doctor to bring up the subject of your weight if it's significant enough to become a risk to your health, regardless of whether or not it's the main reason for your visit because they are there to look after your health, I've also seen that there's a fundamental flaw with simply telling a patient they need to lose weight without exploring why it is that they're struggling with it to begin with. There's always the possibility it's just down to laziness, but depression, lack of nutritional knowledge, and several other things are more common than I realized as underlying issues. 


As for people feeling shamed and angry because they have other issues which go ignored because they are automatically dismissed as a result of their weight: while I still believe this is a separate issue from my question (as that was about patients feeling shamed simply because it was brought up they could benefit from losing some weight, rather than only mentioning their weight regardless of other issues) this seems to be much more common than I believed. I intend to research more about it, but I assumed as clinically trained professionals it had to be a rare phenomenon. I still think in many of these cases weight management could probably have reduced symptoms or allowed an earlier diagnosis, but clearly it's an issue regardless. I do also see how this could, understandably, but people on the defensive enough about their weight so that even when their issue is addressed, if weight is brought up afterwards or in addition to it, their feelings could be hurt enough that in their mind that was the focus of the visit.

CMV: That Alpha Male v. Beta Male concept in humans is bullshit.,1514,735,2018-07-02 22:59:46,"There are entire industries that exploit the false idea of alphas and betas in human beings, but in reality it is a cheap scam.  The idea is overly vague and also sexist.

I argue that only the people (usually men) who watch videos about “being alpha” on the internet know very much about this concept because it is, in reality, not a good descriptor of the actual happenings between people in the real world.

The concept is also too vague. If you research the concept of alpha, what you will get is a myriad of men and women listing different, occasionally contradictory, and extremely vague concepts. This essentially amounts to being told to be confident. 

The concept is sexist as well, as the concept depends on a rigid definition of what a “man” can be, and also assumes that women lack autonomy when around an “alpha” man. 

There are many other reasons why this concept is wrong and harmful, but this is just a few of them.

EDIT: My position is that this concept does not describe interactions between humans in a meaningful way. And honestly, we should move on to more useful and accurate concepts.",1
CMV: The elimination of plastic drinking straws in 1st world countries will have little or no effect on the environment.,1514,268,2018-08-22 02:16:21,"Alright to begin with I should state:

-Plastic is bad and it would be better to recycle straws or use a biodegradable material instead.

-Pollution is bad and is having a detrimental effect on sea birds, turtles, etc. 

-Fast food chains should work towards producing less waste. 

*However*

If you live in a developed country, your garbage does not end up in the ocean. It goes from your latte to the trash can to the dumpster to a truck to a landfill.

Any time a business advertises itself as ""straw free"" they always put up pictures of sea turtles and link to photos of Pacific Ocean garbage patches. 

Eliminating plastic straws and cutting your plastic 6-pack rings is a nice sentiment, but it's insignificant compared to other sources of pollution, e.g. excessive plastic wrap on new products. 


EDIT: Please see u/citizenjack's comment about how small, insignificant changes can actually backfire due to the fact that human psychology sucks. Let's continue to eliminate waste, but not fool ourselves. ""Baby steps"" are not enough and are just being used as advertising by the big polluters.

"CMV: No matter how good the intentions are behind it, no restriction of free speech is a good idea.",1513,516,2018-05-14 12:55:49,"Now, I should note that this primarily focuses on hate speech laws, but anything really in this sense can apply. Let's get started.

CLARIFICATION: I'm primarily speaking about laws preventing the expression of beliefs, primarily politically.

ANOTHER CLARIFICATION: I'm speaking about laws akin to hate speech laws, not like, the promotion of crime, etc.

Context:
Recently I've been in an on-and-off argument with a close friend over hate speech laws. Her argument is that hate speech laws do more good than harm as they protect targeted minorities, and prevent the spread of racist and/or otherwise opinions. Part of her argument is also that if I support hate speech, why do I believe it should be legal?

I should make it brutally clear, I'm not a minority in any senses other than that I'm transgender and lesbian. However, I wouldn't make my opinion a double standard even if it was attacking me.

My belief:
The right to free speech should in no way be impeded or changed. Now, I believe this for a couple of key reasons:

- More pro-free-speech oriented
    - Giving away any right to the government, for any reason, cannot be taken back. Imagine if we handed away the fourth amendment. The cops could barge in any old time without reason.
    - Giving the right to silence permanently opens the door to government-sponsored censorship.
        - As such, by giving the power to do so to the government, you inherently put it into the hands of ""the wrong person"" (Someone with the intent to silence other opinions, regardless of theirs).
    - A society without truly free expression will be like a twenty-five year old kept in a sterile room their entire life -- The common cold will leave them deathly ill. What I'm trying to say is, if society is never exposed to differing arguments, said differing arguments will spread like the plague.
    - People who are silenced always speak louder than their silencer, meaning that ideas will spread quicker, and likely ""underground"". Limiting free speech will inherently bring a new free thought renaissance.

- More specific arguments against hate speech laws
    - I've seen absolutely no evidence in any arguments supporting these that they curb the tide of hate speech. Hell, even in Europe where hate speech laws are rampant, identitarian movements and other hate-based beliefs are growing exponentially.
    - What is determined as profane and offensive is extremely situational, and as such, there's no proper way to parameterize it. What I'm trying to say here is that a specific ruling will either bring in a lot of false-positives, or will create a lot of false-negatives. Too restricted speech will silence the incorrect people, too lax will let hate speech run free.
        - A recent example of a false-positive would be Count Dankula, the dude who taught his dog to perform the Nazi salute. This sounds bad, but in reality, he was performing a baseline juxtaposition for the sake of comedy. It's extremely unlikely he actually believes in Nazism.
    - You cannot get rid of hate speech laws once you have them. _After all, wouldn't removing them be siding with hate speech?_
    - Again, if the wrong people get this power, there is strong potential the table will be flipped, and say, your very own views will get silenced.
    - Hate speech laws based off offense will bring in more false positives than anything. Anyone can get offended at anything rather easily. It'll be the witch hunts all over again.

- More specific arguments against her argument
    - The ability for hateful opinions to be expressed is a small price to pay to ensure I will forever be allowed to express mine.
    - My support of the legality of an activity does not inherently mean I support the practice myself. 

Now, I don't personally agree with or support hate speech. But, I don't care how vile and insensitive your opinion may be. I might not support it or agree with it, but by god, I'll defend your right to say it until the end of days, as I expect the same courtesy.

"CMV: Hard times create strong men, Strong men create good times, Good times create weak men, Weak men create hard times.",1501,288,2017-11-08 23:20:25,"Let's put this in the context of history to be specific, for example, times when governments with authoritative policies are put into power when the previous government (usually a democracy) is destabilized. Alternatively, when an authoritative government (which was meant to keep things in order) starts becoming too oppressive people will eventually start fighting for a more democratic one to replace it. 

I also think that wars/death/suffering are inevitable when this process is taking place. As long as resources are finite and people are different there will be no end to conflict thus keeping the cycle happening.

My professor said that perhaps the wars and other conflicts need not happen, that maybe we can live in a world of perpetual good times and strong people and break the ""cycle"" suggesting that there might be a solution to this. I on the other hand think that this philosophy is an essential part to the human experience, to learn the importance of struggle and the foolishness of being contented is not something you can just write down and teach the younger generation. It's something that they themselves have to experience as well which is why history keeps repeating itself.

"Amazon could really use a ""filter out Chinese sellers"" option",93744,4048,2020-08-03 03:30:55,"It is so frustrating to shop on Amazon with the Chinese sellers and manufacturers on the site.

The fake reviews are overwhelming (think 50-90% fake reviews on FakeSpot or ReviewMeta), plus the products are cheap and break and when you go back to the manufacturer, most of them don't exist after 1-2 years. I would assume it's the same group of people making crappy merchandise and cycling their names over and over again and buying the same fake reviews.

Beyond this, I'm always worried that they've put some pollutant or carcinogen into the manufacturing process because their regulations are so lax. The examples in the media are countless--toothpaste with  diethylene glycol, pet food that kills our dogs and cats, toys with lead paint, make up with lead, beryllium, bacterial contamination, cheap hardware that self destructs after a year.

And it can be so hard to tell because they often manufacture for companies like Mattel and Nestle so you think you're getting American or European.

This has been going on for decades and we just turn a blind eye to it because they're cheaper. Business ethics wise, they're about where the US was in the 1920s. This is an example of how capitalism can result in deadly consequences without strong governmental regulation.

Please feel free to downvote me into oblivion, whatever, I don't care, I'm just sick of the nonsense.

EDIT: Thank you for the discussion. In response to comments:

\- Of the top 100,000 sellers on Amazon, 58% are from China, 36% from the United States. This does not take into account manufacturing.

"Hiring a Stripper before the day of your supposed to be married to the love of your life is disgusting, and extremely weird.",63905,3419,2020-06-20 08:04:46,"Now if you plan on having an open relationship, I don’t care, and disregard my title, but so many monogamous couples see this an opportunity to get their dick wet one last time or a hot nude man to strip for them.

I hate restaurants/companies that only have Facebook Pages rather than a website.,61759,1460,2020-07-26 17:53:28,"I deleted Facebook in 2011 and since, never looked back and if anything so glad that I did. 

The issue now, FB is so integrated into day to day life people only use that for advertising. 

I hate getting emails about ""Win this product"" then you read how to enter and they say, Like Us/Follow Us and re post Us on Facebook to be entered. 

Or a restaurant which is FB only and clicking the link you are greeted with a million log in screens and limited information. 

IMO this is a rubbish way to get to your target audience and I avoid companies who solely use FB.

Edit 001: Spelling

Edit 002: Wow. Yeah, so this early Sunday morning post has got a lot more upvotes than I expected. Thank you all. 

I'm still reading all of the comments but here are some updates to some of the more common comments I've read so far. 

1. I do get small businesses depend on FB as it's free. Also it's great to have transparency for reviews from genuine consumers. Being able to openly read these comments would be great - but these aren't always visible to non-fb users. Question: Can the FB Page Owner just delete comments/reviews or is this like eBay in which you have to appeal them?

2. Yes, professional websites do cost a lot - agreed. With digital e-commerce/SEO required, this can be difficult for smaller businesses to get into - but there are lots of free domain services with easy to use GUI's (similar user experiences that they would find when using FB Pages to set up/maintain) that also display in Google Search's. 

3. A few comments saying ""I must not be the target audience"" - this is a bit of a tricky one as context matters. The reason I posted this was due to a BBQ Restaurant about 1 hour away from where I live that I wanted to eat at today with my GF. I'm 30, love food (especially BBQ) and have spare disposable income to spend eating out - how am I not the perfect target audience? - the reason I was looking for a website (which lead me directly to there Facebook page) was to find info about Covid Restrictions, whats in the Menu, Pricing and if I could book a table.  The FB page had limited information without having to log in.

4. Seems like a lot of people use fake Facebook profiles to get around things like this. Personally I don't really like the idea of making fake profiles for anything. 

- I'll update further once I've read more of the comments. My app notifications have gone wild. Definitely brightened up my Sunday. Thanks Reddit ✌️",0

"Most soldiers do not “fight for our rights” but rather fight for money, a career, or by compulsion from a draft.",58611,3884,2020-07-23 00:55:15,"The last war that was really about “our rights” was the civil war. Vietnam, WWI, II, Korea, Iraq and Afghanistan were really about global power dynamics. The soldiers that fought in these wars were not defending our rights, because our rights were not really being threatened.

Edit: this has been very interesting! A few points to address.

1.	A repeat theme is that WW2 was about American Rights. I politely disagree. The US entered only after being attacked and having its global position threatened. We had no choice. We had been declining for 5 years to enter the war. Now I guess it’s very true that many people joined the military after Pearl Harbor out of a sense of duty. But I just have a hard time seeing how it was a war for our rights. It was 100% a just war. But much of the justification was learned of only after the fact (most Americans didn’t know of the atrocities happening at concentration camps). 

2.	I never said there was anything wrong with joining for any reason other than patriotic duty. Join for whatever reason! I’m all for it. 

3.	This last point is very important. Many have said that without the military we wouldn’t have all these freedoms and rights so they therefore are fighting for our freedoms and rights by simply existing. This is an interesting notion. Because from my vantage point as an American, our military is the most powerful it has ever been, yet I have seen a steady derogation of American rights and freedoms throughout my entire life - from within. Being a super power does not somehow make our freedoms more secure. It’s actually the opposite IMO. The lack of a credible threat means our government can actually take away our rights without being checked. Look at China and Russia where it’s happening today and has happened for a while. Look at the last 12 years in the US (increased surveillance, Portland, police brutality etc).",0

"Telling a guy to ""Just be confident"" as dating advice is like telling a depressed person to ""Just cheer up"".",58385,3355,2020-10-12 02:32:20,"If i could, ""Just be confident"" don't you think I would be already?!  I hate being nervous around new people, but I can't just decide to not be.  I already understand how important confidence is.  I can't explain why I don't have any because I don't know.

A depressed person may want to cheer up, but they just can't will themselves happy.  There is more to it.

This is how I feel about it.  I know I can't be the only one.

Edit: this blew up/thanks for awards/yadda yadda

A lot of people are saying to ""fake it until you make it"".  That advice also feels dumb.  If I knew how to fake being confident, isn't that just be acting confident?  Even if I do not feel confident acting like I do requires me to know what the fuck I am doing.  It's like, when I try to talk to someone I just met I just lock up and can't think of anything to say.  I make some meek greetings before withdrawing from the conversation into myself.  I know this is an issue, but don't know how to get around it.  If I just knew how to get past that hurdle than I wouldn't have an issue with confidence.  I would just be able to talk to people.  

""fake it until you make it"" falls into the same pitfall.  If I could, I already would!",0

"Until sentenced, the name, face and information of the accused should not be released publicly.",57653,1648,2020-06-09 01:05:00,"This way anyone falsely accused does not get their name dragged through the sand until they have been convicted. We have made it too easy to destroy people's lives on false accusations. I believe protecting the innocent is just as important as prosecuting the guilty. The only downside would be if someone had evidence on the accused, but this could also be found as a part of the investigation process.

So maybe a better definition if the initial hearing is not dismissed and the judge wants to pursue the case further. I just don't think its fair to lose your job over something that's dismissed in 5 minutes in court, because that's all someone with a false accusation wants.

Edit: Thanks for the gold.

Edit: It seems the general consensus is that we all hate to see innocent people's lives ruined. Thank you for restoring my faith in humanity a little.

Edit: The main counter argument (In my own words) - ""The government can abuse this by silently incarcerating and sentencing people, and it has been written into law (US) to release a public record of these events"". So my main problem with this argument is firstly I was referring to protecting innocent people from a false accusation, not from a tyrannical government. If you are being targeted by a tyrannical government, I don't think you really care about slander and being cancelled. However I did not know the reason behind this legislation (in the US) so I appreciate the info. What we should really define is at what point during the legal process does a public record get released? What forms of evidence are needed? Obviously video footage over word of mouth. The whole point of the legal system is you really can't trust people to tell the truth, doesn't matter because until you catch them in a lie you can't tell the difference. Can the media be sued for slander if they publish articles that corroborate a false accusation without doing enough research? Should they be forced to remove these articles or publically renounce any false information? These are all questions that came to mind when reading your comments. Again my main goal is protecting innocent citizens from the horrors of mob justice.

Edit: I keep seeing Sweden pop up in my notifications tab. So shout out to Sweden for protecting the innocent.

Edit: If this opinion was ""popular"" innocent people wouldn't have their lives ruined by this. I think we all know there is a problem and I am glad this post can foster discussion on the matter.

Porn addiction is a massive epidemic in men that society is choosing to ignore.,57221,7888,2019-12-09 21:11:44,"Porn is being promoted as positive and a sort of ritual for men these days. Its deemed by most as a positive pastime and to critique it will be met with scorn and many will see you as against sex positivity for doing so. It is seen by many as a private hobby with no harm to most, except some complaining about misogyny towards women in porn.


However, as growing amounts of evidence show porn is having immensely negative effects on men. Many are becoming addicted to something encouraged and as safe by society. Men are having problems performing in bed with their partner, reduced libidos, fetishes they did not previously have which cause shame, seeing women as sex objects solely, having to watch more intense and degrading and even violent porn to get the same dopemine hit. 


Many men are also attaining erectile dysfunction where they cannot attain an erection without porn or even with porn. Studies into when people first locate porn shows most boys begin watching at around the age of 9-10. The beginning of their sexuality is being distorted and twisted in their formative years when they are vulnerable to an addiction they have no idea about. There are also studies showing that porn consumption causes anxiety and depression in its users. 


There are literally hundreds of thousands of men now coming forward, largely on the internet due to the stigmas of this addiction with their stories. How has this been received? Well as a joke. An ex porn addict went on tv and told a presenter telling him his addiction did not exist that his penis could no longer get hard. Academics researching this area have been mocked and ridiculed for their research.


This problem is only getting worse and if not addressed very soon will probably become one of the greatest concerns for our society on a social level. It will possibly reach an epidemic proportion as men in possibly their millions will be addicted to something very, very hard to quit and the assistance in fixing this issue will be very difficult and very expensive. 



If you are a man who has a positive relationship with porn then thats fine, but this post is to show the unpopular opinion being ignored by society. 


Check out No Fap and Porn Free if you want to see what men are having to silently endure at the moment.


Edit: realized I fucked up the title. My point was that if porn addiction is not addressed and started to be dealt with now I believe in mere decades we could have an epidemic on our hands. Also I swear to god I put this in the post but if you watch porn and are not an addict I am truly happy for you. I am also pro masturbation and sex positive. My point is for a sizeable number of people porn is addictive and this reality needs to be known and we need to help porn addicts. I hope this clarifies everything.

I call those places. The first two are total assholes to me. Very condescending, and telling me I need the model number. Again, the four digit code means nothing to them. I give what’s in the confirmation email from Sears. Not enough. Kenmore doesn’t manufacture their own goods. She needs to know the manufacturer. I’m not at home. I’m sitting in my truck on the phone.   Second call goes just like the first. Treated me like a child. 

At this point I go home, get the info on the manufacturer, and call the third place. Very nice. They don’t have it, but can get it that afternoon. For the low low price of $40. 

I can’t get there in the afternoon, and $40 seems outrageous for a door switch. 

I take a last ditch effort on Amazon. I put in only the four digit code that nobody could work with at four different distributors. 

158 sellers. Most expensive one was $9. It will be here tomorrow.

Being too cold is WAY better than being too warm.,52796,2344,2020-09-20 04:18:47,"Random opinion I just thought about from past experiences. By this I don't mean absolutely freezing/sizzling climates, I just mean from *mildly* warmer/colder weather than normal. I've seen myself be really stressed during warmer weather, with no real way to cool myself at all. On the other hand, with colder climates, it's really easy to cool yourself down; get under a warm blanket, get a hot drink and just **vibe** there I guess. It's really comforting too, probably one of the best feelings ever.

Though this doesn't really make sense if you're outdoors and not inside, it's technically inside I'm talking about. Being outside is a whole different story, though it's technically the same answer on that side in my opinion.

So in conclusion; I don't like going outside because it's too warm  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Choosing to terminate a pregnancy because the child would be handicapped is reasonable,51811,3839,2020-04-24 07:53:03,"Firstly i want to mention that i have worked with both physically and mentally handicapped people and among them were the most lovable, loving and truly inspiring people I've met in my life.

To those who do, whether by choice or not, give birth to handicapped children, you have my deepest respect and I don't doubt that parents will do anything in their power to provide the best life for their children and love them the way they are, but i don't think it's wrong to assume that such a life is more emotionally taxing than raising healthy children.

A lot of the television shows using fully adult actors in a high school setting could easily change their plot to revolve around a college setting instead of the weird fixation television has on displaying the sex lives of high schoolers,50441,1417,2020-09-13 23:24:04,"I think a good example of this is the show Riverdale. If you don’t know, it’s a show using the characters of Archie comics in a teen murder drama ish show. In that show their lives are about whatever big mystery is going on, their relationships, and their friends. The characters in the show are high-school age (16 I believe) but a majority of the cast are actors in their mid-twenties (one actor is almost 29). 

In the show, or as much as I’ve seen, being an actual high school student occupies very little of the character’s lives and the aspects of high school we do see the characters participate it could more or less be translated into a college setting. So why even make them high school students? I know to reach a youth audience and whatever but seeing how a lot of this shows content displays varied sexual relationships between characters, I feel like it’s a bit weird seeing all these high school age relationships so graphically being acted by much older people. 

And I’m realizing now that Riverdale isn’t the *best* example (a plot point of season 1 is an inappropriate teacher student relationship) but there are a lot of shows like this out. I think Hollywood should stop fetishizing high school sexual relationships when they really don’t have to. My issue with it isn’t so much the displays of sex, more that the show creators are leaning so heavily into all the displays of sex of people who are **supposed** to be minors. Gives a weird voyeurism vibe. If the plot allows, just make the setting college, it would even make more sense with the plots sometimes.

TLDR: I have no issue with sex being a plot point in teen-oriented television but the mentality of “We have 27 year olds playing 16 year olds so let’s shoot this soft core porn scene because we can 😎” is very problematic and approaching borderline pedophilic

If you read through these articles, you will find that the theme is *men bad* because they refuse to play the social role written for them. It's mostly from the perspective of how this creates problems for women in the long run, but still that's the core of it.

Contrary to what these journalists would have you believe, I think these young men are acting completely rationally when opting out of this life script. There just aren't enough incentives to play this role, it is too risky and too exhausting, and I can personally see how one would derive way more satisfaction from hanging out with ones mates, playing video games, or being in a band. Young men don't owe society anything. We should just live and let live, and let people enjoy their lives in the way they want to, instead of judging them.

I'm 100% OK with homeless people using my money for booze and cigarettes.,47442,2857,2020-01-18 00:24:00,"Most people I've talked to say they avoid giving money to homeless folks because they think they will use it for beer, cigarettes, and/or drugs.

If my $5 helps get them a pack of cigarettes or a beer and that's what they need to get through another day with the shitty hand they've been dealt then i'm OK with that.

"YouTube (and the Internet as a whole) was much better when people were creating content as a hobby instead of a ""job""",47267,1452,2020-06-01 19:59:55,"It may be just the nostalgia talking, but I very much liked the ""quality"" of the content you could find on the internet back in the day, when the majority was created by people who had real jobs (or schools) and could only create content in their spare time. And I'm not talking only about YouTube videos, but also about general blogs and more ""specialized"" sites.

I'm not 100% sure what it is, but to me it's either that the content was not so much money-driven and people could fully express themselves without caring for the ""brand"" or ""monetization"" or what not, or that they were much more connected to the everyday issues of everyday people.

I'm also not saying there are no good content creators right now, or that all of them are disconnected from the reality, but it's kind of sad that it's not the norm anymore.

Being a single dad with half custody is just as hard as being a single mom but I don't have a rally cry of support behind me,47231,1760,2019-01-29 07:21:34,"My ex has women telling her on social media how amazing she is for raising kids in her own and how strong and independent she is for picking herself up after the divorce (that she caused with her affair) and being a mom. I have none of that. Its not that my friends don't think I'm a good dad, its that as a society, we have made the single mom a sort of unsung hero. What about single dads?  We do the same shit. I work and take care of my kids the same way but I don't get celebrated like I'm doing something amazing. I just get the recognition that almost all dads get...nothing. 

Edit - thanks for the silver and gold people. I hope this was for agreeing with the premise and not because I sounded like I wanted a cookie for being a dad. It may have sounded like I wanted credit for some shit I'm supposed to do. 

That's not the case. I've been to mom groups to socialize my kids and I'm this weird anomaly and they don't even talk to me so then I play with my kid so I'm not just there on my phone. Its not the same for us. We don't have the same resources. Although some of you have suggested some that I hadn't heard of. 

Anyway, my struggle is the lack of equality, not the lack of attaboy and I think that may be how it came across. Thanks for all your support and for making me feel like I'm doing good as a parent. 


Edit 2 - Well this blew up. I'd like to say that I really appreciate the kind words of me being a good single dad. Thanks again for platinum, gold, and silver. To those that disagree or say ""man up,"" that's why I put this in unpopular opinions. Not everybody agrees and that's just fine. 

As has been repeatedly pointed out, I know I'm not a full time single parent. I'm still a single parent for a week at a time and sometimes its bad ass and super rewarding cause my kids are the shit. Sometimes its hard. Just like it is for parents in a couple, part time custody, or full time custody. I can't imagine doing it completely on my own 24/7 and those people get major props. ",0

( https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/millennials-earn-20-percent-less-than-boomersdespite-being-better-educated.html )

•	Cost of college has gone up at 8 times the rate of wages 
( https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/07/24/price-of-college-increasing-almost-8-times-faster-than-wages/#6ba328a466c1 )

•	There is not one single state in the United States where a full-time, just-above-minimum-wage job can support a 1 bedroom apartment 
( https://www.businessinsider.com/minimum-wage-worker-cant-afford-one-bedroom-rent-us-2018-6 ). 

•	Student loans now make up the largest chunk of non-housing debt in America, and many ""entry level"" jobs now require a degree.
( https://www.finder.com/student-loans-account-for-36-35-of-non-housing-debt )

•	Cost of living is up 300% or more since the 1970s but wages are only up 50-70%. 


For example, the Bureau of Census reports that the average price of a new home in June 1998 was $175,900.

According to inflation, that price today should be $271,931. The same report places the average sale price for June 2018 at $368,500, however, more than 35% higher than the price when accounting for inflation alone. 

A gallon of gas in 1994 cost $1.06, making it $1.64 in June 2014, when adjusted for inflation. The actual national average price, as of July 2018, is $2.88 – 75% higher than what it would be if inflation were the only cause for the increase.

The median household income in 1998 was $38,885. The most recent year with full data available is 2017, so adjusting for inflation as of that year gives a median income of $58,487. The Bureau of Census reports that the actual median 2017 income was $59,000 – higher than the adjusted figure, but not by very much, and certainly nowhere near the percentage that prices have outpaced inflation.

This did not happen by accident - this happened because of greed. CEO salary and shareholder profits have outstripped wages and cost of living by a factor of between 3 and 8 depending on the source you read. 

Millennials TRULY have it harder than our parents did.

•	We cannot afford to ""put ourselves through school"" working a part time job - they could. 

•	We cannot afford to have one parent stay at home - they could. 

•	We cannot afford to buy a house on a single income - they could. 

And yet, Boomers have the audacity to tell us that we need to just work harder, pull ourselves up by our boot straps. That we're lazy and entitled. 

No, we're not. The data shows that Millennials work just as hard as our parents generation, but we struggle more. 

For years now, when Boomers have told us, ""you're lazy and entitled"" and we need to ""just work harder"", we've tried to explain this to them - and they don't listen. 

We learned that there's no point in trying to convince them - nothing will change their mind. So now we just say, ""OK boomer"".

Young men are dropping out of society because it's abundantly clear nobody gives a shit about them,46453,11716,2020-02-05 22:01:04,"The majority of homeless people are men. The majority of suicide deaths are men. Young men graduate college less than young women. Young women are out-earning young men. Single women are more likely to own a home than single men. There are gross discrepancies in the amount of government aid available to men and that available to women.

Yet I've never seen women marching to end male homelessness. I've never heard a radio ad about raising money for prostate cancer. I've never seen a commercial asking men if maybe it's time to give college a second chance. Literally, nobody cares if you live or die. Nobody cares if you're educated or fulfilled. Nobody cares about you.

And you will be openly mocked, belittled, and humiliated if you don't fit into the predefined social mold that exists for men. Homeless? Fuck off. Small dick? Haha. Suicidal? Ew.

Why bother trying to be part of society that at best ignores you, and at worst is openly antagonistic towards you? I've seen so many articles like this: ""Why are young men dropping out? It must be because educated women scare them."" They always come to the same, obtuse, and illogical conclusions. ""Men are just stupid/lazy/useless/onerous in some way, I guess. Women are better anyways.""

Young men are dropping out because they are treated by society like actual, literal disposable objects. That's the real reason.

Edit: To everyone asking me in the comments why women should be responsible for helping men, this is the reason: Feminism by its literal definition is about fostering gender equality. If men are disproportionately negatively affected by things like homelessness, violence, a lack of education, and presumptions of criminality, then these are inherently feminist issues. If you are a feminist that doesn't care about male problems, then *you are not a feminist.*",0
Men don't conceal their depression because they are afraid being seen as less of a man. They conceal because no one gives a fuck.,46201,3120,2019-11-27 22:04:35,"As Bill Burr once said 'ladies your issues may not get resolved but at least people give a fuck'. 

And its true. Women have support systems for their depression, they have systems in place and people are much more prone to be sympathetic to women and don't want to see a woman suffering, people want to help and show they are not alone.


But for men we are alone, partially because of the traditional view that men cannot show weakness, but the biggest reason is no one cares. People don't just not care they distance themselves from you. Men and women will just walk away or show a miniscule amount of compassion. Men know that expressing our depression or darker thoughts is a terrible idea because it will make matters worse, not better. 


There is this modern trend that traditional gender roles cause men not to talk about this, I think that's a small component of the reason, but its because most of us know if we come forward with our issues, the people around us and society at large will largely shun us. Therefore we bottle it in and deal with it by ourselves, not because we are afraid of not looking like ""real men"" but because we know we are alone in this struggle and if we open up we will lose so, so much.",0

Social media was one of the worst things humans have created,46185,1951,2020-08-23 18:08:08,"Social media was introduced as a way to communicate with friends or classmates and other strangers. Now, it seems that social media is one of the worst things ever. Twitter has become a prime place for lots of beef and drama and other nonsensical conversations. Tiktok really is just for people to simp over hot girls doing dances. Instagram is where everyone likes to post their whole life story, and these people always have problems with stalkers and other complications with the lack of privacy. I could go on but I'm really over it. Social media will never be the same and this really sickens me because there's a lot of good on twitter and instagram, but these platforms get completely drowned out by all the bad.

Edit: Well this blew up. I'd like to clarify that I don't think the concept of social media is bad, but I do have a huge problem with how we use social media. Reddit is no exception to the toxicity of the modern media.",0
Saying a white kid looks like a school shooter is just as racist as saying a black kid looks like a thug,46167,5780,2020-05-02 02:10:35,"We’ve all heard the joke, someone sees a quiet, nerdy white kid with long hair and they say something like “major school shooter vibes” or something like that. I have always found this incredibly racist. I think it’s the equivalent of saying that a young black kid looks like a thug or gangster, something that I’m certain would offend most of the people on this subreddit.

Saying an introverted white kid looks like a shooter is both racist and a form of really nasty bullying, and we should all just stop with it. It’s not really something to joke about anyways.",0

But if you actually dress up as a baby and shit your diaper and get your rocks off to this, or pretend to be an animal and get off on fucking animals or babies, even if they are just 'pretend animals' and 'pretend babies', then it goes beyond a normal fetish and into the realm of mental illness. 

Calling someone out for basically being into pedophilia or bestiality and hiding it as a fetish or kink that should be understood and respected isn't 'kinkshaming', it's just being a concerned citizen and perfectly fine.",0
"Everyone SHOULD feel unsafe and alert when walking the streets at night. It's not oppression, it's a necessary survival instinct.",45912,4513,2020-08-17 20:55:02,"Mentally twisted, ill, fucked up people will always exist, and both women and men need to have the appropriate psychological and physiological response to prepare for such a threat, particularly when we are alone and vulnerable in the dark. Striving for a world where women (or more generally, **everyone**) can roam freely at night is unrealistic.

I regularly hear that women should not have to feel unsafe walking alone at night, as a result of the patriarchy and men preying on vulnerable women. Apparently it's a common assumption that men do not feel this pressure whatsoever, which is entirely bullshit. Everyone **should** feel this way when walking alone at night. Anything can happen to anyone.

I'm a white male and have been assaulted walking home from work last year, when a group of drunk men asked me to have a drink with them, I declined and they yelled slurs at me and threw empty glass bottles at me. One of my male school friends, who is a bodybuilder, was stabbed walking late at night.

We *all* feel that way because we need to be psychologically and physiologically prepared to flee a threat. Sketchy, fucked up people will always exist, unfortunately. They prey on vulnerable targets, and night time is the peak for these twisted fucks as it is isolated and dark, and when most are drunk.

If we hypothetically reach a state where people can feel entirely safe walking alone at night, they are more vulnerable and unsuspecting to possible attacks. We need to be alert. It's our natural response to trying to stay the fuck alive.

Edit: I probably used 'unsafe' and 'alert' interchangeably when they have different meanings. This is poor phrasing on my behalf, what I mean is that we should be alert. We shouldn't feel unsafe at all times, but rather we should recognise that the environment can be unsafe. ",0
Showering at night is better than showering in the morning,45880,2774,2020-08-24 17:50:12,"Showering at night ensures you won't get into bed with your day's sweat and dirt and so your sheets will be cleaner plus you yourself would feel more relaxed going to sleep.

"I dont care how well behaved your dog is, put it on a leash.",45686,3440,2020-03-27 17:08:50,"A few months ago, while walking my dog outside, an off leash dog approached. What was only probably 5 seconds felt like a lifetime. This off leash husky ran over, with his owner about 30 FT away,  attacked my greyhound in the jugular, stomach, butt, and all four legs. After the attack, my husband walked our dog to the nearest vet, as blood pumped with every beat from my dogs chest. For 3 tenths of a mile the sidewalk was covered in blood and all the while the other dog owner kept saying ""shes so friendly, she never does this."" He continued to say that to the vet and the police. My dog was in emergency surgery and was bit 3 veins off the jugular. He was so close to not making it and I was stuck with a $6000 bill that I had to pay if I wanted him to live. No the other dog owner didn't pay, and I have to go through the trouble of suing him. 
There are leash laws for a reason. I don't care if your dog is ""friendly"" and ""well behaved"". Put it on a leash. If something happens, you're entirely at fault. 
I now carry a taser after what happened. Keep your dog safe, and keep them on a leash. People like me are out there, with tasers, ready to protect their dog. Be responsible. Its literally the easiest thing you can do.
    
EDIT: Wow, thank you for the awards. Thank you everyone who sent me warm messages. I didn't expect this to take off like it did and I'm so happy with the response. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Father's Day shouldn't be about single moms. They have Mother's Day.,45674,3107,2020-06-21 22:12:59,"Something that annoys me so much is when you see people wishing the moms who had to be the mom and the dad for their child/children a Happy Father's Day. Father's Day is a time to appreciate the dads that were there for their kids, so why should we take away from that by making this day about moms too? Mother's Day is the day that's meant for that. If the roles were reversed and we were doing this for single dads on Mother's Day, people would freak out.

Edit: To clarify, I have no problem with someone's kid wishing them both a Happy Father's Day and a Happy Mother's Day, since it's their kid. My problem is adults trying to MAKE other people wish single parents both.

Second Edit: For all the people who still dont understand, if someone's child wants to wish their single mom a Happy Father's Day, go for it. What annoys me is the people who try to make Father's Day about single moms and take away attention from good dads who were there for their children",0
"Science is a really fun subject, but the combination of a poorly made curriculum and a boring teacher is the reason alot of students hate science.",45665,1777,2020-07-21 08:14:46,"Science is by far the most interesting subject as it is the study of the smallest things in the universe all the way to the biggest and brightest things. It also teaches how the universe works and how things on earth work. However the reason many students find it boring is because the curriculum doesn't do a good job at explaining these things and instead teaches very specific things rather then a summary of the subject. If it wasn't this way then it would make kids want to further learn about their preferred science. 

And in my personal experience, and from what I've seen online, most people get sucky teachers who don't do a good job at making science fun.",0
Disney is overrated and people are brainwashed into loving it more than they should.,45659,2166,2020-03-14 16:53:34,"There is no legitimate reason why best animated film is going to Disney every single year, almost without fail, since the award was invented in 2001. 2017 is probably the best example for this. The two greatest animated films that year were Loving Vincent and the Breadwinner. Loving Vincent was revolutionary in terms of medium, having each frame be a full oil painting. It also told a beautiful story and the cinematography was magnificent. Breadwinner was also a magnificent story about a Middle Eastern girl searching for her father. Either of these films should have won best animated picture, but they didn't. They lost to Coco. Don't get me wrong, Coco was good, almost great even. But it was nowhere near as revolutionary nor as important a story as Loving Vincent or the Breadwinner. Coco won simply because it was Disney Pixar. The only reason Disney is winning every year is because they are overrated and super well known, whereas these other films are indie films. But the best picture shouldn't go to a film because of the company that produces it, but rather because of the quality and importance of the films itself. Indie films and 2d animated films continually get stumped by Disney for best animated picture. In fact, only once did a 2d film win, and only once did a foreighn film win, and that one time for both of those was when Spirited Away won in 2002. Never again has a 2d or foreign film won, and never has an indie film won. 

Disneyland is a fucking scam. It's a 1984 community that feels so eerily unsettling and inhuman. They brainwash people with their slogans like ""happiest place on earth"" and they cover up anything bad from their audience. Not to mention the corporate greed, and the continuous raising of prices for tickets. Disney also own half of Anaheim city, and most of the nearby hotels and motels are secretly owned by Disney. Some goes for the nearby gas stations, diners, etc. Disney pretty much runs the city of Anaheim in secrecy, and the Anaheim government is perfectly fine with that because they get big paychecks out if it. Disneyland isn't even as great as everyone says it is. The only reasons people go so much is because people are sad, and where better to go than what is advertised as the ""happiest place on earth""? People take their kids there because they think that their kids have to go to Disneyland at least once to have a good quality childhood. People I know seem to go to Disneyland often simply to show how fucking rich and well off they are. They're using Disneyland as a way to express their higher class, not as a way to actually enjoy themselves. Walt Disney imagined a Utopia, but it seems to me that he got a Dystopia instead. He wanted to use his money for good, for human progress in technology, but instead the company hoards it and just uses the money to get even more money. Imagine the good charity that the company could do with their money. That is what Walt wanted. He wanted money for the people, not for the corporation.

Working at Disney is terrible. If you work in animation, any drawing you produce at the time, whether on duty or not, are the property of Disney. This prevents people from being able to do freelance or to work for other companies at the same time. (This also means that theres vaults of cartoon porn that Disney owns because the artists draw shit like that for shits and giggles). If you work at Disneyland, they treat you like shit and they don't pay well either. But hey, you get free tickets, so it's all good (sarcasm). Disney oppresses their employees and they get away with it all the time because they have big money. 

Disney is continuously fighting their competition until they win, and they almost alwats win. And by competition, I don't mean enemies, but allies too. This can be seen in the Sony argument where Disney continually demands more and more, until smaller companies have to give in because they know that they can't make it opposing such a powerful entity. This is what happened with Spiderman, as Disney got greedy and started demanding more profits and Sony said no, so Disney broke off their deal until Sony finally gave in because they'd make even less money if they cut ties with Disney all together than if they gave them most of the profits for Spiderman. This bullshit has been pulled off so many times by Disney.

Disney is taking over the film industry and the marketing industry and it pisses me off so much that almost everyone is just ok with that. Disney also keeps producing films that stump smaller films in awards because the game is rigged in favor of bigger entities. Movies like Frozen, Brave, the Incredibles, etc are only popular because of the company that is making them, not because of the quality of the films itself. People expect a Disney film to be good, and oftentimes people's opinions will be biased based on what they go in expecting. People need to support smaller companies and indie companies more often than they do, before there aren't any left to support.",0
Adults who are obsessed with Disney are kind of creepy.,45585,3183,2020-10-03 08:26:15,"Disney obsessed people tend to say they enjoy the magic and fairytales, but that just feels like denial of how terrible real life is. So instead of working together and fixing life, they spend hundreds, even thousands going to parks, buying merchandise, and watching movies over and over.

Also, Disney is pretty much geared towards kids and being crazy about it is sorta creepy. It just seems like these people have experienced a failure to launch. People should grow up and stop expecting life to be a fairytale.

Kids should be able to claim back a percentage of the money that their influencer parents earned while exploiting them on YouTube,44495,864,2020-06-04 03:25:51,"Sometimes the mommy vlog world just makes me sick, between the Stauffer family ""re-homing"" the difficult special needs child they adopted from a third world country because it was ""too much"", and the vapid nature of the Ace family and their sketchy philanthropic endeavours, it feels like children are turning into commodities instead of being nurtured and cared for as vulnerable minors.

In a lot of children's shows like Peppa Pig the fathers are consistently portrayed as bumbling idiots and the mothers as awesome heroines saving the day and it sends a very wrong message to little kids,44460,4157,2019-03-07 21:05:23,"Like in virtually every show aimed towards little kids, the girls are heroic, the boys foolish.

A lot of kids shows are like this. The father figures are weak, the mother figures all-knowing.

Its time we start to distinguish ourselves from other medical professions. Scrubs are for nurses. Labcoats are for doctors (and actual lab people).

It should be a requirement for pharmacists to wear capes to distinguish ourselves from others. There is no practical reason for wearing capes, I’ll admit, but neither is there a practical reason to wear a labcoat.

Additionally, I’m tired of being summoned to help a customer (probably with something incredibly stupid, obvious, or boring) without making a grander entrance. If I had a cape, I could briskly walk towards the costomer and come to a quick stop and allow the cape to flow up and consume me a little before I begin to speak.

I would want to do the cliche vampire reveal thing using one arm to hold half the cape in front of me and then toss it asside, but that would be very unprofessional.

Additional comments:
1) Yes, I am technically a doctor because I have a doctorate. You know what I meant though.
2) A lot of people doubting I am a pharmacist. I am indeed a pharmacist, but I was not put on this earth to argue with internet strangers so, idrc
3) Looks like there is a lot of support for capes here. Might try to make some shirts that push our edgy cape agenda. Might actually look into making custom capes. Thanks guys!

Nuclear energy is in fact better than renewables (for both us and the environment ),43250,4171,2020-02-11 19:47:00,"Hello everyone, this is gonna be a bit longer, so if you are not interested in a long read, feel free to scroll to **TLDR.** 

So to begin with, I believe a bit of background about myself is appropriate so that people have an idea about where this all comes from. I am 24, just finishing my master's degree in inorganic chemistry this year. Ever since I was little, I have always been baffled regarding the opinions many people had about such issues. I ended up in a lot of fights with people who were also very concerned about the environment over the years, which mostly didn't achieve much, which has really troubled me because the facts are clear, but for some unknown reason (at the time) no one seemed to get it. The goal of this post is to get it off me and hopefully show as many people as possible, what the reality is. I will try to distinguish as clearly as possible among the pure data and my own opinions in this piece. By no means am expert in this field, but I have a decent understanding of all the field which play the part in this (thermodynamics, electrical engineering, energy sources, and a bit of high energy physics).

The first thing people should understand is the basics of energy distribution. Our entire energy grid is the result of the fact that energy generation is an extremely inefficient process (in a common power grid around 68% of energy is lost before it gets to your home). Every means (apart from solar panels)  is dependent on a generator that generates electricity by Faraday's Law of Induction. Without getting technical, what happens is that when you move magnets and conductors next to one another, electricity is generated. What happens in the reality that some sort of fuel produces gasses (commonly water vapor, which has very good properties for this) that spin a massive machine with magnets around a huge coil. This machine is a state of the art, costs loads of money and all of that is worth it to not lose as much energy as we would otherwise. The rest of the grid is made to accommodate this. Electricity is made in huge power plants because they are more efficient than small ones distributed more densely. To reduce the losses in transmission, all the power is converted to very high voltages, which itself costs billions in infrastructure and maintenance.

We have established, that all we need from the fuel is to spin the rotor (the moving part of the generator).  So which one is the best? As in everything in life, there are trade-offs, but some combinations are definitely better than others.

**Here is a small overview of common energy sources.**

* Solar energy - one outsider (there is no spinning involved). It is surprisingly bad for nature, the manufacturing and disposal of solar panels are very dirty and energy-intensive.  They also have a very short life, high volatility (both throughout the year and wether depending) and not the best efficiency. The only reasonable use of solar panels, in my opinion, is to put in on rooftops for house heating or in 3rd world countries where infrastructure doesn't give any alternatives.
* Wind energy - apart from destroying the landscape, it is also very volatile. In contrary to popular opinion, very fast winds are actually not a good thing, is it strains the bearings (greatly simplified) and has to be actually slowed down. What you want are consistent faster winds. The efficiency if good, up to 40 %
* Geothermal energy - sadly not very viable on a large scale, but with good geothermal sources very very good. You basically get pressurized steam (there are lots of types, let us omit the technicalities), that you don't have to do much with before pushing into the generator.
* Fossil fuels - Coal, Natural gas, Oil - They are very dirty. And I mean very very dirty. Depending on the coal used (varies a lot) it actually often produces more radioactive waste than nuclear powerplants (scary, I know). That waste is either ash or gets dispersed in the exhaust from the plant. Mostly radioactive carbon, uranium, and thorium. The sad thing is we need these plants. They are the only ones that can quickly react to energy needs and basically stabilize the entire grid. At around 35 efficiency, depending on many factors, they are not a huge win, but cheap, versatile provide most of the electricity.
* Nuclear power - Most of the people don't understand where the energy comes from, so this will be a quick walkthrough. Many have you know or have seen the famous equation by Einsteins E = mc^(2), what it means is that there is some sort of equivalency between energy and mass. And that is exactly where nuclear energy is from. A very small amount of mass is converted into huge amounts of energy when the atoms are split. It has many disadvantages such as nuclear waste, constant output, very high building costs, etc, but it produces clean energy (yeah, hard to believe, I will talk about in detail below) and very low price.

Here is where the comparison between renewables and nuclear comes. Unpopular fact is that nuclear energy is about 2x- 3x cleaner than solar and wind. Most of the difference comes down to the fact that building windmills and solar panels is expensive, energy-demanding, resources demanding, they don't last very long, but most importantly they produce very little energy for all that. The nuclear power plant is very expensive to build, but after that, it produces very little waste (more on this later) and a huge amount of energy. If we were to calculate in the cost of manufacturing and disposal of these power sources and normalize it to the energy output, it turns out that it produces around 2-3 times less CO2 while being significantly cheaper. E.g. if we were to replace a nuclear power plant by renewables, we would both hurt the nature and pay twice the money for it (while not including in that the nuclear plant is built already).

Many people have a large number of concerns about anything that contains the word ""nuclear"". This personally saddens me, as I believe it comes partly from not understanding and partly from the media turning it into the big thing. For instance, MRI that we all know from hospitals are ""correctly"" called NMR standing for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, but people were scared of it being called nuclear and just turned down the procedure without even listening, so they call it MRI instead, it still works the same.

**To quickly comment on most common fears about nuclear plants:**

* It will explode! - Well, there is always a small possibility, the problem is that people are terrible with big numbers and statistics. In reality, nuclear plans are immensely safe nowadays, with great oversight and many precautions, a catastrophic failure is pretty much a non-issue
* But Chernobyl!?!?!?! - It isn't actually such a big deal as media make it. I am not saying it wasn't a true tragedy, but objectively it isn't something that could possibly happen in a modern power plant. Everything went pretty much as poorly as possible. Approximately 4000 people have died as a result. Well, the flu kills 10 000 people only in the USA annually. Estimated traffic deaths around the world are about 1 250 000 people annually. Does Chernobyl seem that bad now?
* The nuclear waste is a terrible thing - well yes and not. You see, radioactivity is very natural, even bananas are slightly radioactive (they contain potassium). Nuclear waste is encased in huge casks, made out of steel, concrete, etc. It isn't something that just leaks radiation everywhere, they are immensely durable, safe and well maintained. Most of the people have never been to the nuclear powerplant, I have been to the reactor itself. Without any protection, you can just walk above the pool with the nuclear waste that is hot and fresh from the reactor (excursion are allowed to people working/studying the field, while the reactor is in maintenance to change fuel pellets). The radiation isn't much and just water (yeah, just regular water) can pretty much contain it. All that happens is that the water is a bit blueish

**What people usually don't understand about renewables:**

* Manufacturing of renewables is no ""green"", not it the slightest - Silicon isn't as clean to make, it's not just sand. Phosphorous isn't either. Titanium coating? Aluminum? I am not against chemical, not in the slightest, you just have to. But purifying the silicon takes energy. A lot of energy so does other stuff. And disposing of them is hell.
* Wind and solar do help one another, but they are still immensely volatile, dependant on the part of the year and local weather. If you have a little bit of them, it's ok. But if you start to add serious amount of them in the electric grid, it becomes a problem. You see, energy consumption is not always the same and we have to be able to react to it. So we want to make energy when we need it, not when it pleases. This is the reason huge pump-storage hydro facilities exist. They use overflow nuclear electricity during the night to pump water up and in the highest demand produce some of the electricity back.
* Renewables are non-scalable. As you add more turbines there are only worse and worse spots, you need huge batteries to defend the grid from their volatility, huge ones, you would run out of lithium to cover entire worlds needs. Truth is, it just isn't happening.
* All of these are not imaginary statements. They are real. Let's have a look at an example. France vs Germany. Both of these are wealthy countries where people care about the environment. But they took very different routes. Germany went renewable. Mostly wind, some solar. About 35 % of their total energy is renewable, so how are they doing? Their energy is expensive. Very expensive. Twice the price of France's energy. So at least they are not producing CO2 right? Well, they do. A lot more than France. Even if you normalize it on energy produced. And the worst thing is that the gap is getting bigger! Why? Because renewables just can't scale efficiently anymore. So what did the Frace do right? Why is it cheaper and cleaner? Nuclear energy. France gets almost 72% of energy from nuclear, the highest in the world. And it turns out it works.

**So what about the future then? It all looks so grim.**

Well, again yes and no. Let me state that the proposed solution is to largely my own idea, but I believe it is firmly based in reality and will most likely be the way it goes. We will continue to heat up the planet in the foreseeable future. We would have to basically give up the civilization otherwise. The best way would be to have as much energy from nuclear energy as possible, use other sources where it makes sense and simply wait until fusion is ready. WHICH IT WILL BE! Get ready to get excited :)

So fusion is in some way a opposite of nuclear power plants. What happens there is that heavy atoms are split using neutrons. We call this ""Fission"". What fusion does it the exact opposite. It uses light elements and fuses them together, which converts mass into energy. The great news about it is that it is using hydrogen (deuterium and tritium- two isotopes that aren't so common but still easy to get from oceans and lithium to cover humanity for thousands of years). There is no possibility of an explosion, not even theoretical. No waster. Just clean and pure energy.

Well, that sounds awesome? Why don't we have it yet? The thing is, its not quite that simple. There are more models etc by for sake of simplicity what we pretty much need to do is create a small sun (yep, the sun is using hydrogen as fuel and makes helium as a ""waste""(helium from helios, which means sun in ancient greek)). But in the last decade, fusion energy has come a long way and with ITER being finished in 5 years approximately, the fun will start. ITER is a most expensive project ever to be built in human history and it will be the first fusion reactor that will work and produce energy (it is still for research, but will be net positive). Where does all of my certainty come from? I have been to some lectures from the CERN physicists about fusion as well as a big fan for years. Fusion is a huge technological challenge, but all the fields required have immensely advanced and that is why it will succeed. The fusion is simple if you can use gravity, the fuel just presses itself and fusion beings. Well.... that isn't an option for us so what will we do.  We take a very very very hot plasma (millions of degrees) and compress it, this makes fusion start, but starting it isn't the problem, sustaining is. It is so hot, that you need to hold it ""levitating"" in the electromagnetic field, you have to control huge temperature gradients (changes in temperature over short distances). There are numerous challenges for which you need huge and powerfull magnets, incredible shielding, superconducting cables, high energy physics, the physics of hot plasma, very advanced robotics for maintenance, etc. but it will happen. With a clean source of cheap energy, a lot of problems we have will have very good solutions and I am very much looking forward to it. We have our best people on in, way smarter and more dedicated than you or I.

This has stretched out more than I expected without really getting into the details. If this thread catches on, I might expand it while reply to some of the interesting questions. Thanks, everyone for reading

&#x200B;

**TLDR**: Renewable resources are not scalable in reality and will never fulfill the needs of humanity. The sad reality is that nowadays we are using mostly fossil fuels and heading to the direction that doesn't have a promising future. Nuclear energy is vastly cheaper while being 2-3x more ecofriendly that renewables, most of what people know or think they know about these sources is grossly misplaced and media are only feeding into it. These aren't just theoretical thoughts but the reality of current France and Germany is the best example. France has almost three-quarters of its energy from nuclear and is 2nd best (eco-wise) country in the world. (1st from only energy standpoint). It produces way less CO2 per kW energy than Germany (this disparity is only increasing) while having around twice as cheap energy.

**EDIT:** As many people have brought up a couple of things I will go over them quickly:

* ***Nuclear plant safety:*** Just to give an idea of what would have to happen for a nuclear plant to explode. **Gravity would have to stop working**. The reactors are nowadays constructed in this way: The nuclear fuel is in vertical rods in the reactor covered with water. Above it, huge control rods hang on electromagnets. In the case of anything happening the control rods will be released and fall into the reactor. There, they will absorb the neutrons which cause the fission and stop the reaction in seconds. They can be used to control the reaction by partially lowering them into the reactor, which will slow the radioactive fission.
* ***Nuclear waste***: This indeed is a problem, but not very different than people imagine. It is pretty much just ok to bury it a couple km underground in a stable location. It isn't the best solution, in theory, we could just launch it to the sun, but when we are talking about the alternatives. Nuclear waste really doesn't pose a problem. Nowadays it is stored mostly in the plants themselves. The pellets and loaded into a container, covered with concrete and then have multiple other layers on top. You can literally walk around the container and unless you are there every day nothing will happen.
* ***Thorium reactors instead of uranium***\*\*:\*\* Thorium is a very similar element to uranium. It has been brought up by many people and is argued to be safer which is partly true but doesn't really make a difference in reality. I t is trued that thorium is theoretically superior to uranium with greater abundance ( around 3x much), easier use, etc. The main problem is that the uranium nuclear plant technology is well-matured and researched. It would take decades for all the research and prototyping for thorium to be finished for it to become widespread. As we have enough uranium for the foreseeable future, I think we should rather use the money to boost fusion research. By the time we run out of uranium, it will be likely so warm, that it doesn't matter anymore unless fusion is adopted.

**EDIT 2:** As many people have brought mentioned land contaminated by Chernobyl and [SunnyBunnyBunBun](https://www.reddit.com/user/SunnyBunnyBunBun/) did a great job going through some of the facts here it is. Furthermore oceans will rise and take more land if we don't stop global warming. We cant revert the past, but we can influence the future.

To generate 1 MegaWatt of electricity, here's how much land you'd need using these energy sources:  
\- coal: 12 acres  
\- natural gas: 12 acres  
\- nuclear: 12 acres  
\- solar: 43 acres ! (\~4x as much!)  
\- wind: 70 acres !! (\~6x as much!)  
\- hydro: 315 acres !!! (\~26x as much!!!)

Inefficient? And that's WITHOUT counting the production of the materials involved and the disposal of them once they need to be replaced (like you said, solar panels are made from Silicon. Making them or disposing of them is NOT a green process.)

Once you count everything involved in production in, the numbers EXPLODE. From MIT's report, here are the overall land requirements for each energy type, if 100% of the electricity in the US were produced by these sources:

\- Solar - 33,000 sq. km  
\- Wind - 66,000 sq. km  
\- Nuclear - 440 sq. km

That's not a typo. Solar takes up 75x MORE space than nuclear, and wind an astonishing 150x more. This is not inconsequential. This is land and its wildlife that is affected.

Pixar fucked up the first 10 minutes of UP.,42690,1237,2020-05-03 18:59:50,"There. I said it. It's been bugging me for 11 years. People keep going on and on about those first ten minutes like they are the pinnacle of animation. But in my mind, I think Pixar basically botched what *could've been* one of the actual greatest animated moments. I feel like those 10 minutes were always meant to be shown in the *middle* of the film. Almost as if they decided to make that sequence the opening as an afterthought.   


Throughout the first half of the film, Carl doesn't really open up to Russell; and we don't really know why he's so keen to get to Paradise Falls or why he cares so much about a stupid house (except we do know since we watched the opening). Eventually, we get a scene where Carl alone enters the broken house and takes out an old photo album, basically giving us another mini-version of the first ten minutes. I'm convinced that in an earlier draft of the script, the opening 10 minutes where intended to be shown during this scene. And I believe that if it had played out like that, the moment would've been 10 times more powerful than it is in the final film. Because then everything would click, suddenly we would understand why this stubborn old man behaved the way he did. The buildup would make that emotional punch much stronger.  


But the way the film is now; we go into the movie seeing a montage about a character we are yet to  care about; and throughout the entire film we know everything about Carl's life and motivations, making his reserved and introverted character pointless since we already understand. It would've served better as a reveal later on.

"If you need religion to not be horrible person, and to stop you from doing horrible things, then you are a terrible person.",42281,2782,2020-06-16 16:46:13,"Hear me out.

I've been thinking about this opinion for a while now ever since I've hit my teenage years. This is because my mom always tells me ""If it weren't for god I would've **\[*****insert messed up action*****\]*****\****"". So when I got older, I realized just how messed up that actually is.

The reason as to why it is messed up  is because you should be a good person based on your own moral code, not religion. What if that religion never existed? What would you do if you all of a sudden didn't like religion anymore? What would you do then? Would you go, and kill people? Would rob banks? Would you do all the horrible things you wanted to do previously?

Those who think this way usually don't even know or care for the reason *why* they shouldn't do horrible things. They only seem to not do awful things only because they think that something bad will happen to them, based upon their religious belief.

*Now to clarify, this isn't to say that I hate people who believe in religion, or think all people who use religion in their life think this way (although, I do personally despise religion, as it has caused a lot of trouble in my life). This is to say that I think if you use religion as your entire reason for not doing awful shit, then you aren't a good person in my eyes.*

**\*Note: Some of the things my mother has said were REALLY bad. She even said that she would've killed me and my siblings by now if it weren't for god. Yeah.......Really. Smh.**

**Edit: WAY too many people keep saying that I think all people who are religious, think this way. Not true. I'm talking about a sizable amount of religious people who refrain from evil deeds simply because they fear harsh consequences based on their own religion.** ***I repeat not all people think this way, but a sizable amount of people do.***

**Edit 2: Displaying my opinion the internet isn't edgy.**

**Edit 3: Don't disregard what I say simply because of my age. If you think this way, you're being closed minded.**

**Final Edit: This is a nuanced topic, so there is a lot of room to debate here. I'm okay with that. However, please try to be respectful to others in this thread, and don't attack, and insult people for their own beliefs on the matter. Everyone should try to learn something from thread about humanity, morality, and religion as a whole. Thanks for teaching me a few things here guys, I appreciate it. That being said, may the debate continue!**",0

Women sexualize themselves then blame men for sexualizing women,41889,8537,2020-02-19 21:32:34,"One trip to Instagram and you'll see women flaunting their bodies everywhere, embracing it.

They don't have to be popping out your turtleneck for us to appreciate them.

Now I'm not saying that you deserve to be sexually harassed on the street, or cat called. That's not my intentions with this post. What I'm saying is that there are plenty of women who enjoy sexualizing themselves and embracing their body so when a guy comments like ""damn you're so thick!"" with 3 fire emojis, you can't just call him a ""misogynist pig who should stop objectifying women!""

It’s not racist to say Chinese citizens need to tighten up their food standards and stop eating low-grade meats.,41753,4183,2020-01-31 05:47:31,"There are a lot of racist sentiments floating around as a result of the coronavirus spread, but this is not one of them.

This isn’t the first outbreak caused by exposure to rare and tainted meat that shouldn’t be eaten to begin with. 

Holding Chinese citizens accountable for poor food standards is not calling out a specific RACE. Chinese citizens come from all walks of life. There are white Chinese citizens, black Chinese citizens, asian, etc. All of them need to stop eating bats and wild, tainted animals. 

Same argument goes for banning flights, etc. The argument doesn’t target a race. It targets all races, genders, etc from a geographic location.",0

Paparazzis should be able to get charged for harassment and the invasion of privacy by celebrities.,41309,1430,2020-09-24 01:10:35,"There is nothing okay about photographing people in public without consent, the same should apply for celebrities.


Imagine, you have something that puts you in the public eye a lot, whether it’s your job or something to do with being part of a famous family. And one day you’re going for a walk in the park when suddenly someone starts following you and taking pictures of you before you can even make direct eye contact with them, just snapping photos of you like you’re some kind of landmark. What will they do with those photos? Who knows? Not like it’s any of your business, right?


Let’s put it in a different perspective. What if you aren’t a celebrity, you’re just some average joe on your way home. Would it be ok for someone to yell “hey! Smile! Ooh turn your head this way for me!” Whilst they start following and photographing you? Of course not, that’s pretty much the definition of an invasion of privacy. So why is it ok to do it to a celebrity? And how well known do you have to be for them to get away with it?


I genuinely hate the “oh well it’s just one of the side effects to being famous” answer. No job or occupation should make it okay for people to snap photos of you whilst in public and doing stuff outside work.


Even at movie premieres, the places paparazzis are actually expected to be at, they take it too far by practically chasing them around whilst they try to leave the theatres.

Also half the time it’s done without the person even knowing that they’re being photographed, such as those annoying articles nobody even cares about where they talk about what they saw Demi Lovato have at Starbucks the other day. Nobody should have permission to make someone’s personal life public to everyone when they’re just doing the same thing as everyone else. If I started following the guy who owns my local KFC and started posting pictures of them and writing articles about what they do in their free time on Facebook then I’d probably get called a stalker and get sued for harassment. But it’s fine if said person happens to be famous?

Hell, Princess Diana was indirectly killed by paparazzis because she got in a car crash whilst trying to get away from the swarm of people chasing her! Someone literally died because they were so focused on escaping a group of paid stalkers that their car ended up crashing.

Paparazzis are the literal scum of the earth, the bottom of the food chain. Only able to survive by latching onto people with more money so that they can document the stuff that should be private. They’re like secret spies, except, instead of finding out about the enemy’s secret weapons projects, they’re filming someone’s daily life as if they’re one of the animals on a BBC documentary.

Another thing that I hate is when they make it sound like the celebrity is totally in on it and is intentionally attracting paparazzis. For example: when a celebrity is pregnant they say something like “[insert name here] shows off growing baby bump during walk in [insert location]!” As if they’re getting up on a stage and telling everyone when actually they were just walking around whilst pregnant. A pregnant woman isn’t “showing off” her belly just because you can see it, she’s just walking around and *surprise surprise!* it’s not really easy to hide your belly when it’s growing a mini person inside it.


The whole thing about paparazzis and reporters just make my blood boil, whether it’s their annoying personality or their complete lack of respect for someone’s privacy.",0

I'd like to add a point that u/jarrodnb brought up. Reddit's attachments to memes and sayings lasts for far too long, which ends up making them unfunny, namely ""oof"", ""yikes"", and ""le"" (""Doggo"" and ""pupper"" fall in there too, but they weren't funny to begin with). Expanding on what I said in my reply to their comment, it's a weird communal flocking to what's trending in an attempt to be a cool, trendy person; but it's usually after the place the meme came from has moved on. It's wanting to be hip without actually expending the effort to find and participate in the source.",0
I'm a guy and I wish I could be pregnant,41270,6195,2019-08-29 01:06:32,"I think pregnancy is wonderful. I know it's not all lollipops and rainbows. I supported my wife every single day through her pregnancy and I helped her through the nausea, the body aches, and the terrible pain of giving birth. I know there are risks and complications and it's not something everyone wants to do. I wish I could do it, though.


My wife and I agreed we wanted a baby as soon as we had a house. Thankfully, she was able to become pregnant (I really feel for the women who can't have babies and wish they could) and we now have a toddler who is an absolute joy.


She loved being pregnant. Every day we talked about the baby growing in her womb that we couldn't wait to meet. I kissed her belly hundreds of times. And I fell in love with her all over again every time I looked at her. Her hand was pretty much glued to her belly, always rubbing it and humming a song. The bond that is formed between the mother and child is simply beautiful.


The hardest part about it is that I'll never be able to realize this wish and I never had a choice in the matter. Women can choose (in most cases) whether or not they want to become pregnant. And I don't know how the logistics of it all would work, anyway. Maybe if we lived in a world where both men and women were built with the capability to have babies, kind of like seahorses. I know it's not realistic, but if it were possible to give me a uterus transplant I'd consider it. I would go through considerable pain and effort if it meant I could get pregnant.


Every guy I've ever told has either looked at me like I'm insane or just straight-up laughed at me. Women I've told seem to understand, but nobody really takes it seriously except for my wife. She knows it's not a joke and that it's an actual dream of mine. Any guys out there agree with me?


Edit: Some people are rightfully pointing out that my wife's pregnancy went smoothly and that we are very fortunate. I do not disagree. However, I disagree that I have an idealized view of pregnancy. Just because things went well for her does not mean they would for me and does not mean they go well for others, but it also does not invalidate my feelings. As I stated above, I am well-informed of the risks that come with pregnancy.

Edit 2: No, it's not a sexual thing. Also, to clarify, I am happy as a straight male and I do not want to transition to become a woman.",0

Can Marvel shut the fuck up for like a decade at least?,41145,8449,2019-07-23 02:50:38,"They’re over-saturating the market to the extent that they’re really going to go the way of the Western at some point.

And, no, the positive reviews they keep getting really aren’t honest, and thats been getting more transparent in all the latest Marvel releases. 

From a craftsmanship perspective, they simply aren’t good films and have been barely nominated for technical awards. The stories are simplistic and very heavy on fan service and basic roller coaster action movie techniques. 

They’re almost identical to the Transformers movies, just with slightly better creative vision. 

No, I’m not the arbiter on what films are trash and what films are good, or anything, but the critics load up RT with fresh scores for every Marvel film with dozens of complaints about the films and just end up designating it “4 Stars” or “fresh” because “it’s fun, I guess” or “it’ll work for the audience it’s meant for”. These films are graded on a massive curve and the only reason people like them is because it’s in the zeitgeist to. 

Of all the franchises and stories that have become extremely successful across the decades, Marvel is the one that earned that success the least. It just pushes out constant, uninspired, artistically vacant films on a conveyor belt and calls them “new” and “creative” because they change up the setting a bit.

ProLife, ProChoice, whatever, more power to you. I’m just specifically saying if you ARE ProLife, you have to object in vitro fertilization.

IVF clinics trash more fertilized eggs a year than abortion clinics. The entire process is them fertilizing a certain amount of eggs, transplanting the ones least likely to have genetic problems into the mother, and tossing the rest and/or freezing them and then tossing them later if the parents decide not to try again. If you believe life begins at conception, i.e. fertilization, then any embryo that does not get implanted is murdered the same way an aborted embryo is murdered.

The only reason people don’t make a huge deal out of it like they do with Planned Parenthood or other family planning clinics is because it’s EXPENSIVE. It’s for upper middle class and above. Meanwhile, abortion is often seen as a lower class problem.

Example from my experience, I met G at the start of the school year and we became fast friends, she flirted with me a lot but a lot of people flirt with me so I ignored it, fast forward 3 months into the school year we hangin out after school while waiting for our rides and it snapped to me that I like her romantically.
After half a week I go up and ask her out but she goes ""I really liked you when we first met but not anymore"" then i ask what stopped her from asking me out and says ""Guys should be the ones asking us out"". We still close friends but yeah.

Maybe as I get older this would be different but why would the idea of guys going first be a normal thing",0
Just because we are live in Africa doesn’t mean we don’t have basic amenities,40456,4205,2020-05-23 18:17:36,"Hey guys, newbie here

I’m African and I’ve realized that whenever I start talking to someone online and I mention that I do in fact live in Africa, the entire conversation goes sideways and then it becomes “how do you have internet?” “ do you see lions frequently?” And other weird questions like that. And I’m not the only one who gets questions like that. 

My mum went to the USA a couple years back for an internship at a Montessori school. She still keeps in touch with one of the teachers there via email and Facebook. But last week when they were talking about ideas for online school during this pandemic, the lady still asked if there was access to electricity and internet in our community. My mum was quite irritated and she had to explain that yes, we have internet access in our homes and business and that’s how we’re able to use social media and email. 

I understand that the media in these places depicts Africa as a place where people wear leaves and hides and sleep in huts but don’t all continents have villages and rural areas?

Not everyone has to climb palm tree to get internet access and no, I have never seen a lion or a giraffe outside the zoo. In fact, i think the ‘wildest’ animal I’ve seen outside the zoo is a garden snake. 

Thank you. 
P.S. I’m new to reddit so please don’t judge me too harshly. Cheers:)

P.S: A lot of people have been asking why I say I’m from Africa instead of specifying where exactly. When I say Lagos, Nigeria, they always ask “where is that?” Then I say Africa and the questions follow.

P.P.S: there are a lot of things I’d like to clarify 

1. None of said conversation happened on Reddit, or during quarantine 
2. Lagos is not the capital of Nigeria 
3. If you’re saying a larger percentage of people in Africa don’t have internet access, you are correct. But if you are chatting with people over the internet then is it too much to assume that they aren’t part of that percentage?
4. It has come to my notice that this sub isn’t the perfect place for this post. No need to bite my head off, I shall crosspost 
5. For all you peaches who keep yelling “But Africa is POOR!!!” In the comments, no one said it wasn’t besides, it is rude to assume that the person on the other end of the phone or whatever is poor simply because they’re African and no decent human being should do that

Very often they just want you to read biased views until you have the same opinion as them. But they fail to understand that it’s not because you are uneducated, as they’re suggesting, but because you have looked at the facts and come to a different conclusion.

Edit: There are obviously some people who provide good sources to back up their viewpoints, but I’m not talking about them. Similarly I’m not talking about people who give statistics.

I’m on about people who make the general statement “educate yourself”. I’m also talking about people who give links to opinion pieces on reputable sites, or even sites with a straight up political bias like Breitbart or Vice.

Obviously if it’s in terms of a disease your doctor told you to research, or the infection rate of coronavirus then educate yourself is clearly meant in a sincere and objective way.

In highschool, she carried me through. I took my SATS and enrolled in community college. I felt like I actually had something. I was working toward a goal and it felt good. I was 17. 2 years later I applied to penn state branch in Abington PA. Went there for a semester and transferred over to Penn State university park in State College PA.

I was 21, 13,000 dollars in debt, and had 3 more semesters. I had my major lined up and started applying to internships. I busted my ass. I cried every night and felt terrible not gonna lie.

Now, I graduated in august of 2019 with 19,000 dollars in debt because community college was damn near free. I saved so much money doing 2 years there. I work as a financial analyst and make 57k a year working from 7-4 everyday and live in center city Philadelphia. I get home at 4:30 and have a comfortable apartment that I pay for and eat DAMN good meals. I’m tired but I love my life. I love the 8-9 hour shifts in my cubicle and I love that I graduated college. It worked for me.

It saddens me to see everyone shit on a 9-5 here on reddit. I assume the struggle isn’t bad to where you’re able to complain. I finally started my podcast now after work too. I get home and film from 5-5:30 and have almost 500 subs now. It gives me freedoms and flexibility and I’m almost done paying my loans too. I love it.

Edit 1: to everyone who’s asking, I went to Philadelphia’s community college. Yes north philly was horrible for my mental health and I now live in center city. I pay 950 a month for rent because it’s a 2 bedroom apartment for 3,000 dollars and I live with two other guys. We only have two bedrooms so we stated that the two guys who sleep in one room get to pay less. So I’m paying 950, the guy that lives in the same room as me pays 950, and the guy with his own room all to himself pays 1,100. They’re my boys and my best friends and help me with my podcast. I’m in a good place mentally. Also, yeah I was doing extremely terrible things as a kid. North philly doesn’t put you in a good mindset. I’m negative by default, so it was hard to get out. PM me for my podcast link. I don’t wanna be that asshole that just spams his post with his podcast lol. If you want to share it with friends and family and expand my growth and subscribers then PM me! Thanks!

Edit 2: okay so, this is so overwhelming thanks everyone for liking this post. I don’t know how to react at all to this. All I can say is Shoutout to all my fellow Philadelphians. Our birds are gonna kill it this year don’t even say they aren’t. my messages are blowing up and aren’t allowing me to answer anybody because my inbox is full. To everyone asking me.

Thanking God for something a human clearly did is a massive insult to that person.,39818,3097,2019-01-10 19:40:02,"I'm not sure if this is truly a massive unpopular opinion, but I've seen enough posts and comments online. I've had enough.

I have nothing against religion. You can believe whatever you (want to) believe in order to get through life and live your best one. However, critiquing others' - no matter how positively - by thanking a being we have no concrete proof exists for the doing of someone else is just a massive insult and injustice.

I've seen so many posts and comments on nice posts about how, for example, ""God is amazing for helping those doctors save that little girl, and for successfully giving her the surgery she needs"".

No. I don't care how real you think he is, God had nothing to do with that. Those men and women went to many years of medical school - where they learned from and were taught by other professionals, not God - and paid many dollars to get to where they are. God did not guide that person's hand; skill, knowledge, training, and *their* muscles did. God did not come down from the heavens. God did not pick up a scalpel and fix your child. God did not do that surgery. *They did*. And saying that God did is a massive insult to that person because it negates everything they've done in order to save someone. It completely ignores the effort, time, money, and passion they put into their career and life in order to save someone else's. *Especially* if that person is not religious.

Sure. You can call it a miracle or God's work if you had just enough milk for your cereal or finished both the shampoo and conditioner at the same exact time. God didn't do that either, for all of *your* previous actions did, but whatever. It doesn't really matter because nobody did anything monumental and praise-worthy there.

But to say that God did something amazing like save a child's life, take down a school shooter, apprehend a thief, found a missing person, etc is just wrong. It's simply appalling and unfair, and blatantly discredits the actual people who went through many tiring, challenging, immense processes to give someone something amazing. You're giving the praise to a, quite frankly, fictional being rather than the physical ones that concretely and very obviously sacrificed so much for you. It's just wrong.

**Small edit just to fix a word here and there, as well as clarify**: I recognize that starting this off with ""I have nothing against religion"" may seem counter-intuitive. But I don't have anything against religion as a whole; I have something against those who use religion to discredit others for their benefit, ignore reality, and praise someone who quite plainly didn't do the action that is getting praise. It's a simple matter of a lack of respect. Additionally, I don't mean the common ""thank God!"" phrase - that's perfectly fine. What I mean is the active, continuous thanking of God versus those people involved in something amazing (such as *only* thanking God and not those involved, or simply making God the main focus of the gratitude). Also, I gotta be that person as I don't know how to find who did it and thank them personally: thank you so much for my first ♪siiilver and gooold♪!!",0

Preheating the oven is a scam ran by the government to take your money,39608,1423,2019-01-18 09:17:06,"Every fucking time I buy a frozen pizza, I put that sassy bitch in right when I start the oven. Why? Because I’ve figured it out. That’s right Uncle Sam, I’m onto you. 

The directions for my favorite pizza is to heat the oven to 425F and cook for 15 minutes. My oven takes 14 minutes to preheat. So, this whole cooking process takes about 30 minutes? No way. Not chance in hell, buckaroo. When I shove my pizza in that oven prematurely, I add 3-4 minutes to compensate. This means I wait a total of 18-19 minutes vs 30. And guess what? It tastes fucking delicious. Ask any of my friends. I cook them frozen pizzas all the time, and they can’t get enough, thanks to my unequivocal superior intelligence. The pizza turns out just fine, and it poses no health threat. Source: I’ve been doing this for 12 years.

Maybe it isn’t significant if one person cooks their frozen Italian love pie for 10 extra minutes, but you’re a thinker. You’re looking at the grand  scheme of things.

People who advocate for weed and its medicinal benefits don’t actually care about the medicinal part. The majority just want to get stoned without getting judged for it.,39463,4570,2020-08-15 03:15:05,"“I smoke a bowl each night so I can actually fall asleep”

“My.. leg.. hurts, so I smoke weed for it”

“Have you heard what weed can do for your \[insert health problem here\]? Try smoking indica, it’ll clear that right up”

Let’s not kid ourselves. The grand majority of people who smoke pot do it to get high. Of course there are people who do have legitimate health stuff that they treat with weed, but come on. Most people are just trying to get stoned but don’t feel comfortable enough to admit it, so they blame it on a health reason. You’re most likely not smoking because you get headaches, but rather because you want to binge watch Netflix and eat a pint of Ben & Jerry’s without people giving you shit for it.

EDIT: Not sure where some of you are getting the idea that I don't want weed to be legal from this post. I'm all for legalizing weed. This post has nothing to do with legalization. My whole point was that most people who smoke pot do it to get stoned but use it as a medical excuse so that other people won't judge them. Should people judge them? No, but there is a still a stigma attached to pot.

EDIT: I also clearly stated in this post that I know there are people who *do* smoke it for medical reasons and it helps. Once again, I never said that it didn't. All I am saying is that the grand majority are just trying to get stoned lol.

"""Woke"" people can be some of the most abusive people you'll ever meet",39301,3085,2020-06-15 21:52:25,"At least, this has been my experience.


I think it's great when people take a stand for social issues and I have no issues with being awake. However, this can go too far and it allows for people to become abusive *while thinking they are completely in the right*. That's an incredibly dangerous thing.


My ex was one of these people. She cared deeply about fixing social issues and because of that she felt it was fine to steamroll everyone she knew and cared about because their discomfort was worth the change she was pushing. To an extent, I even agree with that. She was way too hypocritical though. Eventually she became dead to my feelings. If she hurt me, I did something to deserve it, or I was overreacting out of fragility and needed to ""get a grip"". She was never willing to admit wrong, and my views were always tainted because I was a guy.


I spent way too long in that relationship hating myself because I respected her efforts for change. It wasn't until I sought therapy that I realized how hurtful she was being. Eventually I came to the conclusion that believing the same things she did didn't give her a pass to treat people awfully. So yeah, sometimes the most outwardly caring and seemingly empathetic people can be the most abusive ones in your life.


Edit: there's nothing wrong with caring about or trying to fix social issues. I hold values very similar to hers. This isn't targeting beliefs saying they are wrong, it's targeting bad actions done thinking they are justified with good beliefs.",0

It's okay to break up with someone because of their mental health issues.,38220,1697,2020-08-13 14:51:19,"I just want to preface this post and say I have nothing against anyone who is working through mental health issues or am I trying to offend them. You have your own battles to fight and that's okay. 

I've noticed that recently there have been a lot of social media posts about dating people with mental health issues (eg. post like ""dating someone who understands ur mental health is soo important. there's humans who will make u feel terrible for things u can't or don't know how to control yet""). I feel that posts like this don't understand the impact it can have on the other person in the relationship. 

As someone who has been in a two-year relationship where I was the emotional dumpster for my former partner, I felt insanely guilty for even wanting to break up with them because I couldn't continue to support them in their mental health journey. My former partner would often blame for me not being understanding or patient enough. They snapped at me on multiple occasions when I was talking about my day and my work team and how fun my day at work was because it made them feel more depressed that their work team wasn't as close. Later in the relationship, I had learnt to only ask about how their day went but never share my own, in fear of not being supportive of their mental health. 

Now I know that not everyone with mental health issues will be like my former partner, but posts on social media perpetuate the stigma that YOU'RE the unempathetic/uncaring/non-supportive one if you can't understand your partner's mental health. 

It's not true. You're not a bad person for wanting to break up with them. It's okay to break up with your partner if they're being toxic. Being with someone who is going through mental health issues is draining and it's okay to break up with your partner if their mental health is too much for you. It's okay to not be an emotional dumpster for your partner. Please remember that you're a person too. You have your limits and your own mental health to take care of.

It's absurd to suggest that we start altering our history to speak only of the people who were purely good by today's standards. We would literally have zero founding fathers in history books if we were to stop honoring them because of their racist views at the time.

Most people have literally no clue what communism actually is.,37664,7032,2020-05-19 21:01:42,"I will start by saying that I'm not the expert either, proving the point. 

I'm using the United States as the basis for this argument since in my country Portugal, we have a Communist Party but their members and people in general actually understand what they believe in and what they want if they managed to become the governing party - it's basically impossible at this moment and they have 7/8% or less every election. 

But in the US I come to realize that people actually have no idea what communism or communist ideas are. Socialism isn't equal to communism. Also, ""everything I disagree with"" isn't communism. You are just an idiot that chooses to be ignorant or that doesn't want to hear ""no"" more often than none.

I would even argue that most people can't even point if a political idea is mostly left or right-wing.

**EDIT 1:**

 It seems to be important to clarify that my goal was never to promote communism as some great idea that is the best option for your country or something. My only point was: people talk about stuff and equate it to communism when there is actually no evidence of it being the case or it being even remotely close in terms of what both represent.

In my interpretation and simplifying it, Communism is a socio-economical and political ideology based on a self-sustaining human existence that wants to promote an egalitarian society and with no social classes.

Thanks /u/aprx4 for the correction on the definition. Proving my point that even OP doesn't know the exact and correct definition and that's why I'm not throwing the word around like it's nothing.

**EDIT 3:** 

Taking away your rights =/= communism. Inter-racial marriage =/= communism. Yes, socialism is on the same spectrum of communism but there is a big difference between both ideologies but you can argue that socialism is a middle term for socialism but you can have a Socialist Party that doesn't intend on becoming a Communist Party or even implementing a Communist Regime/Society. The same way you wouldn't classify every single right-wing party ""nationalist"".",0
Adults who don't drink water because they don't like the taste of it are infantile and immature. Not everything needs to be exciting in order to be hydrated.,37547,3441,2020-08-15 23:57:25,"I'm personally frustrated with people who cannot drink just a glass of water and need either soda or crystal light or something to make it more exciting. Water is great, you need it!

Edit: I assumed this post would just die honestly because I thought it would be judged to be a popular opinion, and based on the majority of comments it is generally a pretty popular opinion if not too strong of one for personally insulting people by calling them infantile and immature. I stand by this modification: if you have clean water and insist on drinking something else with a bunch of sugar all the time you are behaving immaturely and childishly. If you do not have access to clean or drinkable water this absolutely doesn't apply. I posted on an old throwaway (not made for this post) because it stemmed from a very recent conversation with a few people who know my main account, and this old throwaway was also a water related AITA (I was judged to be TA, which I ended up agreeing and seeing the other side) so I thought that was a decent use of that old account. Please consider drinking more water and taking some of the suggestions within the comments for how to make it tastier without adding unnecessary sugars to it.",0

Gaming is a healthier medium for young adults than Social Media and YouTube in terms of mental health,37436,1264,2020-08-22 06:36:43,"Gaming has a bad reputation for being addictive and frowned upon by parents since their kids seem to always be gaming and not doing anything productive. Although gaming can be addictive and a time sink, I argue that it's still much better to have a society interested in gaming, especially young adults, than all obsessed with social media and YouTube instead. Of course gamers also use social media and YouTube, but I'm talking about the hardcore users of these other mediums where they don't game and use that time to consume these other mediums more instead.

Social Media: Young adults using social media is terrible for their mental health. Apps like Instagram makes them feel like they need to show off fake affluence, stuff, or go on unnecessary trips to keep up with the Joneses. They need to document their life just because everyone else is and if they don't document it in a way that looks appealing to others , they're afraid of being judged. This is bullshit. On the other hand, if these people didn't put so much emphasis on social media and just games instead, there is no stupid competition between friends since the gamer doesn't value dumb stuff like that as much. They're too involved with the games to be interested in petty and vapid competition between peers.

YouTube: Yes, everyone watches YouTube. But non-gamers who put more time into YouTube I argue can be bad depending on the content they consume. YouTube has all sorts of content, but a lot of the content is paid propaganda to influence people to believe their political agenda. A lot of channels try to get kids to fall down an alt-right rabbit hole without them even realizing that it's happening, they're just browsing videos on YouTube to kill time then all of a sudden they have these right-wing beliefs that they probably wouldn't have if they didn't fall down a rabbit hole. 

Huge channels are funded by organizations to spread influence about their political beliefs, it's not a fair balance. Google doesn't care as long as they're getting paid. If these impressionable young adults were just playing video games, they'd stay away from the politics for the most part and disinformation out there. They wouldn't be as vested into these channels and spend their focus on improving on games.",0

Reddit has become the place where the childhood bullied become the bullies,37038,4342,2019-10-23 15:29:32,"Let me explain. The Reddit community is the most condescending trash I have ever seen. They constantly put others down to bolster their own insecurities, subs like r/trashy serve this exact purpose of 'we're better than them.'

Now for my title, in highschools of old (maybe 5-10 years ago) nerds, geeks, and just non popular people would be bullied, most of these people now make their way onto Reddit.

The majority of people here are extremely critical of intelligence to the point where it could be considered bullying. You get one thing wrong they will pounce onto you and just shut everything you have to say with 'you're not smart, remember when you said this.' one of the biggest targets is the general populace, who are heavily subject to the 'superior' redditors. This is just used to treat their insecurities in saying 'we're special and different right? We're smart' no you're not, you're literally a clone of every neckbeard redditor on the site so stfu",0

Plastic bottled water in first world countries should be banned,36948,5226,2019-06-13 19:42:36,"Someone made me realise today that in the west we legitimately flush our toilets with water cleaner than 90% of the world and yet we totally avoid drinking our tap water.

"Working 40 hours a week to afford a quality of life you're satisfied with is a blessing, not a curse.",36882,3108,2020-08-21 06:55:20,"I often hear redditors, and sometimes real actual people, talk about how 40 hour work weeks are oppressive. I'm not trying to challenge that, but the reality is that you are lucky and blessed if you can afford to work only 40 hours a week. \[I am speaking from the perspective of an American, but I wouldn't be surprised if this applied to other countries as well.\]

The vast majority of well paying careers expect you to work far more than 40 hours a week. Think of the traditionally aspirational white-collar positions, doctor, lawyer, various finance jobs, engineer, etc... All these jobs are notorious for working 50-60 hours a week and even more. Those ""sexy"" careers, like game dev, designer, sports/entertainment agent? More than 40 hours. Want to be your own boss and become a successful entrepreneur/content creator? Great, now you have no boundaries between work and your personal life, and again, you'll probably be working more than 40 hours. Want to do the right thing and work for a non-profit? You'll make far less than your peers and work more than 40 hours.

Most often, full-time positions that only require 40 hours of work are ones with an hourly wage and management that does not want to pay overtime. Often this is a red flag, as it can lead to the expectation of accomplishing 10 hours of work in an 8 hour day.

In most industries, the prestigious and high paying positions are associated with larger workloads, not less. This includes those big Silicon Valley companies renown for their workplace benefits, such as Google.

I'm not trying to say that it's wrong or entitled to want to work 40 hours or less, but unrealistic goals aren't healthy. A 40 hour work week that pays well is an aspirational goal that will require sacrifice to attain, and is not something easily accomplished. From the outset, you'll have to be smart about you career decisions and end up working a lot. Once you're in the position to take a job that provides better work-life balance while still paying the bills, you'll have to make a difficult choice between free time and income/career advancement.

EDIT: I wanted to further emphasize that I'm not intending to cast judgement on anyone who doesn't wish to work 40 hours a week or more. If it were up to me, I'd hardly work at all. I'm simply pointing to the fact that it's rare and difficult to work 40 hours  a week or less and be able to afford the quality of life you want, and that it's not realistic to expect to work 40 hours a week or less when starting your career. It's not a choice for most people. To have the choice, is a privilege.

EDIT2: Holy shit this blew up. Thanks I guess? However, I feel like there is a misunderstanding I want to clear up. It's possible to acknowledge all these things simultaneously: 1) that it's difficult to be able to work 40 hours a week or less and afford the quality of life one desires; 2) that by it being hard to achieve for most people, it's a position of privilege and a good deal of luck (""a blessing""); and 3) this shouldn't be the case and establishes that there are many flaws that need to be addressed in our government, economy, and culture. The basis of this ""unpopular opinion"" was the premise that a 40 hour workweek is terrible and avoidable, while I argue that it's a privileged position in our current economic reality, for better or worse. Not sure if that makes this better or worse, as this is [r/unpopularopinion](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/) after all. ",0

"Male friendships are very misunderstood by society, and they’re much more valuable and healthy than they’re portrayed as.",36414,1394,2020-08-09 23:07:56,"As a dude, I’ve seen a lot of people, talk about male friendships as being “bullying competitions”, “emotionally stunted”, “toxic”, etc.

When I ask for their reasoning, I get told that men trash talk each other so their friendships are based on insecurity, that dudes don’t open up for their friends or support each other, or that it’s just a giant dick swinging contest.

I find this portrayal to be very unfortunate, and a deep misunderstanding.

I can’t speak for all men, so please don’t tell me that I am, I can only offer my perspective, and what I’ve seen in other men.

Our trash talking isn’t meant to hurt. We shit talk our boys because we know they’ve got our back and vice versa, it’s done in the intent of poking fun, of getting a good laugh, and it shows the strength of our bond.

In every single male friend group I’ve had, there were boundaries that weren’t crossed. If you trash talk your bro, and he tells you seriously that he doesn’t appreciate it, you stop. And those who continue are usually told to quit it.

Are there guys who take it too far? Absolutely.
Are there guys who simply cannot enjoy it? Yup.

The guys who can’t trash talk without being toxic should not represent all guys, they’re obnoxious and not the majority.


As for the “emotionally stunted” part, again, that’s a hilariously bad way of seeing it.

And again, not speaking for all men, but a significant number of guys just don’t WANT to sit down and talk about how they feel all the time.

If I have a serious issue or feeling and want to bring it up to my friend, I will, and he’ll listen 100%.

We don’t open up all the time, but that makes the times we do very significant and serious, and we give full attention.

Saying that guys don’t open up because of society isn’t the full picture. We open up, but selectively. 

To our closest friend, our dad, our brother, our uncle or father figure, etc. 

My friends don’t need to be aware of my emotional state at all times. I love them to death, and if they want to talk to me they can. But we hang out to do activities with each other, talk shit and forget about our problems.

Male and female friendships have different dynamics, and that’s okay, we should learn to accept these differences, recognize the flaws inherent to each dynamic, and make them better.

But we shouldn’t label one dynamic as being inherently flawed just because it’s different than the other. 

I would never trade the awesome bonds I’ve made for anything, and I do not believe they’d be better without the trash talk, or with more opening up. 

Ultimately you see things the way you want to, but saying this is the same as saying that female friendships are just gossip and drama.

It’s at best, an exaggeration, and at worst, a hollow echo of the truth.

EDIT: I’m very happy this opinion is popular, far too many guys are shamed into thinking their way of things isn’t the right one, I needed to see this positivity.

"If your child asks for birth control, for the love of god please give it to them.",36339,3154,2019-12-18 20:39:42,"A pretty obvious opinion, but rather unpopular where I’m from in the Midwest. I’m thankful that my mother told me that if I ever needed birth control, she would get it to me. That was 7 years ago when I was 13. Now I’m 20, in a long term relationship, and have been on birth control since 17. Might not like some of the side effects I’ve seen (acne, bloating, slight weight gain etc.) But at least I don’t have a child.   

Both of my two girl friends from high school were not allowed to be on any form of birth control. One had to get it through college, one didn’t have an option till post graduation. 

My point is, you are not going to prevent your kid from having sex by keeping birth control from them. If you as a parent truly think that, you are delusional. Teenagers/young adults will always find a way to do what they want, and their parents telling them ‘no’ is just going to make them want to do it more. 

And this doesn’t just go for girls, I’m only writing it this way because I am a girl, and I know firsthand. Give your son condoms if he needs them, and educate both your sons and daughters about being safe. 

EDIT: Took a nap and came back to all of this. Just wanted to point out a few things as I’ve been scrolling through the comments. 

1. Yes, I am well aware the female birth control does have long term side effects. I’m also aware that it’s trial and error. I’m on my 3rd type of birth control and I’ve never been happier. It’s hard to discover what really works for you and that’s why it’s so important to see a doctor and not order pills online like they have available now. 

2. I’m well aware that female birth control doesn’t protect against STIs. But here’s the thing, condoms don’t protect against babies either. Doubling up on both female birth control AND condoms is a great way to prevent both a baby and STIs. 

3. Some are talking about fertility and birth control. It is known that the birth control shot CAN increase your risk of infertility a bit more than most birth control. But let’s think of other things that can affect fertility. Smoking, extreme weight loss, other types of hormones such as things we put in food, endometriosis. I could go on.

4. Rape happens. If you’re on birth control, chances are you’re not going to get pregnant.

5. Women can do whatever they want with their bodies. 

6. 20 y/o female living in Ohio, grew up catholic. For all you saying religion is the answer.

7. This is definitely leaning more towards girls on the pill, instead of boys with condoms. If you are calling your FEMALE child a whore, slut or anything of the sort, there is something wrong with you. Women can have sex. WOMEN CAN HAVE SEX.

8. How could I forget something so important? BIRTH CONTROL IS USED FOR SO MANY OTHER THINGS.

"We spend TOO much time discussing homosexuality when only ~4% of the population is gay, but meanwhile 80% of the population of the planet lives in poverty.",36202,2591,2019-02-01 18:15:22,"I get human rights, ending discrimination, etc and I am 100% on board; but the amount of time spent talking about something that affects so few people and the amount of posturing by the affected parties is insane.  I agree it's important, but it's nothing you need a parade for.  There are waaaay bigger issues that get very little traction, such as the number of people living in poverty, even in the most developed nations.  Why is that?  Is it that the issues that affect huge percentages are too difficult to address?  Is it that no one in Hollywood is poor, but a disproportionate number are gay, so there is no platform for poverty?  Is the feeling that poverty is a choice?  Why don't we have parades for teachers or people who are working to better the world for much larger percentages of the population?

Disclaimer - I know it's been a long, hard fight for basic human dignity for homosexual people.

"Telling people who have severe facial deformities that they're beautiful is disingenuous, patronizing, dishonest, and self-congratulatory.",36122,2525,2019-04-26 16:50:25,"There's a youtuber named Nikki Lilly who does music and makeup videos on youtube. She looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/HqmUQng.jpg).

If you go to the comments section of any of her videos, you see hundreds or thousands of comments that are telling her how beautiful she is. There are rarely any other kind of comments as far as I can tell.

Now, this kind of strikes me as similar to telling an overweight woman that she is skinny. By no societal standards in the world that I can imagine would this girl be considered physically beautiful. She has a condition that causes her to have a severe and grotesque deformity on half of her face. She doesn't deserve to be bullied for this, of course. But I think the millions of fans she has and these thousands of comments are no coincidence. I think her appearance is the reason for her popularity, and so people view her as a freakshow, just of a different kind. People flock to her to her channel since they see her as a freakshow, but they just leave patronizing comments telling her how beautiful she is so they and everyone who upvotes them can feel good about themselves.

I see this as extremely strange behavior. It's almost as if Nikki is some sort of ""moral well"" from which people can draw in order to feel good about themselves and others, to have an unspoken, massive communal back-patting party in the comments about how good they all are as people. Her videos have thousands or tens of thousands of comments. People know the creator of the video will probably not see the comments, however they *do* know that other people will. That's why they leave these comments.

This is a bizarre new kind of phenomenon, and while I'm always happy for a fellow youtuber getting attention on their channel, I don't think this is a good kind of attention. I think it's actually a very disingenuous and off-putting kind of trend. It leaves me feeling very dirty and confused about the nature of social media.

It wouldn't be so bad if the comments were just normal, mildly supportive or even constructive comments, but these comments are really exaggerated. All caps, dozens of heart emojis, lots of exclamation points. It's almost as if they're trying to one-up each other for who can be the most overwhelmingly supportive and saccharine with their comments. It's actually kind of disgusting. I don't even know if we have words for this kind of behavior, since this is kind of a new phenomenon.

Really, I just feel sorry for this girl. I wonder if she understands what's going on.

EDIT: There are a lot of people talking about the subjective quality of beauty. In case it's unclear, I'm talking about the physical attractiveness of someone's face, which has a [basis in science](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/social-instincts/201507/what-facial-features-do-men-really-find-attractive?collection=1077685). I understand that beauty as a poetic concept does indeed have a high degree of subjectivity, but that's not what I'm talking about. Remember that Nikki is primarily a makeup/beauty vlogger, so comments about her being beautiful are likely referring to her appearance.

EDIT 2: This post is really blowing up, so I wanted to share [this video]( https://youtu.be/8K9Gg164Bsw) posted by /u/thefarrquad which I think applies to this situation.",0
Taking a bite out of a KitKat Bar is better than 'breaking off a piece'.,36099,5817,2019-09-24 18:43:53,"That's right. Taking a bite out of a freshly opened KitKat Bar is more satisfying than splitting up the little sticks. If you open up a wrapper and start breaking these wafers apart, you're not only making more work for yourself, you're ruining a perfectly good candy bar. Biting down into these connected pieces of chocolate gives you the added texture bonus of biting through the crevice between the connected mounds and then being able to snap them apart in your mouth with your tongue. I will not hide this anymore, I don't care how much my fiance threatens to leave me and I don't care if my children call another man their father.

Women can be bad in bed too - and most don’t even know it / Society gives them a pass,35679,3283,2020-01-06 08:51:34,"You hear a lot about guys that are bad in bed: the orgasm gap, one minute men, guys that refuse to go down on girls at all, small penises etc.  It’s politically correct to criticize men and women are always willing to complain.

But in my personal experience and talk with my successful with women male friends women are quite likely to be bad and selfish in bed.  I don’t sleep with men so I don’t have a clue about men but a sizeable minority of women exhibit almost all of these traits:

- doesn’t move and is only a passive recipient of pleasure 
- foreplay is only for her never for you 
- frozen hands never move or stimulate partner 
- unnatural revulsion at seminal fluid 
-  always wants to be on bottom
- rarely initiate
- lack enthusiasm 
-  thinks penetrative sex must be so good for men that it’s all they need to offer in bed to be great
- unwilling to discuss it and/or super defensive and projecting if their partner brings it up 

Maybe it’s the constant cheerleading or the constant male libido but don’t be fooled ladies, some of y’all are garbage in the ole sack!  Personally I think some men are so thirsty these girls never know they are a potato in the sheets.

"As someone new to Reddit, I find this site a kind of disturbing, Highly Politicized, Karma-addicted, self-defeating hivemind.",35433,3351,2020-03-25 11:29:14,"Firstly, I think this could be changed quite easily by simply doing away with up/downvotes. As someone new to this site, it seems to me that these do nothing to encourage the free exchange of ideas, and basically just exist to reinforce some kind of unwritten, yet universally understood consensus criteria which is executed unconsciously by members and by which everything is Judged.

People seem to have a vague, instinctual sense of what the Hivemind wants, and play up to it for purposes of generating the social currency of Reddit which is Karma. Sometimes they get it wrong, or just resist it, and in such cases, they are instantly and viciously torn to shreds like an ant entering a stream of ants from a different colony  by other posters who apparently relish such opportunities to pay totem to the reddit Hivemind God, which validates this behavior and rewards their faith once again through the miracle of upvotes.

The net result is a kind of vapid, recycled echo chamber. The froth and dregs, but no middle. The same ideas offered up like prayers, in all manner of instances which may in some cases even be unique in their particularities, but usually aren't, and never vary in theme-- -Forever.

It's a collective beast of emotion operating on some algorithm of demented, utterly artificial and totally insincere pseudo-morality which is either the petard upon which it has hoisted itself or otherwise serves as an excuse to spruik inconsequential, meaningless drivel to the end of feeding its insane and profound addiction to a meaningless Fiat: Karma.

Especially at university campuses and colleges where it is very common to separate the boys and the girls at the start of the year for workshops against sexual assault, imagine if they separated the whites and the blacks and taught the whites how to avoid being robbed and taught the blacks the definition of theft. Or if they gave all the non muslims a ‘bomb whistle’ to blow when they think they are about to be bombed.

"Offending someone and then calling them fragile, sensitive or triggered to shut them down etc is cheap, manipulative and counterproductive.",35274,2059,2020-07-08 22:21:17,"It goes like this: 

Person 1 makes an inflammatory statement that strongly challenges another's views. Person 2 (the target of the statement) will take the bait and respond, often in a defensive manner as they feel attacked (they were, that was the point of the initial statement). Person 1, elated with themselves, smugly ridicules person 2 and calls them fragile to shut them down. Person 2 wants to respond, but if they defend themselves, person 1 will claim this is proof of their fragility. If they don't reply, person 1 will claim they've won the argument.

This is such a cheap way of scoring meaningless points. Nothing is gained here. No meaningful discussion is had, no views are changed. If anything, all that happens is person 2 ends up with a stronger negative attitude towards people who align themselves with person 1's views, increasing polarisation. 

The goal should be to win over people that hold opposing views with rational argument, patience and understanding. Ridiculing doesn't work, especially not online. I personally feel like a large percentage of social media users needs to take a few deep breaths, stop focusing on 1upping each other with meaningless, toxic argument and focus on commonalities that bring us together rather than militantly pointing out differences that cause frustration and division. Wishful thinking lol.

"Society IS hypersexualised, and I feel scared for the kids growing up with it.",35242,3845,2020-05-22 02:39:26,"Let me start by saying that I'm 17. This is coming from a place of serious concern. I'm not some boomer trying to rag on the new generation because I have nothing better to do.

Everything is so unnecessarily sexualised these days. Adverts for the most banal products, music, random sex scenes in movies that could have been marketed to younger audiences without them, you name it: there's a naked girl or a weird moaning noise or an obvious innuendo. It's kind of sickening.

A lot of people argue that ""it's not over-sexualisation, it's sexual liberation!"" That this phenomenon is taking motion because people (mostly women, whose ability to do it has been hampered for centuries) are feeling more comfortable in their bodies and with expressing their sexuality. And that's great! 

But we don't need it everywhere. Every second tweet coming across my timeline is someone oversharing on their sexual experiences for clout and every song and music video is geared towards some sort of sexual stimulation/release. Everything is just constantly screaming sex, sex, sex.

Now, here's where my concern comes in: if the Internet was made up solely of people who had a sharp grasp on reality and on themselves, this onslaught of sexual content wouldn't be nearly as worrying as it is. But that's not the case. Younger, much more impressionable kids are using the Internet nowadays, and it's bleeding into the content I see from them.

Take the biggest culprit as example: TikTok. What may seem to many of us as completely harmless because the constant wave of hypersexualised content has practically immunised us to its effects would terrify any mother, and I couldn't say I would blame it. Kids doing sexual POVs, inappropriate dances, and dressing the way that they do is all a cause of the fact that they see older people doing it, normalising it, and running with it. There have been countless times that I have seen videos of boys standing shirtless in their rooms lipsynching to sexual lyrics and girls dancing incredibly explicitly and then I click on their page and see that they're 13, 14, 15, or 16.

That is horrifying to me. It's basically a new wave of paedophile fodder, and it's the fault of society's hypersexualisation.

I'm not here to pearl clutch and say that sexual expression should not be allowed or something. Of course not; everybody should be able to do exactly what they want to do. But we have to be extremely conscious of the people that are seeing our content, however fleetingly, and censor ourselves for their safety. I'm also not here to say that wearing certain clothes somehow constitutes immediate sexual intentions from other people: but you have to admit that nonces are more likely to go for children they see as ""easy"" and therefore vulnerable. That's why I'm so fucking scared for them.

Anyway, this is just an opinion. Looking forward to the ""society has always been sexual"" comments.",0

A bad teacher has more negative influence upon society than a drug dealer,35017,1145,2020-09-19 09:35:39,"Some people would say teachers are like your second parents. Children spend many, many hours of the most important stages of their lives with teachers, so without a doubt they have a huge impact on their growth.

Sure, if we're comparing them individually, one bad drug dealer can definitely hurt a single person much more than one bad teacher. Drug addiction is a pretty serious thing after all. But take into consideration that drug dealers sell to a very small percentage of the population, whereas teachers are going to impact much more people, teaching hundreds if not thousands of students throughout their entire careers. They can be the reason children end up resenting a certain subject they could have had a lot of potential in, or worse, resenting school entirely and maybe even dropping out and becoming a drug dealer.

Heck, bad teachers are a gateway drug themselves in some cases.",0
Forcing children to change in front of each other for gym is sexually abusive and this is a hill I will die on.,35001,3813,2020-09-22 00:53:56,"When I was in middle and high school, one of the greatest sources of trauma I have ever endured was being forced to change in front of the other girls in locker rooms. They would make fun of my body relentlessly throughout that entire time. Not only was I the nerdy kid, but I basically had the body of a 11 year old until I was 16 and went through a major growth spurt where I went from completely flat chested to 32DD in the span of a single summer. So, my gym experience went from being made fun of for having a child's body to being accused of ""getting implants"" and further ridiculed the rest of my school life. Because it was solely my word against that of 8 other girls, the administration did nothing to stop it, even though the rumors spread like wildfire throughout the entire school. It's worth mentioning that i was extremely embarrassed by how fast my breasts grew, so I wore extreme baggy shirts to try to hide them. However, those attempts to hide them were moot thanks to the locker room before gym.

The worst incident crossed the line into full blown sexual assault. Four of the more popular girls circled around me and violently poked and squeezed my breasts, to the point where it was incredibly painful and they hurt for several days. It was some weird test to see if they were real or implants.

I was molested by a male adult as a 7 year old child and, to be completely honest, the abuse I suffered from my peers that i just described was every bit as traumatizing as that. In a way, it was even worse because there was no escaping it. At least when I told my parents about the abuse from the adult, it was dealt with and I never had to see him again. With the abuse from my peers, I had to suffer for years. 

Some of you might argue ""that was an especially shitty crop of girls, not every locker room experience is like that"". Yeah, but a) the administration didn't believe me because it was my word against everyone else's so I had to go through this shit for SIX FUCKING YEARS despite making literally 8 different complaints. b) quite frankly, it shouldn't take a seriously traumatic scenario to justify the idea that CHILDREN SHOULDN'T HAVE TO STRIP IN FRONT OF PEOPLE UNNECESARRILY WHEN THEY'RE NOT COMFORTABLE. c) if you think locker rooms abuse is rare, you are living under a rock.

Honestly, I gotta say- I genuinely don't see how anyone, besides pedophiles getting off on it, could stand by the idea that we should continue to systemically force children to strip in front of each other.

"Taylor Swift has a victim mentality.

The article also quotes a label exec saying: 

> Taylor can 100 percent perform all of her catalog, past and present, at the AMAs. Big Machine has no issue with her performance going out on live broadcast because it recognizes it doesn’t have the right to block her. Labels can’t block any artists from performing any songs live.

So take it however you will. Lots of cool and differing opinions in here and I’ve enjoyed reading them. Thanks for participating you guys 💕

(**Original post below here**)

have a feeling this is going to be an unpopular post, because regarding the [recent news](https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1195123215657508867) about Taylor's record label dispute, reddit has been overwhelmingly in support of her.

Taylor Swift is always playing the victim. Almost all of her songs are about how some boy came along and broke her heart, and how tragic that is because she was a perfect angel girlfriend and he was the absolute devil.

Example. She put [Joe Jonas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amh859mNeKI) on blast over their breakup. Told everyone on Ellen that he broke up with her in a 20 second phone call. But Joe Jonas came out and said that the only reason the phone call was so short was because *she* hung up on him.

Ok, but she was only 19 with this happened. Surely she's grown and changed as a person since then?

Nope. I'm not gonna link sources because you can find them easily on google, but she continues to have relationships like this. They end bitterly and she writes a song or makes a snarky public comment about how awful her ex is. Examples:  John Mayer, Calvin Harris, Harry Styles, Jake Gyllenhaal.

Look at her feuds with other celebrities. Kanye and Katy Perry are kind of insane, but she's fought with many others: Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, the list goes on.

Look at how she defends herself in all of these situations. She has literally told lies (ex: the kanye west debate and the joe jonas thing) to paint a better portrait of her as the victim.

And didn't she lie about her masters situation when the news first broke, too? Didn't it come out that Taylor did know about the deal and did have the opportunity to buy her masters, but she passed it up?? It seems she had the power to stop this from ever happening in the first place.

Now she's posting some pretty big accusations of him publicly, but she has nothing to back up her claims. She is literally asking her fans to brigade someone and have blind faith that what she's saying about him is completely true.

It definitely could be true. And I do feel bad for her if that's the case.

But she's a 30 year old grown ass woman. Worth half a billion dollars. She could afford the best attorneys in the world to take this guy down. But she decides to vent on twitter and ask her teenage fans to attack someone based on her word alone (which has historically been unreliable). I get that people think this is an important message to spread. But the way she worded it sure seemed like it wasn't about spreading awareness so much as it was about getting revenge.

Taylor Swift reminds me of a high schooler. Her ""squad"" is a clique and she is their Regina George. She has a pattern of unstable relationships and an inability to see her own flaws in them.

Taylor seems to think everyone else is the problem. Nah Taylor, you're the problem. The common factor in all these situations is you.

Another point I’d like to make is if you agree that people shouldn’t be ashamed of what their ancestors did then by symmetry they shouldn’t be proud either. Current Mongols don’t need to feel ashamed of Ghengis Khan. I don’t think modern Germans should be held responsible for Hitler. That also means they shouldn’t get credit for the great things their ancestors have done either.

I like when people blast their music from their cars with the windows down,34201,1425,2020-08-08 08:53:40,"It gives me a brief look into someone’s day and I just think it’s cool to hear what different people like to listen to. I was on a drive with the windows down today and heard so many songs playing at once, it gave me intense La La Land intro vibes and I just really loved it. 

I especially love matches you wouldn’t expect, like an older woman listening to rap or a cool looking youngin playing some classical or instrumental music.

If your boyfriend/husband is uncomfortable with a certain guy friend because he “knows their intentions” 90% of the chance he’s right.,34167,2916,2020-03-27 06:52:42,"Now this isn’t saying that every time your boyfriend see’s another guy talking to you he has the right to be upset, this isn’t condoning abusive and controlling relationships by a long mark. There are certain situations where the other guy could be a longtime friend, or be with another person, or just have no interest in that sense, and it doesn’t mean that being overly jealous is a healthy behavior. What it is about is if a guy suddenly comes into the girls life and is very flirty, always demeans the boyfriend on the littlest things in hopes to cause a fight, and is overly nice and affectionate to the point it’s weird and if it’s at that point that “friend” is not trying to just be friends. There’s a difference between “Hey I hope you’re having a good day” and “Hey cutie how’s it going you wanna hangout at my place?” Most guys think alike and we can see when a guy is obviously trying to shoot his shot. If you’re letting someone talk to you like that and just let them proceed while your significant other has stated they don’t feel comfortable with they talk to you, you’re the one causing the problem and being toxic. Just respect your significant others feelings and emotions by understanding their point of view and tell that person they can’t flirt with you like that. My ex always had guy friends acting like this and she always insisted they didn’t like her that way, and unsurprisingly the week we broke up they all confessed their feelings for her and that they’ve liked her all along. As much as it sucks to say many guys are vultures at the chance of getting laid when the opportunity arises.",0
To girls who friendzone guys: they're not obligated to keep being your friend,34151,3917,2019-10-19 20:58:41,"I say this as a gay man who sees this with many of my female friends. 

If you have a guy friend who makes a move and you put him in the friend zone, he has every right to not stay in your life. Some guys want to date you plain and simple. These guys probably had a crush on you from the start and pursued you in the hopes of a romantic relationship. These guys listened to your problems, took interest in your day, and cared about your needs to show you they can be a good partner. But it's not the same as a platonic friendship. If you friendzone a guy like this, he will do one of two things: 

1) Stick around with either the hopes you'll change your mind (super common) or because he feels he can quickly move on and be genuine friends (rare)

2) Not talk to you again because he doesn't want to hear about you seeing other guys or hear about your boy problems. 

He's under no obligation to be your friend just like you're under no obligation to date him. This also applies to men who friendzone their female friends.",0
"For fire, police and military, women should have to pass *identical* physical standards as men. Women should not be given a lower standard.",34030,2004,2020-06-27 01:48:43,"First off, I have zero issue with women working in any of these fields. If this is what you want to do, fucking get after it - who am I to judge what you want to do with your life.

My issue is with the physical standards for men and women. Where I live in Canada, for the physical tests required to become a firefighter or officer (and maybe soldier?), women have lower requirements than their male counterparts. Women are not required to have the same strength and speed as men.

A fire does not provide smaller victims, because a petite female is responding. Criminals don't take it easier on smaller women. Terrorists will engage in combat with any gender. And so on.

If my 200lb ass is unconscious in a building fire, I want someone that's 6'5"" and 260lbs to toss me over their shoulder and carry me out, not some 115lb person (male or female) that can barely drag me on the ground. (*In-line edit: The 6'5""/260lbs firefighter is hyperbole, to drive a point home. I've had multiple people comment on how unrealistic it is, but obviously there are smaller people who could to a fine job.*)

*But women aren't as strong as men*... Yup, that's generally true. Of course there are exceptions; I know plenty of women that are bigger and stronger than most men. I also know men that are smaller and weaker than your average woman. But your average woman is not physically cut-out for firefighting or policing. And to be fair, your average man isn't either.

When the physical job expectations are identical for both genders, it makes zero sense to lower the bar for one of them. There are smaller men that fail the physical standard for men, but would pass for women. But they aren't female, and so they get the boot.

**Edit**: One good point that multiple people have pointed out is that not all jobs require the same level of fitness. A person running into a burning building requires arguably more fitness/strength/endurance than somebody operating a pump truck. Others have mentioned that the military has non-gendered physical requirements, that instead are based on the job that you will have. So, perhaps this would be an alternative to what currently is in place for police/fire. There would still only be one standard for each role, but there would be multiple roles that require varying levels of fitness.

***Also***... to anyone saying shit like ""women should be at home having babies,"" you can go ahead and sit on your fist. This post isn't meant to perpetuate sexism and archaic thinking, but rather to express my concern with the safety and efficacy of current gendered physical requirements.

**Edit Edit**: The second part of my title should really say ""NOBODY should be given a lower standard."" I know I singled women out in this, but petite men are equally under-qualified for much of this work. I am just as satisfied with a man passing or failing a test as a woman, so long as the test itself adequately reflects the tasks that will be carried out while on the job.

**Edit Edit Edit**: Good lord. RIP, inbox. Trying to keep up with the comments, but it's getting a little overwhelming.

One last thing I'll address, since people keep bringing it up, is that the physical standards are not meant to measure *absolute* strength/fitness. I am not saying that women need to be *as strong* as their male counterparts. There should be a minimum requirement that is the same for all genders, to show that you are capable of performing the job. If you are above that level, good! If you are below, try again or consider a different field.",0

I wish there were more movies where the protagonists lost.,33975,3026,2020-09-07 01:29:16,"I love watching movies, especially with friends. We go out and enjoy new movies and talk about stuff and just overall have a great time, but over the last few years I have been thinking about what movies were the most memorable to me. 

(Potential Spoilers Ahead) Some of the movies I found most memorable are movies like No Country For Old Men, Avengers Infinity War, Se7en, Fight Club, Hannibal etc etc. These movies are all super memorable to me not only because they're good movies but because they break free from the trend of invincible protags that you know are going to win in the end. Now movies where the hero wins are not inherently bad or anything, I just feel like a lot of them lose at least a small bit of their tension because of it. When I watch an action thriller I want to really worry for the heroes, I want to be attached to them and sit at the edge of my seat because I'm not really sure if they will actually make it out alive.

 I find myself getting invested much much more often when uncertainty is part of the movie. I want to worry. I want my heart to race. I want to cry. I want to get mad. I believe that if a movie is capable of making you feel true emotion, it succeeded in what it set out to do. If you cry at the end of a movie you were most certainly invested in the story, and right now I feel like many studios are just too afraid to break the mold in that way. I can understand, I mean money is on the line and lots of it at that. It is definitely a gamble to try to ignore the standard movie structure because many people are so used to it that if a movie doesn't follow that structure, it can feel off or confusing to the viewers, but those movies that do successfully break free of it are often very very memorable because of it.

TLDR: Movies that break the mold and try something unique adds uncertainty to the movie. That uncertainty causes the viewer to become invested in the movie as they never truly know what could happen in the end. If you think the protagonist truly could die or lose, you feel the same emotions they do, and if a movie is able to get you to feel emotion it definitely succeeded in my opinion.",0
Pugs are fucking ugly.,33854,1407,2020-08-18 21:02:04,"These motherfuckers have been bred specifically to look like their face has been assaulted by a fucking book (Like seriously, it's as if God had wanted a new idea for an animal and threw his fucking microwave on a random dog's face and called it a pug). On top of that, their face wrinkles don't help at all, and they have a body shape comparable to that of a Vienna sausage.

Those features don't just LOOK bad, but they have been known to cause significant health problems for them. Because their skull is the shape of a fucking tuna can, they have breathing problems. The skin under their face wrinkles can get infected, and the short body size often causes high blood pressure.

The Pug is the prime example of what happens when humans don't need to interfere with nature.

Some clarification about my opinion. No I am not saying 'the first world countries should adopt kids from third world countries'

Geez stop assuming that your country have figured out all the shit already. And now you have no problems and are left with helping the third world countries. So stop saying, hey I'm from Norway and I don't want to adopt an African child. Your country have zero orphanage?
It's funny how most of you guys assumed that you have to adopt a kid from African countries.

No I'm not pro 'let's adopt and help the third world'
I'm pro ""can't feed em, don't breed em""! 
But if you have money to raise a child, try adopting one, it'll make you happy and you'll be giving a child probably a new beautiful life.

And someone said the adoption cost is ~30,000$ like wtf!
Your country needs to figure out some shit for that man. This cost is an average cost to raise a child for 10 years fulfilling his basic needs and school fees in my country man!

Traveling only appeals to boring people or people who haven’t traveled,33778,4977,2019-04-10 19:17:46,"I’ve traveled everywhere. The UK, Germany, France, India, Bangladesh, about half of the US (including California, Las Vegas, New York, Minneapolis, Tennessee, Hawaii, you get the idea) 

Not once have I ever felt “yeah, I’m experiencing something I couldn’t back at home”

When you travel you have to leave most of your belongings behind, so if you have a hobby that requires any sort of specialized equipment too bad. 

I’ve hiked on mountains, I’ve swam in oceans, Ive been on the London eye, I’ve run through every single tourist attraction there is and not once have I felt “yeah that was worth giving 1 week of my life away”

And I’m not some anti social weirdo, I go out of my way to interact with other people. Nobody is different, at the core of it people still act like people nothing more and nothing less. Yeah sure there are differences, but they aren’t interesting. A quick google search or a reddit post will tell you the major “””””””””culture shocks””””””””””” anyway. 

You wanna know my favorite part of traveling? The fucking trip. The plane ride, the train to the hotel, the taxi caught in traffic for 4 hours. Unironically this is my favorite part because I get to fucking sleep

"Climate Change needs to stop being a political thing. It’s a scientific reality that needs to be taken seriously, and politics just get in the way of us fixing it.",33485,4689,2020-01-05 16:08:54,"Can we all just accept the fact that climate change is real?

"Society should run in shifts so that people who are naturally night owls can go about their lives comfortably, not just the morning people. This would actually benefit the world in several ways.",33446,1062,2020-06-13 11:48:53,"I’ve read that in early hunter-gatherer civilizations, people would work & sleep in shifts. Some were awake during the day, some at night, and some in between. This was to ensure the safety of the group, and likely to maximize productivity as well. This seems to be why humans have evolved to be either “morning larks” or “night owls”. 

Since these traits still exist in humans, our societies should reflect this. Many people I know are total night owls, and find it very difficult to get out of bed & function at the hours that society demands. Yet they are full of creativity, energy & drive at night, firing on all cylinders & getting some fantastic work done. I believe that if society were to operate in shifts, many of these types of people would choose to work at night & sleep in during the day. There are some jobs that offer night shifts but there are not many, and there are basically no options for dining/shopping/activities/etc late at night. 

If this system was put into place, of course it wouldn’t be binding. You would be allowed to switch between working during the day or during the night, or somewhere in between, you’d just have to work it out with your employer. I believe this would also lower the crime rate, as those who choose to commit crimes in the nearly empty & quiet streets of nighttime would find it a lot harder to go unnoticed. 

I’ve considered the potential costs of businesses staying open 24/7, and while I haven’t really calculated the specifics on this one yet (someone smarter than me can chime in on this in the comments) I think it could work. Not every business would be obligated to stay open 24/7, but I believe that employers will be able to find many night-inclined people who would choose to work odd hours if given the option over waking up at the ass crack of dawn. There could be “day divisions” and “night divisions” of companies, which would be able to work parallel to each other & collaborate through meetings at in-between times that can work for all. 

There are other interpersonal factors that I haven’t quite worked out (what if a day person falls in love with a night person? What about schools, should they offer this option too? What would this do to families?) because honestly this is just a hypothetical system I thought of while moaning about how I really really don’t want to wake up early tomorrow. But I do see many potential benefits if all the details are ironed out correctly. Again, if anyone smarter than me is reading this and wants to give their take on this system’s economic/interpersonal/political impacts, I’d love to hear it.

Maybe the nighttime world wouldn’t be quite as active as the daytime one, but it would be a lot more active than it is now. And maybe, through giving people the chance to work & live in a way that is best suited for their individual biology, societies will be able to increase productivity as well as overall quality of life.

Hard tacos actually suck and are the inferior taco delivery device.,33391,1856,2020-09-15 09:42:54,"I just got 3 hard tacos instead of the soft that I ordered and I’m not driving back to fix it but I am increasingly bothered by each bite. Why do people choose this for themselves??

Think about it, plebs. 

No average human can fit a full hard taco shell into their mouths, which mean close to half the bites are just chips and toppings- not to mention that’s only IF you get at least halfway through the taco without it crumbling into a sad Mexican shame salad in the wrapper. Am I supposed to funnel into my mouth like a freaking savage? Or do I get up off the couch(which I was too lazy to leave to get the dang tacos in the first place) to get a bowl or plate to hold  so I can eat it like nachos without embarrassing myself or spilling it. At least with a soft taco I have a CHANCE to get an equal amount of fillings in one bite.

1- I see you haters saying it’s not an unpopular opinion but I read you, and you’re wrong.
2- as much as I would love to hand form a hard tortilla, wrap it in a soft taco, toast the shells in the oven, or otherwise doctor this taco, I’m exhausted as HELL and that’s why I ordered freaking Taco Bell in the first place. Don’t gutter palette shame me, guys- a bitch is tired and nothing good is close or open

3- it’s unreal the amount of people that think I’m just a messy eater. If I was a messy eater, then the fact that the tacos make a mess wouldn’t bother me- instead it’s really hard to eat messy food holding a baby, which is how I eat 90% of my meals.",0

But you can't do it in 6 months. These actors going on talk shows saying they gained 25 pounds in 5 months by eating chicken rice and broccoli sets unbelievably unrealistic expectations. People hear this and think they can do it too, and when they gain about 6 pounds of muscle in 5 months they get discouraged and give up. The open secret of steroid use in the film industry is turning people away from fitness and setting unachievable standards.

EDIT: There seem to be a lot of comments stating this is possible with personal chefs and trainers. It isn’t. This is the lie Hollywood has decided to offer up to the public about why they can’t get their results. They can’t exactly say they took steroids can they? Maximizing muscle growth takes a lot less than you might think. About an hour a day of focused lifting and eating in a slight surplus. They feed us this lie though because most of us can’t afford trainers and chefs, so it’s somewhat believable.

EDIT 2: There’s some people commenting on here about how they know someone or they personally have gained this much muscle in this time frame. No, you haven’t.

Somebody is so willing to die, they are genuinely  that miserable and psychologically tormented in their lives that they will attempt to harm themselves to the point that it will kill them, and not only do they have to stay alive and spend 3 days locked in a ward with other people with varying degrees of mental illness (some get violent).... they have to fucking pay for it!?!? This person has to pay these absolutely insane medical bills on top of continuing to pay to support themselves, a person who didn’t even want to be alive. That’s disgusting to me. That’s so fucking disgusting. After finally telling themselves, “my life isn’t worth living, I’m in agony. I can’t take this anymore.”, saying their final goodbye to the world, they now have to wake up in a hospital to find that their attempt failed and they have to continue living in agony, stay there against their will for hours, told they’re going to be sent to the psychiatric ward, have a police officer sitting at their bedside, get sent to this absolutely atrocious little box of a ward with people who are screaming, backing them into corners and trying to hit them, STAY THERE FOR 3 FUCKING DAYS, only to find when they get home that they’re being billed +$10,000 for the ambulance ride alone. Yeah, that’s a great way to make somebody not want to kill themselves, put them through hell and stick them with a huge bill that makes them feel even more like they’re stuck in a massive pit.

Capes should be THE fashion statement of 2020; don't bother to change my mind.,32985,1760,2019-12-28 07:40:10,"Imagine.

Capes. Once restricted solely to those of royal lineage, and supernatural beings (or of course your rare rich guy),should  become the fashion accessory of 2020. Although capes are not A) readily accessible in a variety of styles and colors and B) Socially acceptable to wear any time other than Halloween, we should make them happen.

Capes are not only a way to keep warm in the dead of winter, but also they make you feel truly badass. Also capes can be considered casual OR  formal. We can have sheer capes for summer and spring, wool and velvet for fall and winter. Capes can spread to each and every corner of the globe. I mean, you could have one for every outfit. Different patterns, colors, shapes, sizes etc.

Plain solid colored shirts are superior to any sort of branded or graphic shirts.,32956,1455,2020-01-20 22:57:29,"A plain solid colored shirt is aesthetically pleasing. It makes you look clean and nice and usually you can find them made well.

If you lived 100+ years ago you would be just as racist as everybody else.,32798,3883,2020-05-18 02:58:14,"A lot of people like to say that they could never racist if they lived 100 years ago, and that is almost certainly not true. The vast majority of people are products of their environments, and they might be completely different people if they were born somewhere else. People are shaped by their environment in so many different ways at a such an early age that if the prevailing thought is that minorities are intellectually inferior you would probably go right along with it without even questioning it because that's how people used to be. 
      I'm not at all saying that any of this acceptable behavior but a lot of the reasons why people thought this was because really thats just how it was. There are obviously exceptions for people who really went against the norm and didn't think these things but these people were a minority. Most people causally thought these things and you would too if you grew up in the 1800s. I'm really sick of people saying that they couldn't because that's just their 21st century mindset working but if you lived 100 years ago you would be just like everyone else.

Edit: Perhaps some of my points are being overlooked so I'll try to be more clear

1. Obviously if you're not white then this does not apply to you as much. If you're black and born in 1820 you aren't really in the same boat (poor choice of words I know) than a white male

2. I am NOT condoning the behavior of the people who lived then and had their own way of thinking. Racism and other forms of intolerance are not acceptable my point is that I might have thought just like them if I was white and living 100+ years ago. 

3. Yes I am American and most of my knowledge and my post stems from that. Non Americans of reddit if things apply to you differently then it may be true but I cannot argue upon something in which I have no legs upon. 

4. To all those who have given examples as to how they broke away from the social norms of their homes maybe you are the few exceptions but at the same time there are a myriad of other people who are unable to be as open minded as you were especially those who lived centuries in the past.",0

"If your child's allergies are so bad that his classmates can't eat what he's allergic to, he shouldn't be going to a public school.",32632,4759,2020-09-15 17:03:52,"When I grew up, we could bring anything to school. I would eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches a lot, or bring nut based products to school. I did this for my entire school life. If a kid had an allergy, they dealt with it, or they didn't go to my school.

Fast forward to me being a dad and sending my kid to school, camp, daycare, etc.

No products with nuts are allowed because some kid might have an allergy. WTF? This became a thing that we were inconveniencing the majority because someone *might* have an allergy. And with nuts, the allergy levels are from nothing to almost death. If a nut is going to kill you, you definitely shouldn't be out in public because eventually, you are going to get hit with some nuts.

Then there are certain years where someone might have a specific allergy and the class teacher will send a letter home saying the kids aren't to have any of THAT product in the food they bring to school.

Some letters home over the years had: shrimp, peaches, and fish. I am sure there were a couple more, but I can't remember them. I'm not saying I would send my kid to school with shrimp or fish, but peaches? When they are in season, why wouldn't I? Or maybe she might have a fruit salad thing...nope, can't do it, the teacher will confiscate it, and call me on it, and I look like the dick.

I get accessibility and all that, but your allergies shouldn't be my problem, and do you know how hard it is to pack up a lunch for your kid (or for yourself even) when your whole life is based on foods that someone *might* be allergic to?

I remember spending HOURS of my time finding snacks for my kid to take to school that had absolutely no nuts, but was still healthy. I'm sorry, I'm not sending her with fruit rollups and other sugary shit. Nuts are actually a really healthy snack, and really kid friendly.

Finally, are you parents with kids with allergies going to pay for all the parents of the kids that have to buy alternative foods to what they normally would send their kid to school with? I doubt it, so why make YOUR problem into OUR problem?

Kids with allergies who prohibit my kid from eating what they want shouldn't go to public school.",0

I typed comments with the same tone that I speak, and it *did not* go well with any redditors at all. Even when I was just joking, or being sarcastic, or just poking fun at something, I got heavily downvoted. If I shared something personal without that tone which establishes that I'm a happy, positive, nice person, it always became content for other subs. I deleted that, went off Reddit for a while, came back.

In the last few weeks, I've acted like a redditor. When I'm posting comments in a happy go lucky, positive, 'hey look at me I'm a chill down to earth dude who's also thankful for what he has and is not braggy and is funny without trying too hard', then I'm getting upvoted like crazy. Even trivial comments which don't add much to the conversation get upvoted, so do posts which don't have any opinions whatsoever. If you're posting about a game or a tv show and you establish right from the beginning that you absolutely LOVE it, followed by a tiny critique, you get upvoted.

The minute you post your whole opinion, without *trying* to hard to be super positive and just sharing your thoughts about it, how maybe you didn't find that game or movie or tv show too good, or maybe point out the flaws or loopholes, or anything that is even remotely off the path from the general *fans* of the content, you get super downvoted.

You don't even need to post something hateful or offensive. Just disagree with the general opinion on a thread filled with only positives about something, without being rude or hateful or sarcastic, you'll be downvoted.

Redditors only love others who type in the exact manner that they want Reddit to be. They don't want this to turn into Facebook or Instagram or Tumblr, and they know how they want Reddit to be, so they force you to turn into *The perfect* redditor, who says things in a particular way, always justifies their thoughts or opinions if they want to even slightly go against the general opinion. 

Biggest example is the emoji use. If you use an emoji, just one, even though your comment makes sense 100% and is factually correct and is the best thing that anyone has every typed on the internet, you're gonna get downvoted. 

If you type about your achievement, but without the obligatory, 'I'm not much of an artist' or 'I only have been practicing for 3 weeks and I'm not really good at it, but here is my...', then you're judged as being braggy, instantly, and you'll be screenshotted and posted on other subs (hasn't happened to be, but I've seen it happen).

"If Tinder is implementing a height setting for men, they should implement a weight setting for women.",32547,2784,2019-03-31 00:58:45,"Tinder just announced a setting for men to show their height, under the reasoning that too many men lie about their height on the app and as they put it, are ""height fishing"" women. I can just about guarantee they won't do a fucking thing  about weight for women. I have friends who have been fat fished. That's essentially the same damn thing. Why the hell should guys show their height if women won't show their weight. It's so fucking dumb to me. A girl doesn't like a guy because of his height? ""You go girl!"", ""Girl power!"", blah blah blah. A guy doesn't like a girl because she's fat? ""Asshole!"", ""So misogynistic!"", blah blah blah. It annoys the living fuck out of me that women aren't held to the same societal standards regarding attraction that men are.

Let me be clear, **I have no issue with a woman if she is fat. I am just not attracted to it. Also, it is totally okay with me if a woman isn't attracted to me because I'm 5'9""**

Yes I'm aware that the height setting is optional, similar to Bumble, and it's not as bad as something like Hinge where you're required to put your height, whereas women aren't required to put their weight. While this is about Tinder's new settings, I think it really opens up the societal double standard regarding attraction to the opposing sex and it just pisses me the fuck off.

"Men have ""fragile egos"" because the average woman doesn't know how to tell men things in ways that make them want to listen",31959,4522,2020-07-08 11:34:11,"Before the whining about ""mansplaining"" begins, I'm a woman, so don't waste your nail polish.

I hear too often how women ""can't tell him"" various things bothering her, because ""he has a fragile ego."" No, you can't tell him these things because you're attacking him and being hateful when you tell him.

You also can't tell him things because you only tell him negative things. You're ungrateful.

If you tell a man, ""I like it when a guy gives me chocolates,"" he'll probably give you chocolates. If you snap at him that maybe you'd forgive him if his lazy ass got up off of the couch and got you some chocolates... You're likely to get only a big argument.

If he gets you the wrong kind of chocolates, and you tell him so with all the fury in your rotten little soul, you're to blame when you get no more chocolates.

If you tell him how much you appreciate how hard he tried, and actually, you know, appreciate that he DID try... And then say that your favorites are X type, but you will enjoy these today because being from him makes them special, you'll get your favorite next time for sure.

And before you stamp your entitled little foot and screech that he should just listen to you no matter how you say it, maybe you should consider the fact that that's the sort of thing a spoiled child would say, not an adult. If you can't be bothered to be thoughtful towards him, you're a spoiled, demanding brat, not a woman.

Appreciate him like loving adults appreciate each other. Consider his feelings, and stop demanding consideration you don't give. Cut the double standard. Don't abuse your partner. Don't talk to him in ways that you'd never tolerate *from* him.

"Lab grown diamonds should completely destroy the diamond mining industry.

If the marketing machine was just as strong in the other direction, we’d all prefer lab grown because it perfectly displays man’s power over the elements.  

I know a lot of people are abandoning diamonds altogether In their engagement rings, which I totally respect, but I still think diamonds are a beautiful and worthy stone. If lab grown can make them cheaper and more ethically it’s literally just buying into the marketing that drives mined diamond sales.

A bad teacher has a worse influence on society than a drug dealer,31634,2040,2019-08-13 23:26:40,"A bad teacher can make hundreds of people hate a subject, or even school, for their whole life. This means while an average drug dealer has bad influence on society and on their clients, if we compare individually ONE teacher and ONE drug dealer, it's debatable if having a bad influence on the education and professional life of hundreds of children is worse or not than selling drugs to a smaller fraction of the people. I think it is.

Furthermore, a child giving up school while young because of a teacher is way more likely to die young or to go to jail, or even to become a drug dealer, which is quite ironic here, because if a bad teacher caused only one dealer, he has had a worse influence than a dealer. For those of you who will say that drug dealers actually kill people when teachers don't, a lot of people turn to drugs (excluding medicinal) in indirect consequence of quitting school, which is not to blame only on teachers, but they should take a part of the blame, and a huge one in some cases

Ps: I am not defending drug dealing, I am just COMPARING it to teachers.

All recipes should use metric measurements,31445,3524,2020-04-06 18:55:25,"Not ounces of milk, stick of butter or cups (fuck cup measurements BTW)

If I'm baking a cake or bread, I want exact measurements. It's fucking science. Butter comes in blocks or long sticks, how the fuck am I supposed to know how much a 'stick of butter' is?

Cups vary so wildly. On some video recipes, it's the proper measuring cup, on some it's a literal mug. Do you know how big of a difference that is?

Last thing I want to do is Google 'how much cups =a gram/ml' 

It literally cost nothing to use metric measurements for recipes, unlike if I were to say 'change all roads in US from miles to km' it'll cost millions to replace all the signage. 

Another point many of you had mentioned I figured I add in here, tablespoons and teaspoons. Are we talking the fucking tablespoon for 10-year-olds with Spongebob on it or the one they use in castles?

Being able to say “I didn’t respond/didn’t answer your call because I just didn’t feel like it” should be normalized and people shouldn’t take it personally.,31381,988,2020-07-20 23:46:49,"It’s not uncommon to think of any excuse possible to get out of an unwanted conversation/phone call/meetup/etc. I personally have always been someone who feels the need to think of a perfect excuse as to not offend the other person. “Sorry I was working” when really, I was watching Netflix. “Oh sorry I missed your call! I don’t have good cell coverage where I am” etc.

However, saying something like “sorry I missed your call, I don’t feel like talking at the moment” is something that I know a lot of people would take personally. When I’ve responded like this to people, they also always assume something’s wrong, that I’m upset, angry at them, etc. when really I’m either just busy or not in the mood to talk to anyone cause I’m just doing my own thing.

**EDIT**: To the people saying, ""Don't give any explanation, just say ""sorry I missed your call"" and leave it at that."" My whole point is that sometimes, people will press to know why you were busy and why you missed their call or what you were doing. In this case, you should be able to say ""sorry, just didn't feel like talking to anyone!"" Even if you say ""Sorry I can't talk, I'm busy"" people will most likely try to call you back at a time when they think you won't be busy. So instead, you should just be able to say that you weren't in the mood to talk.

The American style of tipping is a toxic culture that should be abolished,31084,5553,2019-12-07 17:17:38,"Now, before I continue, I would like to say that I ain't American, but I have read about how tipping works there from reddit. Thus, according to Internet law, I'm an expert on the matter. (In all seriousness though, just correct me if I'm wrong)

- First of all, you guys say that tipping is necessary in order for workers to earn above minimum wage. However, isn't it a rule in most establishments that if the employee doesn't make enough through tips, their boss should cover the rest? What do you know, apparently untipped waiters aren't suffering from lack of cash. You might say that if tipping is abolished, the cost of food in restaurants will rise. So what? You are already paying extra through your bloody tips, just divert that cash to a higher price of a meal. Just make things a bit more simple. 

- Apparently, there is also cases of employers 'stealing' their workers tips or forcing them to 'share' it. Like how certain restaurants force their waiters to equally share their hard earned tips with their fellow workers. What the fuck is that? So if I work hard, treat my client extra super special awesome and received a glorious 50% percent tip for my hard work, I must share it with lazy Harry who sleeps in the storeroom every chance he get? And don't tell me that waiters have to share their tips with the cooks for the sake of 'fairness'. After all, don't cooks earn above the min wage? 

- Unlike most people apparently, I love maths. Damn, how I loved it, and I was pretty good at it. Nevertheless, it doesn't mean that I want to do a freaking mental calculation everytime I finish a meal. Like wtf people, I wanna chill after I finish dinner. And don't you people start giving me pointers on simple ways to calculate how much to tip a person. I find it twisted that tipping is so ingrained in American culture that you guys make a literal rule for it. Japanese student bow to their teachers respectfully before starting class, but any American asshole who gives below 20% for a tip is the scum of the earth and is a reserved a special VIP room in hell. 

- Plus, tipping culture apparently breeds a sense of entitlement among some in the service industry. I've read stories about waiters and waitresses who turn their nose away from what they presume is a 'low' tip and even 'subtly' hint that they should get a higher amount. Like bitch, you are literally getting money from someone whom isn't entitled to pay you squat and you got the audacity to be choosy about it. 

- Why only waiters get to be tipped? Why not the janitors, the maids or the garbage men? Some of them have even tougher jobs then waiters. They don't get tipped. I mean, when have you guys even said thank you to the guys who scrubbed your toilet bowl squeaky clean? Not to mention how some waiter may be lucky enough to earn double or triple above the minimum wage if they work at a particularly affluent restaurant. A bit unfair isn't it?

- I feel like the easiest way to solve this problem is for the American legislation to get amended so that the workers in the service industry get paid according to the minimum wage. So why are you all so stupid that you can't figure out this simple solution? 

- Now, I'm not saying that tipping is bad. However, it should be used to show appreciation rather than being something mandatory. Hell, some restaurants even include tipping in the bill as a gratuitous fee. How presumptuous is that? Crap, I'm straying of point. Anyway, like I was saying, tipping should be a choice on the customer's behalf, to pay for some particularly outstanding service from their waiter. It shouldn't be freaking corrupted by being made socially compulsory. 


You guys might be wondering why the hell I decided to post this. I don't live in America, nor do I plan to. This has nothing to do with me whatsoever, so why am I being a busybody? Well, it's because this annoys me. It's really, really annoying on how this whole issue is so stupid and unnecessarily overcomplicated. Of course, this ain't the only time America decided to be 'different' in order to separate themselves from the rest of the world only to end up looking like idiots. Remember the imperial system crap? Similarly, this whole issue is such a big pain in the ass for everybody that I internally cringe everytime I think about. So, I decided to vent about it by bashing the Americans. That's all.







Edit 1: Most of you talk about how tipping is a good thing because servers get more money than if they totally depend on min wage. That working as a server is so horrible that nobody will do it if not for the tips. Well, guess what? There are other shitty jobs out there and they don't get tipped for it so this seems pretty unfair to me. Basically, servers want this culture to stay, despite they getting less than minimum, because its better for them compared to the customers.

Edit 2: What's up with Europe and shitty service? You guys keep talking about how tipping incentives servers in America and you use your experience with Europe to prove that. This is not a thing in Southeast Asia, where I actually live, cuz people provide good service here WITHOUT EXPECTING TIPS. You Westerners are seriously dissapointing me here.

Edit 3: My god, you servers are salty af clinging to your precious tips just because you want to enjoy a lavish lifestyle that other minimum wage workers don't enjoy. You guys are a bunch of whiny entitled crybabies.

Edit 4: One thing I feel like I have to remind you guys is that I'm not hating on tipping. Instead I feel that we should only tip when we get great service, not average service. Unfortunately, though its purely voluntary, Americans are socially pressured to tip, even for shitty service. This is what I dislike.",0
"Whether 18 or 40, women who have sexual relationships with 13 year olds need to be immediately hunted down by the law and put in 20 years prison, just like when its men doing the same thing.",31050,2347,2019-01-24 01:19:25,"https://preview.redd.it/zapcm4pe97c21.jpg?width=426&auto=webp&s=5da2b71aa1fd7350e23e933a19a84b7133b96a68

The double standard makes it okay for women to commit to this kind of behavior, and we dont punish them equally, we're building two different social classes into the law. Why does anyone think its ""just different"" for an older woman to have sex with a male compared for an older man?

https://youtu.be/eM28YFrMdfI?t=9

here's a youtube video of SNL making a joke about male students with female teachers, for instance.

There's actually reasons for making a valid reverse argument based on human development.

Girls mature at 10 and boys have to wait til 20, for some things. (google brain data)

Girls reach maximum (adult) height at 13-15, boys gets a 14-18 period to reach it. Again showing that females mature sooner than males. 

Girls are superior at emotional intelligence to boys, and EI is defined as the ability to read and understand others, their emotions, their thoughts, their intentions, etc. (google again)

Therefore it would seem obvious they'd know more rather than less. Because of all these verifiable facts, a 13 year old boy and 18 year old girl is LEAGUES apart compared to a 13 year old girl and 18 year old boy, which would still be sick and disgusting. Since this case deals with the reverse, and since people are praising him and her, it shows the double standard and unpopularity. It would be unanimous for an older male adult with a young girl to be considered a disgusting pedophile rapist, but on this one people equivocate because the roles are reversed. 

 the double standard throws child-males to the predatory women-wolves.

Neither is acceptable. The double standard simply makes it sickening and worse, especially in light of the fact that it is MALES who are underdeveloped for that age period. If there were a progressive victim stack, MALES should be ahead of FEMALES on the list because of the developmental delay.

Edit: JFC this blew up. 

#edit 2: Omg thanks for the gold guys, I really appreciate it! Omg I also got gilding! Thank you stranger. I am so blessed. I love you!

edit 3: Google the phrase ""science data brain girls mature 10 years"". I dont have time for idiocy, name calling, accusations, threats, etc, any or all of which are completely baseless or trolling. Claiming I'm pro rape and pro pedophilia for denouncing both and also calling science into the equation as why ""its actually WORSE because boys are less mentally developed and thus more easily victimized"" is not support.

Being a piece of shit accuser is something you'll deal with on your own time, not mine.

Go after people in comments who say things like this if you're so triggered and so retarded.

>its absolutely disgusting how warped sexuality has become. your body is not a temple, its a sack of bacteria. sex is not a sacred ritual and nothing is lost when you have sex for the first time. get over yourselves. sex is as common and normal a practice as eating, sleeping and shitting.

>also, id like to know, at what age should one stop being attracted to young people? and i say stop because everyone is attracted to children at some point in their life, usually when they are a child.

>should it also be just as taboo to be 13 and want to fuck a 20 year old? why or why not?

>society does more damage to people based on judgement of a sexual act than the sexual act itself and its disgusting. you should honestly be ashamed of yourself for expressing and enforcing this opinion.

For anyone who needs a heartwarming story after reading the abhorrent positivity towards this situation:

>I live in aus and about 11 years ago I used to be friends with a girl who was obsessed with America, so much so that she signed up to a camp leader in the US for one summer. She went over there an had an inappropriate ‘romance’ with a camp attendee. He was 15 and she was 20. The boys parents found out and had her charged. She went to a women’s prison in Iowa. Her mother back in aus had to spend 30k on lawyers and fly over to the US to try and get her sent back home. She is now a registered sex offender and has to let every current and future employee know. She is not allowed to work with minors or vulnerable people. She is banned from ever travelling to the US. IMO she got what she deserved.

"Dick shaming should be taken as seriously as all other types of shaming, specifically slut shaming and fat shaming.",30680,2604,2020-02-28 10:02:29,"I just saw an interview with a woman (reality show) where she used her fingers to suggest her ex lover was not well endowed. The audience, mostly female, erupted in a round of applause and laughter. Yet no one would clap and cheer if a man gestured that his ex wife’s breasts droop down to her stomach. 

As a female, I’m tired of the hypocrisy. It’s still completely acceptable to speak about a man and his genitals. Dick size is such an easy go to when bashing a man, or, conversely, when praising a man. But to attack a woman for her weight or praise a woman for having nice breasts and/or buttocks is absolutely unacceptable.",0
"If your first thought after seeing a man being playful and nice to his own daughter or a kid are that the man must be creep, you are a horrible person and a misandrist",30641,1669,2020-08-27 22:23:09,"(READ THE EDIT! I am not targeting the woman specifically. I am saying that this line of thought should be considered as misandry and not just ‘I was raised by the society to have this bias’ kind of thing. Holy crap, so much splaining to a person expressing an issue that affects men. No wonder men don’t feel like expressing themselves.)

Saw a post on reddit in which a woman became suspicious when she saw a man playing with his daughter at a park. She immediately thought of the man as a creep and a predator. And she then blamed the society for her thinking. Yeah, like that was the first time she saw a father and daughter together to realise sexist views...This is like saying people of certain colour or religion are criminals because all media has shown me about them is crime. This thinking is obviously considered, and is, very racist.

No one in their right mind ever thinks about creepy stuff as a first thought when they see a man playing with his own daughter unless they have been living in a hive mind or constantly staying in groups where men are always called predators, misogynists and bad human beings. 

Also, no one pointed out the misandry in such thinking and she never mentioned how she will improve upon her misandrist thinking and why it was bad. Instead of actually saying that thinking like this is bad and sexist she only says it’s what society does to you. This helps to  a subtle line of thought among people that it’s ok to think like this and it’s normal because ‘society made you do this’. Misandry needs to be pointed out more. This was a great example of how hive minds and group think can lead to biases in humans and how social media promotes them.

Edit: Yes, I have read the post that I have used as an example! And I have corrected one sentence which I have clearly misinterpreted and I was wrong. I know in the post she mentions her thoughts were ‘biased’...even after knowing the girl was the mans daughter btw. That is the whole point of my post, to point out that this immediate thinking that men being near kids (even their own) as creepy is not just a societal bias, it’s misandrist. And blaming society for this thought process even after being a grown up and having your own kids is horrible and affects men (clearly seen from the experiences shared in this post). My post is not meant to target the person, it’s targeted at the thought. I want people to start taking this negative stereotype created by hive minds about men as misandrist and wrong. The thought, when applied to all men, is sexist and propagating the idea makes you horrible.",0

The death of a young adult is generally sadder than the death of a child.,30271,1082,2019-04-29 23:35:33,"Generally speaking, everyone seems to think that a life that ends at its very beginning is the saddest thing ever. Frankly, I believe that dying of sickness or an accident when you're a young adult (20-35 years old more or less) is way out more brutal.

The child leaves almost nothing behind. It's terrible for the family, that's for sure, but at the same time that person hasn't brought anything to the world yet and most of children don't even know what's happening while they're dying.   On the other hand a young adult leaves friends, sometimes a companion or children. They had something to live for, absolute lucidity on the matter and a half fulfilled life that they will never be able to put a good ending to.

I don't mean to say that children deserve more to die than young adults, that's obvious, but generally speaking I think that the death of a person who already lived half a life and leaves it all behind  is way out sadder than just a kid that has no or very little conscience of what's happening and most of the time does not have something to live for other than the only fact of living.

African Americans are just that AMERICANS. We’re not connected at all. It’s just like a white American trying to claim they’re somehow Irish because they great great grandad was Irish. 

A lot of them also seem to make a big deal about it and say “oh but we were stripped of our identity and culture.” Yeah that’s true and it’s sad what happened to those African slaves but it happened and now you just aren’t African AT ALL.

It is better to remain silent and be assumed to be a fool than to speak and remove all doubt.

People these days just talk and talk, and then wait their turn to talk some more while pretending to listen to what other people have to say.  Nobody listens.  

People also have a terrible habit of talking about things they don't know a goddamn thing about, just for the sake of having something to say.  People are too afraid to say ""I don't know"" like its some kind of vulgar phrase.  People talk before they think, and act before they think entirely too much.

If what you're about to say doesn't contribute meaningfully to the conversation around you -- why talk?  If what's being talked about doesn't apply to you, or doesn't provide you any benefit, why participate?

I really don't think that the whole ""quiet kid"" stereotype holds any value -- I think its symptomatic of a population that just flaps their gums way too much and never really has anything meaningful to say.  

You give a lot of yourself away when you talk, you show your hand -- you allow people to make their judgments about you, assess your weaknesses, and manipulate you.  People you don't even know exist probably think you're an asshole because of one thing you said out of turn one time like 5 years ago -- and you don't even know about it, because you probably never think about the things you say or who you say them to.  You just talk for the sake of talking.

In a world of chaos, math is supreme, calculations will never change. Sure, maybe the US education system absolutely fucks over everyone's perception of math by making it insufferable. But what the teachers told us countless times is true, ""math is in every day life, and you may be using y=mx+b without even knowing it one day"". Maybe forcing us to learn advanced mathematics is what makes our perception of it so twisted, as does handing out sheets with 50 algebraic equations to solve at the start of class as a warmup for a new lesson when you just covered the subject of the 50 you're solving the day before.

"Children under the age of 13 should not be allowed on social media, or have their own device",29391,2228,2020-07-24 11:08:54,"Devices

Growing up I didn't have my own phone or tablet til I could pay for it with my own money. I got a job as a dishwasher when I was 14 and paid for my first phone and it felt great. Now I take a look around me and take a look at my family and see that a lot of children have their own devices. My younger sister recently got my mom's old phone and my younger brothers use my dad's iPad constantly. I understand times are changing and a new generation is growing but I still don't think kids should be allowed to have their own devices til they can responsibly pay for it or take care of it. The devices they use are constantly needing to be cleaned and in bad condition. Personally when I have kids of my own, they won't be on mobile devices til they are at least 10.

Social media

Social media can ruin the idea of growing up in a split second. YouTube, Instagram, Facebook etc can all have a positive impact on young minds teaching them things and all that, but it will mostly be negative if they use it. They will get addicted and want to watch YouTube all day and one wrong search can lead to uncomfortable conversations and things they shouldn't know until they are older. My younger brothers and cousins are watching YouTube constantly and the stuff they watch is extremely weird and in some cases scary. I worry that it's taking away from their child hood and just mind numbing them.
Thanks for reading if you got this far.

Edit: I have seen a lot of people who got a device at a younger age around ages nine through eleven for communication with their parents I do not have an issue with this.

The dating world would be better if culture supported women asking men out more than men asking out women.,29354,2231,2020-08-31 02:50:14,"The reason for this is that women are MORE SELECTIVE.

Think about it. Whenever there is a group of people deciding what to do, it's more efficient to have the most picky person decide, since their choice is most likely to be accepted by the other members. Otherwise everyone else has to work to find something the picky person will accept, and that's excess work.

Well that's EXACTLY what happens in the dating world. Women are more picky, but rather than take in upon themselves to decide who they want to date and act upon it, they more often expect the men to come to them, creating more work overall.

Let's use numbers to illustrate. Let's say (hypothetically) that a man will agree to date 20% of women, and women will agree to date 10% of men.

In this case, if a woman is looking to date, we would expect a match after she asks out 5 men she approves of.

If instead she makes the men do all the work, we would expect a match after 10 men ask her out.

Even a hybrid is more efficient than this. If the woman asks out 2 men, 6 men asking her out in addition are then required for there to be an expected match. That's 8 attempts, which is less than 10.

Clearly, in a world where women are more selective, allocating the work to men just complicates the process. Since women are the ones who have a narrower selection of potential mates, let them decide who they want, since they have a worse chance of being turned down.",0
Alcohol is an absolutely terrible drug and should not be glorified in society.,29328,2283,2019-05-10 03:15:01,"Seriously, what other drug can you DIE from withdrawal? How often do you hear the latest car crash due to alcohol intoxication? It's a mind altering substance that frequently makes people aggressive, unaware (Which people use to get others very drunk just to use as a grounds of rape), uncoordinated, ect.

Even if I also enjoy a beer or two once in a while, and I don't shame people for enjoying what they enjoy. You do you.

But the fact that society as a whole is constantly shoving it into media, advertising, and stores without recognizing the very real dangers of it is bewildering to me.

Running as an adult should be socially accepted,29316,2713,2019-06-02 10:11:20,"I'm not talking about running sportively, I'm talking about running just to get somewhere faster. Why can't I do it without people judging me? I have the body condition and energy to do so and I don't want to spend 15min walking. 

Everytime an adult is seen running, people automatically think that he is late, or that he is running from something dangerous, or that something is wrong in general. People are limited to walking.

The vast majority of people are only supportive about your mental illness until you exhibit symptoms,29271,893,2020-07-28 05:12:04,"This is so common and I never see anyone talk about it. People love to claim that they will support friends and family members through their mental illness, but as soon as they exhibit a symptom, it’s blaming and abandonment. Here’s an example I’ve seen: your parent claims to be supportive when you get diagnosed with depression, says they are there for you, you fall into a depressive episode and stay in bed all day, suddenly you’re just lazy, ungrateful, and unmotivated. When you tell them your depressed, you get met with eye rolls and sighs. This is extremely common. You go into a relationship and the other person knows you have a panic disorder. One day, you’re having an episode and snap at them while in an agitated state, and it leads to them complaining about how that was uncalled for and you’re just being a moody bitch. No, I’m not saying anyone is obligated to be supportive or be your therapist, but do not pretend to be supportive towards someone with a mental illness when you will jump ship at the first symptomatic occurrence. Don’t claim to support friends/family members with mental illnesses, and then get mad at them when they show symptoms and make them feel even worse. (Disclaimer: I AM NOT SAYING YOU HAVE TO SUPPORT SOMEONE WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS I AM SAYING PEOPLE PRETEND TO AND THEN DO THE OPPOSITE OF BEING SUPPORTIVE)",0

"The body acceptance movement should be about height, not weight.",29192,5053,2019-06-17 13:42:27,"You can control your weight, but you cannot control your height. If you have weight problems you should try and help them. I can’t tell you how to live your life but you shouldn’t accept something that could greatly shorten your life if you can use hard work and determination to solve it. I’ve learned to accept my height. I can’t change it, so why stress about it? I just have to live with it because there’s nothing I can do about it. Weight, that’s a different story


EDIT: a lot of people are saying “why not both”, but the answer is in the post. Being obese has a direct correlation to disease and living a shorter amount of time, so I feel like it shouldn’t be accepted (with the exception of metabolic diseases that cause obesity)

Instagram models are creepy,29181,1832,2020-07-28 12:35:57,"That's right, I said it. As a guy who likes girls, IG ""models"" are creepy as hell. Their profile is only pictures of themselves. They have nothing going on in their lives. They have no intrest or hobbies. Only selfies. No matter how attractive they seem at first, I see 1000 pictures of just them and feel nauseated. 1000 pictures of them in different environments but it's all about them. The subject matter of the photo is always focused on them. To me it looks like all they think about is themselves. If you talked to someone who could only hold a conversation about themselves, it would be off putting. I view social media pages the same way. What are you expressing? A picture is worth a thousand words but a million selfies is worth nothing.

You ketchup fuckers should have to ask for ketchup, not me.

Putting ketchup on steak should be a capital offense and you should be sent to a reeducation camp. 

It's fat dumb people sauce. Its the keystone or natty light of sauce. Its putrid odor is reminiscent of filthy hooker perspiration. You can literally judge a person by how much ketchup they consume.

"I’m so sick of people undermining and dismissing the mental health of 13-14 year olds, because they are “too young” to be suffering from mental illnesses.",29156,1946,2020-01-18 22:34:29,"It’s the same shit you see a lot, memes made about 13 and 14 year old girls thinking they know about true sadness, heartbreak, anxiety, depression and what not. Young teens don’t get taken seriously enough, made to believe that they simply “aren’t old enough” to process such complex emotions, so much so they their claims of being “depressed” boils down to being attention-seeking and looking for validation. I’m so sick of this. I’m not 13/14, but I KNOW FOR A FACT that what many kids are going through is in fact, real, and not some “complex” concept that they aren’t old enough to understand. More and more young teenagers suffer from social anxiety, depression, and low self esteem, and we cannot keep undermining and dismissing what they feel. At that age, it can ruin so much. People of all ages should seek help for mental illnesses, but more often than not, what children suffer with don’t even get taken seriously as a mental illness. And I hate that. At what point do they get taken seriously? 15? 16? Is that when they are mature enough to have a mental illness?


Edit: 
some background info: I had suffered from depression at a young age but got help through therapy. Also, my sister who had just turned 13, suffered from later-diagnosed severe depression, social anxiety, separation anxiety and generalised anxiety that built up slowly but escalated so fast out of control. Everyday was a struggle, everything was a struggle, and this was for many months. Without going into too much detail, basically our family was struggling to help her ourselves, but it was almost impossible to  find outside help (because of her anxiety, my sister was so afraid to seek help). It changed my outlook on mental illness, and it went from a point where I couldn’t see a future to when my sister had finally successfully reclaimed a somewhat normal life through intervention and counselling. Many times I wonder where I went wrong, were there signs I missed? Did I dismiss her feelings and invalidate her? At what point did it lead to this? I blame myself sometimes for not paying enough attention and for not taking my sister seriously enough, so I wanted this make this post to say that please listen when someone is struggling. It may save their life.",0
Apple not including a power adapter wasn't about reducing E-waste,29154,2593,2020-10-16 15:35:19,"Before Apple could make a public statement, they were already given a defense strategy by fanboys. Tech reviewers made videos about the no charger rumor. And soon enough everyone was repeating the same E-waste counter argument. "" Why would they include it. Everyone already has a charger. Apple is probably doing it to help the environment"". 

While it may be true everyone has a power adapter. Only the people with an 11 pro have the USB-C power adapter. You know, the power adapter for the charging cable included with the phone. Most of the iPhone 12 sells will come from people who don't have an 11 pro. So how much E-waste is really being reduced?

If they truly cared about reducing E-waste why don't they offer some type of recycling program for your old power adapter? That power adapter is basically useless now. New chargers could be made with the help of old ones. Wait... Because it was never about reducing E-waste. Apple will ship nearly the same amount of power adapters. The difference being the amount of money they will make by not including it.

But lately I've been going to the comments expecting an informative and sincere conversation about a rather serious post only to find (yet again) another 4 pages of jokes or one drawn out and exhausted pun. Sometimes I feel like I should laugh at the cleverness of some. But it happens so often and in so many posts that I find myself never laughing at all in the comments anymore. Not unless there's just a golden moment. I've even begun to roll my eyes the moment I open the comments and see that the top comment is a joke. I NEVER ROLL MY EYES. At anything.

Alcohol is one of the worst drugs and shouldn’t have the social acceptance it does.,28502,2652,2019-03-16 15:02:54,"Alcohol is deceptively innocent especially to people that haven’t done many drugs. It slows down reaction times, clouds judgment and pretty much makes you worse at everything.

There is a huge focus on how alcohol effects driving but people don’t seem to care about how it effects the rest of your their life  and we focus on driving because it requires  us to be on the ball 100% of the time and the consequences are deadly. 

I really don’t have any data to support the rest, but my personal opinion is that getting drunk more than once a week will lower IQ and job performance as well as performances on anything skill based ie.  video games, sports, music, driving, dancing etc.  over time you will become a shadow of the person you could have been if you weren’t drinking and to clarify I don’t mean a glass of wine at dinner or a single beer but anything more than a SLIGHT buzz regularly.

Cardi B should be arrested and treated like the criminal she is.,27739,2870,2019-12-03 13:06:31,"She straight admitted to drugging and robbing men. She may have changed since then, or maybe she hasnt idk or care. She might have apologized and “righted her wrongs” but All I know is this.

If a man (especially one of Cardi B’s status) were to come on video - and go onto explain how he lured women into his hotel room - drugged them - robbed them and left. He would be locked up for life

So why isn’t Cardi getting the exact same treatment? Why isn’t anything happening? Why is she just getting a free pass?

It’s bullshit and she deserves equal treatment for her actions.

Edit:

To make more clear. I understand u can’t incriminilaize someone without any actual evidence. But for example

Drake

He gets on camera and admits to drugging and robbing multiple women. What do u think would happen to his career or life? It would be completely ruined. He would probably end up having an investigation on him as well. 

But Cardi?

Oh no no no - this woman is perfectly clean and can get away with literally anything

Edit 2:

People seem to think I want her in jail - not necessarily. 

I understand that just because she said she did it - does not make her automatically guilty but again and maybe the title is a bit misleading on this but-

She should be TREATED appropriately. Or at the very least it should be more achknowledged and not just glossed over by her fan base and a large sum of people. 

I don’t really give a shit about her in terms of getting arrested or put in jail. I just want her to experience the same reapercussions that a male or maybe even another female would get from going on camera in 2018/2019 whenever it was - and then stating how u drugged and robbed men/women. 

Maybe 15 years ago u could get away with this - but with 2019’s cancel culture insanity I find it insane that this hasn’t been brought up when discussing Cardi - all that is brought up is 

“Omg queeeeen okrrrrrrrrrrrrr such a racial role model and figure!!!!!”

Like no. It would be different if she was singing about it jokingly - or even if she said it in a more joking manner but no she was serious (for her) in the video

I just think for 2019 - she should be treated a lot differently than she is now

"I don't care about school shootings, and neither should you.",27544,5846,2019-02-21 09:28:40,"Using my backup account for this opinion because why the fuck wouldn't I? If I contended this in public, I'd get mowed down by angry reprimands and disappointed looks. But from an objective and statistical standpoint, it's nonsensical to give a flying fuck about school shootings. Here's why.

&#x200B;

**1,153.** That's how many people have been killed in school shootings since 1965, per [The Washington Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/?utm_term=.094b0180ee3a) This averages out to approximately **23 deaths per year** attributable to school shootings. Below are some other contributing causes of death, measured in annual confirmed cases.

1. **68 - Terrorism.** Let's compare school shootings to my favorite source of wildly disproportionate panic: terrorism. Notorious for being emphatically overblown after 2001, terrorism claimed 68 deaths on United States soil in 2016. This is **three times as many** deaths as school shootings. [Source](https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death)
2. **3,885 - Falling.** Whether it be falling from a cliff, ladder, stairs, or building (unintentionally), falls claimed 3,885 US lives in 2011. The amount of fucks I give about these preventable deaths are equivalent to moons orbiting around Mercury. So why, considering a framework of logic and objectivity, should my newsfeed be dominated by events which claim **169 times less** lives than falling?   [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/06/deaths-mortality-rates-cause-death-2011)
3. **80,058 - Diabetes.** If you were to analyze relative media exposure of diabetes against school shootings, the latter would dominate by a considerable margin. Yet, despite diabetes claiming 80,000 more lives annually (**3480 : 1 ratio**), mainstream media remains fixated on overblowing the severity of school shootings. [Source](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/019.pdf)

&#x200B;

And, just for fun, here's some wildly unlikely shit that's **more likely to kill you** than being shot up in a school.

* **Airplane/Spacecraft Crash** \- 26 deaths
* **Drowning in the Bathtub** \- 29 deaths
* **Getting Struck by a Projectile** \- 33 deaths
* **Pedestrian Getting Nailed by a Lorry** \- 41 deaths
* **Accidentally Strangling Yourself -** 116 deaths

&#x200B;

Now, here's a [New York Times Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/us/school-shootings-drills-risks.html) titled ""*New Reality for High School Students: Calculating the Risk of Getting Shot.*"" Complete with a picture of an injured student, this article insinuates that school shootings are common enough to warrant serious consideration. Why else would you need to calculate the risk of it occurring? What it conveniently leaves out, however, is the following (excerpt from the [Washington Post:](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/school-shootings-are-extraordinarily-rare-why-is-fear-of-them-driving-policy/2018/03/08/f4ead9f2-2247-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html?utm_term=.c7e601c50733))

>That means the statistical likelihood of any given public school student being killed by a gun, in school, on any given day since 1999 was **roughly 1 in 614,000,000**. And since the 1990s, shootings at schools have been getting less common. The chance of a child being shot and killed in a public school is extraordinarily low.

&#x200B;

In percentages, the probability of a randomly-selected student getting shot tomorrow is 0.00000000016%. It's a number so remarkably small that every calculator I tried automatically expresses it in scientific notation. Thus the probability of a child getting murdered at school is, by all means and measures, inconsequential. There is absolutely no reason for me or you to give a flying shit about inconsequential things, let alone national and global media.",0
Schools train smart people to be lazy.,27515,1157,2020-09-07 23:50:20,"This is gonna sound arrogant at first but hear me out. From kindergarten to early high school I've always had a very easy time. In English, my writing skills were always better than other kids. In math I never struggled to comprehend new concepts and was always getting ahead of the material. Even in band I somehow got the ""best of class"" rating, despite barely ever practicing my instrument. So the whole time I wasn't having to work hard at all, never studying, and barely doing homework because I knew I could just ace tests. But of course it didn't stay like this forever. In the last couple years of high school and now in college, I've reached my limits and now am having to actually work hard to be successful. And as a result of early schooling, my study skills are terrible, I suck at budgeting my time and getting work done efficiently, and I always procrastinate horribly. These are arguably the most important things to learn in school, as they apply to basically anything in life, and I completely skipped over them.

TLDR: Higher knowledge/comprehension is good in the short term, but it'll eventually plateau and leave you with poor work ethic and study skills.

There is nothing wrong with finding other people attractive when in a relationship but you’re an asshole if you feel the need to continuously tell your partner about it.,27354,1001,2020-07-22 17:39:09,"Recently people have been saying how fucked up it is if you have a celebrity crush while others have said that being attracted to such people is 100% normal. 

While I agree that finding other people attractive is just a part of being human it becomes concerning if you feel the need to continuesly tell your partner this. Obviously I don’t know how your relationship works so maybe you and your partner have a bond over talking about who you find attractive. However, if you are in a closed relationship with someone I don’t see what the point of telling them that you find someone else attractive is, just keep it to yourself. For example, if you see someone on the street and think they look cute why would you tell your partner about how cute they look? Or if you have a celebrity crush on an attractive celebrity, why won’t you just have that fantasy in your head, what will telling your partner who probably doesn’t compare to that celebrity do? 

There’s nothing they can really do with that information, to me it just seems like a way to try and get a reaction out of someone or to see if they’d get jealous or not. If you don’t get jealous by that stuff that’s great and shows that you are confident in yourself, however, if you do get jealous by this stuff there’s nothing wrong with you for doing so, they should keep their fantasies to themself. 

TL;DR - it’s 100% natural to find other people attractive in a relationship but feeling the need to continuously tell your partner who you find attractive is an asshole move.

Edit- I thought this was unpopular due to the amount of people saying “they won’t meet the celebrity anyways so it doesn’t matter” In [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/htwlkc/its_lowkey_rude_af_to_be_so_blatantly_in_love/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Trying to force someone into Atheism is just as bad as trying to force someone into Christianity.,27301,2765,2018-12-23 05:34:04,"I am one of those Atheists who doesn't care what religion people around me practice. I would honestly rather just let people be. I don't think I am more intelligent or better than people who do religion. I have been seeing several threads on Reddit calling everyone who has done religion ""dumb"", ""detached from reality"", etc. Albert Einstein was a Jew, does being an Atheist automatically make us more intelligent than him? No.

And it also makes me cringe when Atheists try to force religious people into Atheism. If we are going to strongly condemn Christians trying to force others into Christianity, we should condemn Atheists trying to force Atheism on to other people.

If it doesn't affect you, just let people be.

Edit: Thanks for bringing Einstein to my attention, with him being ethnically Jewish, growing up in a Jewish family, but not really believing in it too much himself. That being said, intelligent and accomplished people who are religious, do obviously exist. Isaac Newton, someone who was gifted with math but extremely anti-social, was a devout (un-orthodox) Christian. If you don't want to use scientists as an example, James Madison, who wrote the Bill of Rights that is idolized by many, was also Christian. The conclusion I am making is that being religious doesn't equal stupidity, and atheism doesn't equal intelligence or success.",0

There needs to be a small dick acceptance movement before I even begin to give a shit about Fat acceptance for women.,27027,4702,2018-12-15 19:30:37,"Perhaps this isnt an unpopular opinion, but I'm a bi man who hasn't ever gotten with another man but I talk to gay men a lot.

I don't think many women realize how fucking horrible it is for a man to have a small dick. How emasculating it is to be judged solely on something that you have absolutely no control over. My size isn't great either but I've come to accept it, however, I know many men who simply can't and most women and society at large do **nothing** to support a person with a small dick. 

When I see all the normal shit about fat acceptance or otherwise loving women no matter what size they are, I laugh because they can fucking *change* their size. A man can't. A woman can get larger breasts, a man can't increase his size. Why should I focus my energy on making those who can change their situation or otherwise in the case of fat people **put themselves in the situation to begin with** feel more comfortable about themselves while those who can't do **anything** to help their situation aren't even fucking mentioned in the mainstream until it's convenient.

While it's taboo to shame a woman for their body, small dick jokes seem as if they are completely fair game and the hypocrisy is absolutely disgusting to me.

Edit: as an addendum, I'd like to also take the time to bitch about men with bigger dicks. 

All I can say is fuck most of you. You treat your smaller brothers like shit most of the time. Thinking you're fucking special or you did something to earn your sexual prowess, fuck off. It was luck of the God damn draw you should be getting on your knees and thanking whatever cosmic force responsible for bestowing your prowess unto you. While the rest of the population has to carefully disclose their size to every partner, wondering in the back of their mind if they *truly* don't care. Even though I accept my size (it's about 5 and a half inches) I know I could have it a lot worse and many men do. I still have it in the back of my mind that whoever I'm with isn't actually satisfied with my size like they say they are. I'm glad you fucks don't ever have to deal with that because I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy to be honest. 

**Edit 2: I would like to address some comments and common replies and also give a brief overview of my thoughts thus far.**

I didn't think this was going to blow up like it did. I'm glad it did to be honest because it really put some things in perspective for me. 

Firstly I'd like to address this ludicrous notion that I hate women. I dont know how I can prove to any of you that I dont hate women other than me saying I dont. I may have used harsh words but my words were not to disparage any one group just for existing. My problem was purely with the double standards, with the non-inclusion of men in the mainstream body positive movement. 

I understand and agree that fat acceptance is something we should be concerned about. No one *should* be made to feel horrible about themselves based on their body by other people. My main point was I believe we should be striving for an all inclusive body positive movement that encompasses everyone from burn victims to people with major deformaties, to men and women whom have insecurities. **I never said one couldn't have a fat positive movement.** (despite my disagreements with it due to the unhealthy side effects encouraging obesity can lead to but that's besides the point) I simply *longed for an all inclusive body positive movement* to be pushed just as much if not more than the fat acceptance movement. I get that caring about one thing within a movement doesnt necessarily negate your concern for other issues. But from where I'm sitting it doesnt seem like a lot of men get the same amount of support for their body issues by comparison of women. Perhaps that's just my confirmation bias, and if that's the case I apologize and acknowledge my fault. And before anyone addresses it, I'm not even necessarily advocating for a small dick movement despite the title. That was mostly just for flair and to discuss the notion of body positive movements not including men, and I used penis size as an example. What I really want is inclusivity. Of everyone. 

Another topic I'd like to address is the idea that ""women can't hide the fact that they're fat, men dont broadcast their dick size so it's not as much of a daily struggle by comparison of fat people."" While I understand the logic, I dont really see how its productive. Sexual relationships is a *huge* part of humanity as a whole. Many of us crave it, strive for it. Make it the focus of our daily lives in some cases whether we want to or not. When a person feels inadequate about themselves this can have **major** implications on a persons psyche. If left untreated it can have damaging effects on ones personality and mental state which ultimately harms them on the day to day. I understand that's not a healthy way to go about it, they should be seeking help themselves. But I feel many men are discouraged from talking about it, it's made out to be as if it doesn't matter. Which is why I'm encouraging an all inclusive body positive movement. But I feel the main point those who say this are trying to make is that there's more pressure put on society to accept ones outward appearance that is visible to the naked eye. And I agree with that, but all I'm really saying is we should be reaching higher. 

I obviously can't be the judge of my own character, but I believe I'm a bit of an idealist. For better or worse, I sincerely believe humanity coming together as a whole is not only possible, but necessary for humanity to advance in any meaningful way. Whether it was your intent or not, having a body positive movement that is pushed in the mainstream that is only really geared towards supporting one group can lead to feelings of neglect for another. 

Another topic that was brought up was about my abrasiveness. Many thought I was an asshole in my post and I would agree with that. I admit I'm a bit of a douchebag but that's why I dont want to be the one ""leading the charge"" so to speak. Many suggested that I should start the movement myself, but I'm simply not the right person for the job. I'm hot headed, I sometimes don't think before I speak and many people tend to vehemently disagree with my opinions. I'm a private person, despite how I am online with anonymity, in real life I am a bit of a hermit and have horrible anxiety when placed in uncomfortable positions. I also dont feel it would even be taken seriously given the replies. I see posts of people posting this post on other subs to bitch about it. ""r/unpopularopinion where white men go to whine about shit no one cares about."" I knew there would be opposition to this post and I was prepared for it, but some of the replies honestly make me feel like shit. Perhaps rightly so, because I'm a bit of a dick. But love me or hate me, I stand by most of what I said. 

I sincerely hope that if you take away anything from this, it's that we shouldnt be focusing on advancing one particular group. Supporting one particular group. (Culturally speaking I'm not talking about specific diseases or aggretious physical phenomena) I care about people despite what many of you may believe. And all I really want is peace and acceptance of everybody. (Aside from douchebags who think they're better than everyone else i.e in regards to the first edit about people who flaunt their bigger dicks)

The last major point I'd like to address is many people believe me to be insecure. Somehow me being insecure invalidates the very real lack of support for males in this department. I'll admit that sure, I wish I had a bigger dick. I feel a bit shitty about it at times but for the most part I can tolerate it. I've had partners who didn't care and I genuinely believe them. I know they're out there it's just a matter of finding them. So you can call me an insecure whiny little bitch all you want but you're only proving my point.  

One last thing is I really do appreciate the discussion. There are a lot of points I strongly disagree with that I didn't address here, and there are many ideas I really should think over and reevaluate myself. And I thank  everyone for giving me the opportunity.",0

I don't respect 10 as a number.,26958,2030,2020-09-12 22:14:38,"I dislike it. I wish ill upon it. There is no reason that a number as unremarkable as 10 should be given such a high stature. 


""But 10 is a cool number and is essential for almost everything"" you might say. Absolute bollocks. I can write an essay about how bad 10 is but to keep it relatively short, the only reason 10 is considered special is because we follow the base 10 decimal number system. It has just this one thing going on for it. But guess what, base 10 is a horrendous way to count, there are many superior versions like base 12 and base 6 that are easy to learn and more viable, especially when doing division. Also finger counting is better in base 6, so please don't spread your humans have ten fingers propaganda.


Yes, I know. The metric system and all existing documentation are in base 10. But that's just one of the ways Big Decimal shills are manipulating you. Do you really want to use a bad number system just because ""It has always been like that""? What is this if not Stockholm Syndrome? If you don't want to become a mere statistic it's high time you stand up for yourself.



TL;DR - I loathe how the number 10 is glorified and admired by people.



Edit: Yes I know it is not intuitive to count in other bases, but thats just because you have been accustomed to decimal. Analogous to language, it is hard to pick up a new one.


Also, I am aware the metric system will get destroyed if we change the base. That's not the point. If we had chosen a different base at inception then metric system, math and day to day life would have evolved with it, making that version of counting just as intuitive as decimal.",0

The reason kids spend their days in front of a screen is because you've fucked up all alternative forms of entertainment,26739,2050,2020-09-02 01:21:23,"People often tend to blame the technology itself when complaining about ""kids these days"" spending all their time with their phones, consoles, and so on. But I don't think videogames and Youtube are something like the ultimate form of entertainment. They're great and I love them, sure, but I don't think they're that addictive or ""special"" to get all of a kid's interest by themselves (after all, kids get bored by everything really soon, don't they?)

Let's look at alternative, more ""traditional"" forms of entertainment. I'm only 28 and I can already see how much they've changed. I used to ride my bike all day long since I was 6 or 7 years old, now it's too dangerous for some reason and many kids will only be allowed to do it while the parents are watching. Same for going to the pool or river for a swim. Feel like playing some football? Well, a drop of rain fell two hours ago so no way! Even just for going to the park! There used to be almost no parents there unless their oldest kid was something like 5 years old. Now there are more parents that children! And there's yet another problem. In some areas, there are just no other children around perhaps in dozens of kilometres!

The most drastic example: I used to have play fights with my siblings, cousins, friends and classmates all the time, sometimes even in front of my parents! Sometimes even the parents were cheering!! I'm not saying that's necessarely a good thing, but it's unthinkable only a couple of decades later. And don't even get me started on fighting in the water (which I've probably done like a million times)!

But these are just examples... I have a few reasons to believe I'm right about this ""helicopter-parenting"" being the reason behind kids loving their phones so much:

\- First, in an era of videogames with graphics and playability that we wouldn't even dream of not that long ago, you'd expect things like chess to be almost disappearing. Well, chess is stronger than eve. Whether in my town, my country or my planet, the number of kids playing chess tournaments does not stop to grow.

\- Also, at least in my experience, this trend had started way before things like social media were mainstream. Already by the time I was 12 or so I noticed kids younger than me spent a lot of time watching TV (and I wasn't the only one)

\- And finally, just compare different types of parents, the rules they put, and what their children do. Think of those two annoying bored kids in a family dinner. If parents force them to stay at the table give them a tablet, they'll be on the tablet, but what if they are allowed to leave?

**NOTE:** The points I'm making here are strongly region-dependent and may not apply to your particular country or society. I'll use my own as a reference and if the situation in yours is wildly different, I'd love to hear about that contrast in the comments.

**ANOTHER NOTE**: I wanted the title to say ""we've fucked up"" rather than ""you've"". I was going to copy/paste, rewrite the title and post again but there were already some comments so I'll leave it as it is so you can see that I'm dumb",0

However, mathematics is not about applying specifically what you learn in the class, but more so about applying the problem solving abilities that you develop through solving math problems. You have A,B, and C... now how can you get to D? It’s all about critical thinking. This type of critical thinking is important to develop so that later on in life when you need to think hard about a problem and derive a solution, you’re not completely inexperienced with this type of thinking.

Edit: some of you still don’t get it. “When will I factor polynomials by hand” - YOU WONT. But the process of solving difficult math problems, thinking in new ways, and making this a habit of yours is what will help to increase your critical thinking skills - just something to constantly engage your head in so you don’t spend an entire child hood staring at a screen and growing up to become useless and achieve nothing because you have fucked your brain up from a very apparent underwhelming use of it during its development stage.

Edit 4: I know there are other ways to improve critical thinking skills, but each core subject approaches it through a different avenue. When you’re reading the classics, which people also hate to do in school, you’re taking the time to understand the archaic prose that was used in these books, you are recognizing the characters motivations, you are trying to figure out what emotions they are feeling - all subconsciously. This type of critical thinking is different from the type used in math where it is a more strict use of logical statements to get from point A to point B. Training your brain to do well in each arena is well worth it. 

If you’re a STEM major and you think you’re superior because you can solve fancy math equations or write a cool program... you’re not. So many programmers are totally inadequate at for example describing their vision for a future project, selling their idea, etc. - reading some books would help with that!

"Boomers are, on average, more rude and entitled than teenagers.",26262,1871,2020-03-17 16:16:26,"I say this as someone who's worked in retail and the food service industry for roughly 5 years now. 

This is based on how upset people got on things that weren't my fault. For example: customers not being allowed to use the company's bathroom, not accepting expired coupons, the kitchen messing up their order, not refunding a product they didn't buy at our store, not giving a discount that doesn't apply to them. 

I'm good at my job, I treat every customer with respect, it doesn't happen often that someone throws a shit fit. But when it does, more often than not, it's a boomer.

Edit: Yes, every generation can be rude. I'm not denying that.

Edit 2: I'm not sure why people are assuming this, but I'm not an American, or male.

While those attacks are worth a long in depth civil discussion by itself, if you aren't directly affiliated with the victims, you need to get a grip with yourself and stop making everything about you.

Like you are taking national tragedies, and making it about yourself. If it bothers you that much, get off your ass and speak to your local lawmakers.

It just really annoys the shit out of me. Like I may like guns, BUT at least I respect anyone calling for action against guns. That's action. You're voicing a stance, and that's good. 

You saying ""omg, I'm literally shaking"" is just fucking worthless reaction to tell anyone. 

Get a grip.

Edit: So far I have been DMed and called a ""cunt"" and a ""dumpster faggot""
Very classy. You're mad about me saying anything about these attacks, but you realize the recent Orlando attack was a gay nightclub, right? Is that irony lost on you when calling me a ""faggot""? 

Otherwise, thank you for the mostly civil discussion, even if you really disagree with me. Only a few people grossly misunderstood me. I also do have empathy for innocent people getting slaughtered minding their own business, but I don't have room for people seeking attention over something that has little to do with them.

Someone made a burner account to tell me to die, yet I ""don't have empathy"" and I'm the ""psycho""? The irony is so thick, I could scoop it up and spread it on a peice of bread.

Because of their crusade on GMOs, which would feed millions of people and reduce the amount of farmland we would need exponentially. 

Because their use of bullshit alarmist talking points has become common practice among environmental activists and has caused several people to become apathetic towards a very important issue.

And because they are a bunch of twats whose publicity stunts irreversibly damaged a UNESCO Heritage Site and caused the deaths of millions because of their crusade against DDT.

They personify everything wrong with the environmental movement. They have essentially killed every viable strategy we have to combat our impact on the environment in the eyes of the public and ruined the perception of the movement as a whole. They are the reason we aren't doing jackshit about climate change, because their anti-science activism has ruined the reputation of every technology that could yield the most results.

Edit #1: A slight correction on the DDT point. It was only banned worldwide in 2001, but is still used in small quantities to combat large infestations of mosquitoes. It was also linked to several health defects in humans and animals. However, it doesn't change the fact that malaria kills 3000 children every day and that DDT is still the most effective way to combat it, at least in reasonable doses.

Psuedo-science is much more dangerous than religion in our current timeline.,26173,1771,2020-01-29 04:58:34,"When scientific jargon is adopted by people who use it to push a narrative, it becomes almost indistinguishable from actual science to the general public.

For example, take the idea that an increase in solar output is the main cause of climate change. This is psuedo-science nonsense that has no basis in scientific reality yet to the naked eye, non peer reivewed studies claiming this to be the case can be very convincing. 

I have no idea how lies that use scientific jargon can actually be combated due to just how many people don't have time in their day to fact check what they hear.

For another instance, I know multiple people that became convinced that 1 volcano eruption put more co2 into the atmosphere than all of man made emissions combined just a couple years ago.

That's not even jargon, that's a basic ass meme and it had an effect on people I knew.

So, no matter how low of a self-esteem you have, go buy a nice and ***long smelling*** perfume and maybe that helps. Btw, I don't really think ppl are ugly, no matter how you look, there's still something about you that's attractive and handsome, but if you personally think that you are ugly (trust me I know how that feels), maybe try to boost yourself by being extra picky when it comes to your own hygiene/smell and maybe you will recieve some compliments

You have a moral obligation to fix your mental/physical issues and childhood traumas before you bring children into this world.

Stop having kids to get your SO to stay, or because you're lonely, or because you feel pressured to do so by society. Have them if YOU are READY.

I find acne attractive,25805,1175,2020-03-29 10:00:50,"Ever since I can remember I have found acne attractive. By acne I dont mean just one or two zits, I mean a full face. I dont know why, but I see them the same way I see freckles. Its really adorable to me. I'm attracted to both men and women so this applies to everyone. In the past I have had mini crushes on people and the main thing I found attractive was their acne.

So if you have bad acne, dont worry! There will be people like me who find it very cute.

Edit: Adding some things to answer some of the reoccuring comments :) 
Apparently similar posts have been made on this topic before, I didnt realise this. I dont care for karma and was just talking about this acne topic with my boyfriend recently. He said before I told him that he never really thought about it but after he did he realised he also found it cute. This surprised me as I hadnt heard this from anyone before apart from myself.

I had acne when I was younger and it made me feel really insecure, so I had the idea of posting my opinion here to let people struggling with acne know that theyre beautiful :) 

I do have a bad memory though, so maybe I saw one of these posts in passing and got reminded of it after the conversation with my partner. Either way, I dont really care for karma, so this is not fake. 

Also clarifying that this isnt fetish! I find people with acne attractive, but its not a sexual thing. Like I said, I find acne similar to freckles. I think theyre cute details :) 

I am glad I made some people happy, even if it were only for a moment, so thank you to all those comments :) Your comments made my day too!",0
'Because I don't want to' is a perfectly valid reason for not wanting to do something.,25755,744,2020-09-18 03:45:37,"Sometimes my younger sister will ask me to do something with her, and I just don't feel like it.

Servers/Waitresses rarely deserve 15-20% tips for each table.,25732,4256,2020-10-16 06:08:45,"Let’s see if this sub is actually about unpopular opinions. 

My SO is a waitress at a local diner. She gets her tables that tip well, and some that don’t (or not at all). I see posts on Reddit every single day complaining about people who don’t tip or tip smaller than the regular 15% (or what I’m seeing lately is that “standard tip” trending more towards 20%). I don’t advocate for not tipping your waitress. He/she is providing a service to you: they deserve compensation. But 20%? 

When it’s all said and done, my SO makes more money than I do as a waitress and I work in a very specialized field with several years training. This isn’t me complaining about my salary, cause I do pretty well myself. And don’t get me wrong, when she comes home with $200+ in just tips after a short shift, I’m super happy for her. 

Here’s where my unpopular opinion comes in. No waitress at a regular restaurant should be expecting 20%, even 15% from their tables unless they’re giving us damn back rubs while serving. A 4 person table at a reasonably priced restaurant can run you $70-$100. I don’t feel that they earn their $20 tip (ie 20%) by simply bringing drinks at the beginning, slapping plates on the table, and bringing my bill.

\- The other thing is: I have to admit that this post was rushed. And yes, I am quite inconsiderate in it (for reference see my content below and some of my replies). The funny thing is that while I might think some commenters are oversensitive I have the other end of the spectrum: insensitiveness to some extent and I can also get oversensitive. I don't regret what I wrote (it was a start for a good lesson) but reading through some well thought-out opinions my self-reflection started to operate. Some of you made the assumption that I must not have a lot of experience regarding relationships. That's right. And sometimes I turn into this arrogant person who likes to believe she knows it all (btw I'm female for those who thought otherwise). The reactions are just as harsh as my statement but it's okay. I can understand that what I said can be an effective method in some relationships  (that's great) and cannot be applied in others (which is also valid). And at the end I'm the one who should have stayed more flexible. I should have considered more factors. I want to apologize about that honestly. So thank you all for responding and expressing your viewpoints, now I'll have a lot to think about and a lot to work on. I'm not afraid to face judgement if that's what people feel like giving me based on my content. So thank you for offering the experience. I appreciate both the agreements and disagreements. I'll try and digest them properly in the following days. I'm still think that I'm right about SOME aspects but not anymore do I believe my reasoning is flawless. I wanted everyone who engaged in  this conversation to know that.

**Content:**

Honesty is NOT kindness. Honesty is honesty. Period. I don’t mean you have to be cruel about it but you shouldn’t put honesty aside in favor of toning serious things down. You can be honest and respectful and showing care without being overly soft towards your partner. If you can’t take it well, the problem is you and not the other person. And yes, it is applicable to those who have mental health issues, too.

You can’t just tiptoe around a topic that is basically one of the most essential founding-factors of a (sexual) relationship.

Your partner should be able to freely speak his/her mind (again respectfully and kindly enough which is still not too “soft”) - and how you react to that is YOUR responsibility. The partner doesn’t have to just accept the fact you gained weight just because it’s a sensitive topic to you. I wonder why it’s so sensitive…

Looks does matter. We have a right to voice what we like and by putting away our own ego we should be more flexible dealing with and communicating it.",0

Depending on how baggy they are, they can feel really good around your ankles. I personally prefer swimming in baggy jeans but skinnies work well too. They (the skinny jeans) are also more fun to take off when they’re soaking wet. 

Also, when your jeans are soaked, they’re heavier. It’s always leg day when your jeans are wet.

"90% of beauty standards women feel are enforced by other women, not men",25554,1672,2019-02-09 07:28:29,"It's crazy to me that there's so much talk about toxic masculinity, but toxic femininity is ingrained in our society and no one bats an eye. 

Cosmo, vogue, fashion shows, reality t.v. Who is really perpetuating the unattainable standards for women to be skinny, to have matching outfits, to wear loads of makeup and possess flashy jewelry. Most guys, in my experience, never complain or even notice shit like that. But every woman I have known talks shit behind other girl's backs or to their face. And a lot of these are impressionable, young girls that drive so much toxicity. 

And if we're talking about gender standards, there has been a huge reverse in standards against men in the last decade. If men even desire a woman to be in shape or presentable, there's an uproar of sexism. But most women are able to have a laundry list of expectations for men and it goes unchecked. Its ludicrous.

TL;DR: Women have unnecessary beauty standards placed on them but it has nothing to do with men. This is toxic femininity and it's dangerous. Sorry this was so long.

Edit: Okay obviously I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did so I would like to clarify some things. 

1. This thread was not made to bash women whatsoever. I have no control over the comments made here or if they misconstrued my original point. People who are using this as a platform to ridicule women are doing the exact opposite of having a civil debate.

2. I am simply drawing attention to the fact that we as males are told constantly why we are perpetuating toxic masculinity. But there are huge examples of toxic femininity in our society and this is one of them.

3. People refuting this with facts or having a civil discussion, thank you. Those calling me mysogynistic or saying this post is a circle jerk, I think it's important to look outside your bias and see maybe women have A LOT to work on if they want to strive for a less toxic society. It starts with themselves, calling for women to be held accountable is not mysogynistic.",0
My faith in humanity isn’t restored when I see something like the bullied girl with a disability wins homecoming queen. Call me cynical but it really feels like an ego boost for the people who voted for her. Disabled people and bullied people aren’t your charity case.,25516,1418,2019-10-01 10:32:25,"You see it all over social media and the news, headlines that read, “There are still good people in this world. She was bullied for her disability but her classmates voted her for prom queen.” or “Star basketball players stands up for his bullied classmate”. Sure it seems sweet at first but when I think about it all I can see is someone doing something “nice” for their own personal gain. When these stories make the news, who usually gets the most publicity? Who gets the interviews and good press? Why, the people who did the “good deed” of course. Most of the time it seems like they don’t give a damn about the person who they did something “nice” for, instead it’s about “Look what WE did! WE are so nice! WE are so good hearted!” It’s all about making themselves feel better when they go to sleep at night, it’s almost never about the person it should be about. It’s not sweet and heartwarming, it’s almost sort of heartbreaking because I’ve seen instances where people will do “nice things” for someone because they take pity on the person and it makes them look good in the eyes of others, but go right back to treating that same person like shit as soon as nobody else is paying attention. It was never about being nice and genuine, it was all a big ego boost. If you want to do something nice do it when nobody’s looking and don’t accept any congratulations for your good deed.

ETA: like i said in a reply to a commenter, Sure its a “nice thing to do” and in some cases it makes the disabled person feel good and it’s a nice gesture all around, BUT disabled people aren’t mindless angel pets. They have brains and lots of them don’t like to feel pitied or patronized. Especially when that pity is superficial and the people who give her those pity votes will go right back to ignoring or bullying the disabled person. I’m not saying “Don’t ever be nice because people could misconstrue your motives” I am saying, however, that you should be mindful of your actions and be careful not to make people feel patronized and pitied. Also if you’re gonna do something nice for someone make sure you’re being genuine be consistent with your actions towards someone. Don’t be nice one day and then cruel the next. I know that all good deeds are a little selfish and that’s not my main issue here. The motive isn’t the issue either, it’s the fact that people see others who happen to have a disability as nothing more than a sad little animal to feel sorry for. Instead of mistreating someone, doing one “nice” thing either because you feel sorry for them or you want wholesomeness clout or both, and then going right back to treating that person like shit; you could be genuine in the first place and treat them like any other human being and maybe even develop a true friendship with them. My issue is the publicity and praise people get for being insincere and inconsistent. I really don’t give that much of a shit about “prom queen” or shit like that anyway, I’m using it as an example. I’m almost 20 years old and when I was younger I never ran for those positions anyhow. Another example could be, like people in the comments said, giving a homeless guy $90 and filming it to post on youtube. Instead of patronizing the guy, maybe hire him to help you wash your car or do some yard work and then pay him for his labor. That way he won’t feel pitiful and have such low self esteem.

Not only childless people, but parents that want a break from their own kids shouldn't have to deal with them either. There are ""pet-free"" apartment buildings, and restaurants, and beaches, so why not ""child-free?"" Children can be just as gross, loud, and smelly as a pet.

People have so, SO many fun places to take their kids. Adults deserve more fun places to go where they don't have to be around Karen and her 5 little hellions.

Edit: You all are acting like I'm trying to ban kids from existence lol. Calm yourselves. I'm just saying a couple hundred ""adult-only"" arcades, movie theaters, restaurants, etc would be nice. It's not much to ask especially since there are thousands and thousands of those that are kid friendly. So far ""go to a bar"" is the biggest argument you guys can think of. That's pretty sad. Not everyone likes the bar scene or drinks.

Is worth mentioning that this isn't only about hating on the internet, is also about giving a feedback to awful content makers so they know their shit is boring and can make something about it to improve.

Same goes with tiktok, wich I downloaded for a week and then uninstalled it becasue of people making shit content and me not being able to make them know how bad they are. Also because there are almost none original videos there.

They take a piss, lick themselves clean then lick us. I know that their saliva helps them clean their mouths, but they clean it for themselves, not to make it clean for us. It's like nails on a chalkboard for me when I see pictures of people ~~(mostly women)~~ puckering their lips for their dog to lick them.

My dog has been trained to sniff my face as much as he wants but never lick it. He can lick my hand or arm a couple of times before I discourage him and wash myself off. I don't let him lick my face for the same reason I don't let strangers lick me: I don't know where TF his tongue has been.

At the end of the day, to each their own, it's just not my cup of tea.

EDIT: The number of people comparing being licked in the face by a dog to having sex with another human being is astounding. To be clear, I'm not saying we're pristine, clean creatures.

Oversexualisation is the worst thing we've done as a culture,24892,2661,2020-05-20 17:06:32,"Sex sells. It's a common marketing thing and, guess what? Its successful because its true. But there's now been such an over saturation of sex being used to sell that it's everywhere.

Adverts - those perfume adverts for one. Why the hell does a perfume require two half naked people in bed and the man smelling the pillow as the girl struts off? Another example, in the UK, an advert for being bikini body ready was removed from the Underground for being too sexy. It was on a massive wall on the station platform.

TV - Too Hot to Handle is my bugbear for this one right now. A bunch of sexy adults being told not to have sex for a cash prize and acting like it's the worst thing in the world. Also, reality tv in general has become about sexiness. The Kardashians, for one.

Music - The sheer number of inappropriate music videos is scary, not to mention the performances on stage.

The extent of sexualisation is profound. So much so that I think we as a Western culture have become used to it. I have a friend from Sri Lanka. When he came to the UK, he said that there was so much sexualisation that he was initially overwhelmed and was looking for sex everywhere.

I really hope that in the future, we realise that we've exploited ourselves and our youth. I hope there's time to change.

I'm not a fighter by any means. I'm not trained, qualified, or confident in my ability to fight off someone who is being violent for whatever reason. Me being a man doesn't mean I'm imbued with crazy hulk-strength automatically, much less know how to use it.

In ten years of cleaning for a living, the grossest thing I saw in a men's restroom, was poop stains in the toilet. I worked for a million dollar company, where everyone dressed up. And had money, and the women DESTROYED their bathrooms. Sometimes I wasn't even sure the things I saw, came out of humans.

Secondly, the grossest cars and bedrooms I've been in, were women's. In female friends homes I've seen rotten cheese under the bed, curdled milk on the nightstand. Dirty streaked underwear on the floor, dog shit, used condoms, and more.

I've never seen worse than dirty clothes on a man's bedroom floor.

"The “you’ll never use math and science outside of school” narrative in America is horrible, counter-productive, and for the most part not even true.",24479,1557,2020-07-28 01:02:23,"I mean, has The United States of America ever needed math and science more in its history than right now? Telling students this ingrains, for the rest of their life, complacency and disregard for the world around them. 

Math and science classes don’t always have direct application, no, but calling them useless because of that is a naive oversimplification. These classes teach critical thinking. These classes teach problem solving. These classes teach our students *how* to think about things. 

I understand the benefit in telling a student that is struggling in math class that he/she is not destined to be a failure because of it. But that is totally separate from “bragging” (especially around young people) that you don’t use math in your career (even though you probably do even if you don’t realize it). That is being a bad influence on a very easily influenced population of people. 

Math is money. Science is life. You don’t have to be a rocket scientist for these things to be important. And just because you fix air conditioners or sell cars for a living doesn’t mean you are absolved of them. In fact, that ignorance makes you way more prone to someone who does not share it taking advantage of you in life. 

Tl;dr: “I never use math in my job” and similar school-is-useless narratives are the last thing students need to be hearing, especially right now.

Edit: 

I did not mean to imply that *only* Americans face this problem. I was just speaking on what I know and didn’t want to generalize. 

Also, I feel like most people in the comments are missing the point. I’m not arguing that you do or don’t need the literal skill of math. I’m arguing that you should not give students and young people reason to have distrust in maths and sciences just because you don’t need to know how to graph a line at your day job. I know that the intended message is not harmful but the interpretation of it deeeefinitely can be.

There were better female-empowering shows and movies 20 years ago than there are today.,24394,3305,2019-10-29 16:45:21,"This came up while discussing movies with my sister. I asked if she finds it cool that so many women are now getting important roles in the entertainment industry. She said something like “I’m not sure if they got the roles cuz they’re good AND female or just because of the latter” and it really opened my eyes. 

The current female-centric reboots are mostly flopping (things like Wonder Woman being exceptions). I found Terminator, Power Rangers, Castle, etc. way cooler when they made them EQUALS with men and not simply trash them. Also, wasn’t it more inspiring when women made it big back then? I remember when the chess player Judith Polgar became famous and was right up there with the men. Now, with a separate Chess league for women, nobody really cares about it. But I’m digressing.

Power Rangers vs the new Ghostbusters is my point. Females were part of the original PR team in almost equal numbers. They usually wore pink and such feminine colour but equally kicked butts in battles. That. Was. Awesome. The new Ghostbusters isn’t. 

Now I’m just not sure that if a woman wins an award that was usually male-dominated, was the reason really merit? Twenty-years ago, it surely would have been.

EDIT: To answer so many questions on the existence of separate chess leagues for men and women, yes, I’m not making this up.

But at some point, we decided that they were gods gift to earth and whenever we saw them in a park or on the side of the road, you should just run away and leave it alone. Fuck. That. I wanna power bomb that bastard so hard that he'll feel like he got T-Boned by an aircraft carrier. If anything, I'm helping the rest of these shitbrained bendy straw neck ass birds to fear humans so they wont catch any more hands


TL;DR: Fuck geese, it should be socially acceptable to remind it where it lies on the food chain

"Men don't enjoy the ""romance"" genre because it doesn't look at all like romance to us. It looks like WORK.",24266,2590,2020-08-05 21:33:49,"I have a friend who is baffled why men don't enjoy movies or books in the ""romance"" genre. She says it's because men are often too insecure in themselves to feel like they can enjoy that sort of thing. 



In my opinion, it's a lot more simple and upsetting. Where women look at romance novels and see love and caring, men look at them and see *work*. 



To be fair, sometimes these movies and novels hide it pretty well. Maybe it starts with a happenstance encounter, a ""meet cute."" The relationship will progress - sometimes it will look like it's by accident. Loving glances are exchanged. Meaningful gestures of affection are performed. Eventually things reach a head and the characters begin ravishing each other, unable to keep their affection hidden any longer. 



What most women will see is a guy who is empathetic and open and aboundingly loving. 



What most men will see is a horrifying amount of work and luck. These novels and movies often treat the man as an almost omniscient entity. He does everything *perfectly* and knows *exactly* how to make someone swoon. He is expected to have boundless confidence (work), to continually push the relationship forward (work), to make gestures of affection (work), and to not want or need any affection in return (work). 


Basically, romance is *work* and a lot of people have been sold the idea that it's simply a natural thing you do if you love your partner. It's only partially true - you do it because you love your partner, but it's work nonetheless.



But there's absolutely a reason I don't like romance movies - it's not because they are feelsy or goofy or anything. It's because when I look at them I know I'm expected to feel loved by making someone else feel loved, and that doesn't really feel like romance to me.


Edit: this is about UNEQUAL work. So many times the guy goes incredibly far out of his way to ""woo"" the girl, but the guy never is ""wooed"" back. It's often treated like the woman continuing to say yes and allowing herself to be wooed is an equal amount of reciprocation, and I feel as if it's not. Good relationships are about mutual affection and ideally it SHOULDN'T feel like work. But it's easy for affection to turn into work if it's unfairly distributed or never reciprocated - because romantic gestures require *effort* even if they aren't ""work"". 


Edit 2: to all the comments that suggest these movies show men ""actually putting in the effort most women do in their relationships"", I would advise you to take a load off in your next relationship and hold yourself to the standards these movies portray men.


Last edit: God, the amount of people in the comments that are losing their minds at a man daring to desire to be romanced is truly saddening.",0
You Don't Deserve Medical Treatment if You Don't Intend to Stop Doing the Thing That's Killing You,24240,2561,2019-04-06 17:07:48,"I'll preface this by just saying I work for a hospital so I'll keep it simple by giving an example; 

Guy smokes a pack a day religiously. Guy gets lung cancer. Guy has chemo and ends up having a lung removed. Guy **continues** to smoke a pack a day with no intention of stopping. I've also seen this in people who have chronic breathing issues because they smoked for many years. They bitch and moan that they can't breath, go to the hospital and use up oxygen tanks and everything else all while refusing to stop doing the thing that is killing them.

The letter Q is unneeded and has no reason to be in the English alphabet,24139,2978,2020-02-04 16:34:04,"Okay, let me try this again. The last time I tried posting this, it posted 14 times.

The letter ""q"" could be replaced by the letter ""k"" and it would have no effect. ""Q"" is always followed by the letter ""u"" to make the ""kw"" sound. So why include it at all?

Queen becomes Kween

Question becomes Kwestion

Equation becomes Ekwation

..And so on. If the letter ""Q"" didn't exist, there would be 25 letters in the alphabet, which is a much more standard number (multiple of 5, easier to remember, etc).

Beaches are fuckin shite,24101,1881,2019-04-23 20:00:36,"Right, so you got to the beach, where it's really hot and there's sand everywhere.

Gun safety safety training should be a mandatory class in high school,24069,3984,2020-09-16 22:52:34,"The justification for Sex Education is that ignorance is more dangerous than knowledge. The same holds true for firearms. Far too many people are shot with ""unloaded"" guns. Ignorance of what guns are and how they work is more dangerous than people knowing what they are, what they can do, and how to safely handle them.

EDIT:

1. Even if you believe that guns should be banned, the legal process for accomplishing this in the US would take decades. It's extremely difficult to alter our constitution, there's considerable opposition to changing it, and the political reality it that it is easier to leave the constitution the way it is than it is to change it. Consequently, even if you want to ban all guns, it still makes sense to teach kids to safely handle them as an interim solution.
2. Teaching kids how to safely handle firearms will not help them shoot up a school. Someone who has never handled one before can figure out how to fire it within a few minutes, especially with movies, computer games, and Google as a guide. Firearms are designed to be as easy to use as possible. Using them destructively is extremely easy. Consequently, handling them safely is harder than using them destructively and requires training.
3. You don't need to bring guns into schools to teach kids how to safely handle them for the same reason you don't need to have sex in the classroom to teach kids how to use a condom.
4. For those who aren't from the US: To understand why the US is ""obsessed"" with guns, you have to understand US history. The US was founded by rebels who were rebelling against a tyrannical  government and they wanted to retain the ability to rebel against their  new government should it also become tyrannical. This is as true today as it was the day it was written. A reasonable argument can be made that  the second amendment protects weapons which are necessary for  overthrowing our own government, should it become tyrannical. It's a  healthy thing for our politicians to be a little afraid of us.
5. Requiring gun safety training, background checks, and licenses at the point of sale simply doesn't work. There are a plethora of ways that your child can encounter a gun without purchasing one. For example, I very vividly remember climbing into my parent's attic  through the ceiling of an unfinished bathroom(which I'm certain they  didn't think I could do) and showing my friends, without the knowledge of their parents, one of my dad's rifles for no other reason than because I thought it was really cool. No one died but someone easily could have. I had no fucking idea what I was doing. There is simply no way that any law or  requirement at the point of sale can prevent scenarios like that from happening.
6. Teaching kids to shoot guns isn't the point. The point is to teach kids how to avoid firing a gun by accident if they encounter one.
7. Not everyone will own a gun and not everyone will encounter a gun during their life. However, the problem is that we don't know which kids will encounter guns and which won't. Therefore, the only way to teach gun safety to the kids who need it is to teach it to all of them.",0

Hollywood seems to be obsessed with making movies that were successful. I believe it's in an attempt to exploit nostalgia and make a half assed remake for a quick cash grab. It may work in some cases but nostalgia does not substitute good writing and acting.

A failed remake of an unsuccessful movie will most probably go unnoticed but a failed remake of a age old classic is going to be more disappointing to the fans and everyone is probably going to end up hating everyone involved with the movie (I'm looking at you Ghostbusters 2016).",0

I genuinely don't understand how anyone likes 6ix9ine and the fact that they do makes me lose faith in society.,23909,1774,2020-06-22 03:05:48,"6ix9ine is absolutely disgusting in the things he was convicted of and got away with, and I just don't think he deserves an ounce of popularity now that he's gotten away from all that. He confessed to recording and distributing a video of a man having sex with a 13-year-old girl and yet... he is literally one of the most prominent artists of 2020 so far?

A lot of the people who like him are millennials and zoomers, who I believed to be progressive enough to shut this type of shit down, yet here we are. This guy is out here topping the charts and everything he says and does is absolutely blown up and near impossible to ignore if you're someone who tries to stay to date with the newest music and media.

I genuinely don't understand it, and I'm disgusted by it. I also just don't get how he has a likeable appearance either if we're going to the more shallow part of my opinion. He's fucking ugly and has purposely destroyed his physical appearance and looks like he hasn't bathed in weeks. He is always getting in trouble and flaming other people and he is just everything a person shouldn't be, and yet he is at the top of the game and unfortunately succeeding.

I personally believe he deserves the opposite of everything he's gained in these past few months. I also no longer like anyone who decides to work with him. It's one thing to separate the art from the artist but to boast the artist by openly & proudly working with the artist (looking at Nicki) makes you seem like you have no problem with working with that sick asshole.

**EDIT:** Thanks for the Gold! I never had it before and I really really appreciate it! Also I really have enjoyed reading everyones thoughts on him. Makes me feel like I'm less crazy and moreso it's just he has high numbers because people like the hype music more than they do him... but it still messes with me a bit that there's a little girl out there that has to see him all over the charts after what he did partook in doing to her. That's all I care about, not the people he snitched out (they probably had it coming if they had shit that needed to be snitched about to begin with). It just saddens me to think about her. 

I feel the same way for all other screwed up celebrities who's crimes went under the radar and they were never properly held accountable and still were able to thrive, I just have never seen a guy straight up *make* CP and then get a slap on the wrist and become more famous than he was before, it's bizzare.

American Colleges shouldn't force you to take classes irrelevant to your career path.,23875,4172,2019-09-23 07:46:12,"According to my understanding, most of the world doesnt require you to have an undergraduate degree to go into medical school, with their medical school just being 6 years long. In america, to become be in a medical career, you need 8 years of school vs the 6 years at other countries. 


In those 8 years of school, I must take philosophy, sociology, and speech to get an undergraduate in biology. There are *some* classes you can wriggle an argument for, like physics 1 or writing, but probably not physics 2 or speech.



Saying ""colleges just want to make you well rounded"" makes you sound like (and I hate using this term) a sheep. To my understanding, American colleges were more identical to the rest of the world's some time ago. (Not 100% sure on that) So, by saying that colleges want to make you more well-rounded is like saying previous generations of STEM field grads weren't (*or even grads from other countries that is*).  Taking philosophy for 1 semester isn't going to turn my life upside down, not 90°, not 45°, not even 1°.


Edit: ok, I understand and agree that philosophy is important. However, learning that other countries do not require 8 years of education to be in a medical field, makes me irritated at my beloved country. I just used philosophy as pet peeve to get a point across. 1 semester of a particular liberal art feels more like an excuse to siphon money, especially if it is considered vital for an undergraduate that is completely irrelevant. Hell, my school has bio ethics, I haven't taken it yet but that seems like a lovely way to possibly blend philosophy and biology, keeping it relevant. 
 

It honestly feels like colleges just want our money, at the expense of the student's lives. Allowing students 2 more years in their 20s (ideally) and less debt to deal with, can save them so many more problems.",0

Another irritating thing, is that women tend to stick to the same topics, it’s like they’re so brainwashed with their priorities, the narrative that your worth is based on your appearance seems to be growing with the age of Instagram, which tends to be dominated by half naked women constantly seeking validation by how many likes they get.

The majority of offended people will fake emotional outrage in order to terminate any civil discussion,23813,2046,2020-07-29 18:29:19,"In my anecdotal observation, many people who quickly escalate their outrage have done so to manipulate the core of discussion from one that revolves around facts and data to one that focuses solely on feelings and perceived virtue through victimhood. They perceive their outrage to be virtuous, and that the more outraged they are about said topic, the more virtue they hold over you. The argument quickly becomes less about the topic and more about you as an opponent.

Masking disingenuous motives under the guise of righteousness is what makes this behaviour particularly reprehensible. Two human beings should be able to have a civil disagreement on anything - even if one the persons views are seemingly ridiculous, (Earth being flat, etc). To be open minded you must try to understand _why_ they believe what they believe and maybe stand a chance of educating them, or at least coming out of the conversation better understanding the root cause of their misguided beliefs. Maybe I’m too much of an optimist.

EDIT: To clarify, this is obviously a generalisation and doesn’t apply to all cases. It also does not appeal to the idea that someone who is outraged is wrong and someone who isn’t is right. I could have the patience of a saint and still be wrong (and I often am).

"If your dog has cancer and you opt for chemo, you're a bad person.",23567,2475,2019-07-27 13:45:22,"An old dog lives to be 15. They are also the most loyal and perfect friend could ever possibly hope for. We truly are not good enough for dogs. On the grand scale of intelligence in this world, they are also complete and total idiots. They don't understand medicine. They don't understand that you are trying to extend their life. 

All they know is that on a regular basis the most important person in their life, their owner, is taking them to a strange, smelly, terrifying torture arena. They are stabbed, poked, prodded and their veins are filled with poison. The next thing they know they have gone from terrified to nauseated, fatigued and just feeling like absolute shit. And you, their human, are doing it for what? To squeeze out a tortured 1 - 5 more years?

They don't understand and they can't consent. Let your beautiful friend enjoy the last few months in peace and then send them off surrounded by their family. You're not trying to save your dog, you're being cruel because you don't want to let go.

EDIT TIME!! Everything above this is the same as when I originally posted it. Below is my addendum. 

So, it has come to my attention that I was pretty misinformed on how pets react to chemo and the purpose of it. Thanks to those of you who were willing to explain without your pitchfork and torch at the ready. [For more information on pets and chemo I went to this site, seems reliable](https://wvrc.com/veterinary-specialties/veterinary-oncology-wi/chemotherapy-general-information/). 

In keeping with the spirit of this sub I'd be willing to alter my unpopular opinion to instead state, ""If your dog has ~~cancer and you opt for chemo~~ *a serious health condition and you opt for expensive treatment*, you're a bad person.""

I know how hard it is so say goodbye to your pet. The reason I think you're a bad person is because you're willing to pay exorbitant medical expenses to extend an animal's life because you don't want to say goodbye, ESPECIALLY in instances when the animal is suffering.

In closing, I get it. Putting your pet down is a VERY personal decision, but I still get to think you're a bad person if I think your reasons are shitty.",0
"Giving your kid a super weird name is bad, but it's nowhere near as bad as giving them a regular name like ""Jessica"" or ""James"" but trying to give it a unique pronunciation.",23563,1888,2020-10-07 08:09:00,"I really *hate* when people do this. Recently, I watched a documentary and one of the guys in it was named ""Tristan"" but he pronounced it ""Tri-*stAHn.""* Like, why make your kid go through that?

Sure, we all know some parents torture their kids and give them names like Thaddeus or Light Bulb or other weird shit, but I think it's infinitely worse to give your kid a common name but then try to make the pronunciation unique. Like ""Hi, this is my daughter Jessica, but it's pronounced ""Jeh-ZEE-kah. And this is my son Steve, but it's pronounced ""*Steh*\-vay""

Why do people do this? I'd much rather have a name like ""Wizard III"" than be named James (pronounced ""Hah-mez"") or some shit and have to live my life constantly correcting people.

EDIT: I realize that my examples weren't the best, as some names obviously have different pronunciations in other languages. Like ""Benjamin"" in English versus ""Benjamin"" (pronounced like Ben-hah-meen"" in Spanish. I'm talking about the names where it's clear that the parents gave their kid a weird pronunciation for the hell of it lol. ",0

Now, when I go to the cinema there will typically only be superhero films, and about 10 animated kids films. Good films are still released, but are overshadowed by flying ant-men.

I’m all for sexual health, awareness, and positivity... but there’s a fine line between spreading acceptance and just using sex as a shock factor for attention.

Not saying you should hide your sexuality... you should be free to tell people how you identify. But don’t build your entire worth, personality, and existence around sexual preferences.

We all have certain things that we prefer in the bedroom. You’re not a prude if you don’t publicly broadcast your sexuality or kinks... it just means that you value and respect your sexual identity enough to keep it private.

IMO - It’s really no one else’s business at the end of the day except for me and my partner.



EDIT: I’m not sure why people in the comments are so adamant about forcing the conversation towards the LGBTQ or gay community.... Nowhere in my post did I directly target those communities.

GMO’s are not bad and are not unhealthy.,23313,2860,2020-10-10 21:03:35,"This isn’t really an opinion but everyone seems to think so. I’m under the impression that people don’t even know what genetically modified even means and everyone is falling for propaganda that companies are using to mark up their products. 

Genetically modified crops, most of the time, are crops that have been through artificial selection. That means we noticed a couple of plants that we were growing produced bigger fruit with less seeds or they are less likely to die from weather or from pests or etc, so bred them with each other to create the plant that we enjoy today. This is something that happens naturally through evolution and natural selection as well. There’s nothing crazy or unhealthy about it. It doesn’t change the fruit or vegetables nutrition very much and it certainly doesn’t make it less healthy. 

Another way we genetically modify, which is less likely, is that we give the plant DNA that does all the things artificial selection does like pest resistance, longer growing season, bigger fruit, etc. except it takes a way shorter time. it is actually very helpful environmentally because it reduces the use pesticides. There arent any adverse health effects- it’s still just a fruit or vegetable. There are positive environmental effects. 

Another big point is that there are only something like 10 crops that are genetically modified and sold in America. So when something says “non GMO” it never would’ve had GMOs anyway. It doesn’t make it healthier. I got a chocolate bar that said “non GMO” and I was like ???? This is totally just a marketing scheme.

Instagram is ruining everything (a rant),23244,2124,2019-04-24 17:43:17,"I think that Instagram is one of the worst developments in modern culture. Let me explain:

1. **IG is the most shallow of all social media platforms**. While social media platforms like twitter and sometimes even Facebook politically engage people, allow them to connect and organise Instagram is solely based on one person and their looks/life/vacation. No political or important dialogue is happening. I would argue that even Pinterest is more worthwile since at least DIYs teach you something.
2. **IG is all fake but everyone pretends that it's real.** Why we are all pretty much aware from our own Instagram use that these images are usually not what our lives look like all instagram users apparently have this pact that they are just all going to believe each other's bullshit.
3. **IG is bad for your mental health.** Because unrealistic standards are set on Instagram but everyone just pretends like they're real people doing real things it feels like everybody's life is the way it looks in IG. This also creates feelings of inadequacy and is therefore detrimental to especially young people's mental health. (See also this article: [http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/](http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/)). I also think this applies equally to women and men since the unrealistic standards concerning looks and lifestyle are more than ever directed towards both genders while they previously were more directed towards women as in e.g. advertising.  Additionally, the dopamine rush people get from likes creates an almost addiction-like potential that makes them use the app more and more and making the mental health issues even more pronounced.
4. **IG makes people vain.** Taking pictures of yourself all day makes you the center of your own attention and that leads to ignoring other people and the actual experience you're documenting. It's not about where you went what you ate or what incredible experience you had but only what it looked like and what you looked like doing it. This makes everybody focus more and more on their own appearance and less about things that actually make you a successful human being.
5. **IG gives the worst incentives to people.** The reason I am ranting right now is that I saw a Vice video about a poppy field in California that is killed by people sitting and stepping on it to take pictures predominantly for Instagram (Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxUrr-CIgkA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxUrr-CIgkA)). They then talked to the people taking the pictures asking them why they're doing it and their answers made me incredibly angry. Some people were open about just wanting likes but some others pretended like they were really concerned about the flowers talking about ""the feeling of being one with nature"". So these people want to signal to others that they love nature and the beauty of it while literally destroying the natural habitat and the flowers. This shows that they really don't care about anything at all except their likes on a goddamn picture. Now I don't think that they are inherently bad people but I think that Instagram actively gives them an incentive to be this way fuelled by the addictive potential of the platform and the likes you get from it.

I would encourage anyone reading this to please examine how much time you spend on Instagram and if you get anything from it than a simple dopamine rush and feelings of inadequacy and think of what you could do that's more meaningful and actually makes you happy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT: A lot of people are posting that they follow artists, architects, blacksmiths etc. and use Instagram predominantly in a small community or niche. So just to clarify, I do think that one can use Instagram positively and get a lot of good content from it. What I wanted to point out in my post is the culture that evolved around instagram and especially individual people posting nothing but their lives. And while some of you are so blessed as to not experience this culture in your everyday lives I feel like for others the posting ""cute"" pictures of oneself is a crucial part of social life e.g. kids in middle/high school. I do think that every social media platform can be great since it really depends on the users and what they post. However, I feel that while some good Instagram accounts exist the majority is selfies, vacation and food pictures and that this makes some people feel that they to share this much of their lives as well.",0

I cannot stand messages of hope coming from celebrities.

However, judging by the positive responses to celebrities on social mediaI, I think this is unpopular.  

I consider myself an empathetic and compassionate person, but I don’t think I’ve ever abhorred messages of hope coming from celebrities so much.  I feel like I’m being talked down to, almost like I’m a toddler and they’re adults saying “stay inside, we need each other, we’ll be ok”.   It is SO easy for them to say things like that while they’re still making money from royalties and endorsements.

I have no problem with artists/performers playing their music for us, but for fucks sake just don’t tell us how to feel better.  Also, what’s really grinding my gears are all the people sharing celebrity messages/videos on social media. My sisters and my mom are constantly sending group texts with links to messages of hope from emotional celebrities.  Listen, I love Tom Hanks.  Castaway.... fucking Castaway!!! Love that movie.  But if someone sent me a video of Tom Hanks trying to lift our spirits with words of encouragement, I think I’d rather shart to have a problem I had to deal with immediately.

A child, especially one too young to really understand what's going on shouldn't be exposed to this stuff, and when there's glass and bricks flying, fires being lit, etc it's way too dangerous for them anyways.

When someone near you and your kid start acting up and the police start throwing teargas or pepper spraying people and your kid gets caught in the middle of it or your kid gets kit or hurt by some demonstrator throwing something or lighting off fireworks, it's not the cops fault and it's not the protesters fault.

It doesn't make you any less worthy if you aren't constantly trying to hit some goal.


Edit because my sleepy brain last night wasn't super clear on phrasing: What I'm trying to say here is that small goals are no less important than the big goals that society likes to focus on. I personally (pre-covid) found a costuming job that I love, and have no desire to rise in the ranks because I'd no longer be doing the parts of the work I love most. But I constantly had people saying things like ""when you're a famous designer"" to me - they don't understand that I tried design and hated it because the stress was way more than the reward. It was awful for my mental health. Just taking care of your mental health is a worthy goal, but people act like you have to constantly be striving for bigger things in order to have any worth in society.

Edit 2: I love that there are people telling me that I'll never get wealthy or famous or have success in life with this attitude. Good job failing at reading comprehension; not all of us care about ""making it"" the way society thinks we should. I'm perfectly happy just making my own little corner of the world a better place by trying to be a decent human being.",0

Edit: I could just take this post down but I feel I should explain.

people shouldn't get offended when you tell them you dont wants kids at your wedding,23046,1678,2020-05-02 21:28:25,"(if this is not as unpopular as i think delete it plz) but seriously ppl.

I don't really care how ""quiet and  polite"" your kids are or how you'll keep him out of the way. I love kids, I want kids , but at a party I paid thousands for it to be perfect( not as in looks, i mean as in the atmosphere and the stress level) for me and my spouse? No thanks. Respect them, if people say no exceptions when they tell you no kids at their wedding, respect that!

Don't ask, don't say that's rude, no backhanded compliments. As long as they gave you time to plan for a sitter, it shouldn't be seen as a bad thing. Don't try and make ppl feel bad about it. And do not try to sneak your kids in by bringing them on the day. Personally I wont let you in( gosh that sounds mean) but if they do let you in, you're going to look TERRIBLE, and bratty.

extra:

no i do not hate kids, i love them but you just dont bring them to places that are not kid friendly.

With me, its just a behavior issue so teens (13 and up) are fine. They have manners and know when to be quiet and what is appropriate.

No its not about getting drunk (someone mentioned drugs? wtf) It is about people being able to relax and have fun without worrying that little Timmy is gonna grab a butter knife or that 3 year old Amy is gonna get on the table or run into a waiter.

If Someone says no kids and you have a long time to get a sitter but just dont want to go due to this...that should be fine with you. it aint that big a deal, celebrate another time:)

My view of what a wedding is about may be different than yours..thats fine. I dont judge you for having kids there, your choice man, all i ask is that you dont get angry when i say no kids. imma be sad you can't go but im not gonna hate you over it and i hope it is vice versa.

No i am not asking for gifts at my wedding. I want to specify that.

Confidence is accepting that you are not good looking not convincing yourself you are,22981,1100,2020-03-08 19:26:13,"Just watched a random youtube video featuring every one being asked to rate their own physical appearance and was surprised to see so many below average or borderline ugly looking people rating themselves 10.

So I scroll through the comment section and I see every one praising them for it because ""if you feel like a 10,you are a 10""...like what?

So I can just go to a Hollywood acting agent or modeling agency and just say ""I say I'm a 10 therefore I am so cast me next to Brad Pitt in your next movie even though I am an average looking guy realistically""

It is bullshit and illustrates the problem many people have and everyone propagating it and that is that you can't be confident if you are ugly or better put consider yourself ugly.
Confidence is accepting your flaws and seeing your values in spite of your flaws not covering them up with your delusions.

Saying you are a 10 ( perfect,flawless, best model on the planet ) looking person when you are all but that is the opposite of what you should do if you are searching for true confidence.

Accept your appearance realistically without downplaying or deluding yourself and DON'T EQUATE LOOKS with confidence.

“You know why I want this job...because I need to feed my family and health insurance...” This is why anyone gets a job, so why ask the question?

Showering at night is superior to showering in the morning,22724,1617,2020-06-15 10:34:46,"Hear me out. If you shower in the morning, then go out and walk around, or sit down for a long period of time, or do anything really, you sweat or accumulate germs. If you've previously showered and gotten clean, that cleanliness you've achieved will be no more once you start your day because of this. Why waste a shower? If you shower at night your cleaning off all the crap from the day. Plus, if you wanna get busy with your SO you'll be freshly clean for that where as if you showered in the morning theres a possibility that by the time night time comes around you'll smell like a sewer down there. Nobody wants that, do we? So, just eliminate that possibility by showering at night, or right before that all goes down in other words.

"Having the ability to understand multiple sides of an argument is simultaneously the best and worst thing, which I would not want to give up.",22597,946,2020-08-28 18:03:00,"Hear me out guys, anything happens, there's usually coverage over it from very different sides, I'm talking media coverage (if the event is significant enough), conversation between colleagues, discussion between friends, there's always a few people on one side and a few on another. But I usually, in most cases, find myself in between the arguments and taking best points of both the arguments and merging them while addressing the flaws in both sides' argument. 

While looking at this, it may sound like the best thing ever, to be able to evaluate any argument based on its merit, and it is, but it also is sometimes the worst. Worst as in, there will be people who are so fanatically invested in their side's argument that anyone pointing out any flaw in that argument is abused, and criticized relentlessly, and I cannot push back in the same way with the arguments that their opposing group provides because I know that the opposing group's argument isn't also good enough, then lo and behold, I'm criticised by both the parties, without almost anyone understanding what I meant to say.

So, yeah, this has been my rant, and I know it is a long one, but it can be sometimes tiring to be able to evaluate a situation/argument solely on its merits when fanatically supporting, sounds and is very easy. But that said, I would never want to trade it for anything. 

PS: I do not mean to sound boastful or arrogant, it's just what I have observed, and yeah not everyone is like that, but the number people willing to accept that their argument can be flawed is low.

Edit: Guys I may not be able to reply to you all, but thanks a lot to everyone for your comments, and the people that gave awards, thanks a lot. I did not try to come off as arrogant that I'm smart and people are dumb, so if I gave that impression, please know that that wasn't my intention.",0

I like it when girls hit on my boyfriend,22523,1242,2020-05-01 06:43:08,"No, I don't have some cucking fetish. Here's my reasoning:

I think often in relationships, partners really hate when their SO gets hit on. But as long as you trust your SO, what's the problem?

Sometimes my bf and I will go to the mall, and I'll notice someone checking him out. I really hope he sees. Sometimes he'll go to the gym and a girl flirts a bit. Cool. I'm happy my SO is getting a confidence boost from someone other than me, and I think it's healthy.

IMO friends don't compliment friends enough, and even though you know your SO is being genuine when they compliment you, honestly it loses value. To know a stranger thinks you're attractive or have a good trait is a good feeling for everyone and I know my bf can sometimes have small self-image issues.

Fat women should stop calling themselves curvy or thick,22463,2950,2018-11-01 12:49:00,"I'm SO sick of overweight/obese women in the 'body rights'/HAES movement referring to themselves as curvy or thick instead of fat.

I work out, I eat healthy, I have learned to control my urges and I take pride in taking care of my body. It irks me that these overweight women just go around calling themselves curvy when it should be used to describe women with a somewhat healthy body and larger boobs and ass.  Because of this, I find myself wondering what a guy really means when he tells me I'm curvy or thick. FFS, you're fat! If you're so proud of the glutton you are then you should have no problem in calling yourself fat. Rant over. 

EDIT: for all these kind commenters that keep asking me why I care, it's because being comfortable with obesity as a community will only lead to an even higher economic strain, and a generally unhealthy society. Fat is fat. Not curvy, just fat. There are already media 'personalities' that endorse being comfortable with their bodies (look up glitterandlazers on YouTube, she's the kind of woman my post is addressing). I simply don't think it's the best outlook and if you're so happy with your body you shouldn't have to use blanket terms like curvy. Thanks to you, now the word has negative connotations.

Men not watching porn or masturbating should be normalized on the internet.,22398,2134,2020-09-29 18:51:53,"#FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLEASE READ THE EDITS

Same with Instagram and Twitter. Like alright, cool, guys like to wank one out and stuff, but people should realize that maybe watching stuff like that isn’t enjoyable for all. Im just saying, theres a good number of guys out there who don’t find interest in any of those (including me, but I have a different reason).

We must train ourselves to apologize to children as much as they are taught to not talk back to adults.,22391,416,2020-06-27 19:49:19,"It's seems unfair to me that children don't get the apology that they deserve from us when we hurt them with our words, judge them, especially when we hurt them accidentally. They are constantly taught to say sorry for being disrespectful to grown ups and for doing something that isn't right but we ourselves are not aware of how much pain we inflict to them by not saying sorry when we hurt them a little too much. Yes, adults are always expected to be right but that doesn't make their mistakes invisible to children.

Edit 3: I didn’t think this would blow up, thank you guys! I want to point out again that this isn’t just about genitals. Yes it’s in the title but body shaming can be attributed to height, acne, baldness (that’s to whoever brought this to my attention), body hair, etc. We have to learn to love ourselves and be unbothered but the basis of these societal expectations make it difficult for younger people to gain confidence and could struggle more than necessary into adulthood.",0

The reason men are 'funnier' on average is because humor is one of the few socially acceptable ways for us to deal with our mental health problems,22284,1864,2019-11-28 22:21:32,"The reason there are more male comedians, and they seem ""better"" most of the time is because generations men have been told that what happens to them, and how they feel, is unimportant and even weak. 

More men gravitate towards self-deprecation and humor because it is one of the few socially acceptable ways for us to cope with our mental health issues. 

Men aren't given the same nurturing or support as women, and so we look to different means of processing what we are going through, or have gone through. It isn't about toughing it out, or manning up, or even being immature--it is about a centuries-long system of us not being emotionally important, often even to our loved ones.

What some people fail to understand is that you do not suddenly become a human being when you turn 13. Constantly talking about how gross/disgusting/annoying/etc you think kids are is honestly just rude and in my opinion, makes you a dick. Even if you’re not saying it to their face, even if they’re too young to even understand you — you’re just an asshole. 

Also, not trying to force people to have conversations with young children, but if you talk to some of them, like, genuinely have a conversation, a lot of very young children have valuable opinions on things. They have personalities, wants, needs, likes and dislikes, etc. They are human beings, not just carbon copies of objects meant to make your life miserable. And just like adults, you may get along with some while not get along with others.

I’m just honestly sick of people treating little kids like they aren’t people yet, like they’re less deserving of the same respect you would give to an adult. It’s so douchey and automatically makes me want to stay 3000 miles away from you.


Edit: Okay I need to clarify some stuff. I’m usually just a lurker on reddit, I’m not used to all this attention and I’m not completely sure how to deal with it.

Acne can actually make a person more attractive.,22180,3248,2019-07-20 17:27:35,"I have always thought that if you had acne it automatically makes you unattractive.

Painful cystic acne is a unfortunate ordeal and the person who has it should seek treatment for it.

Alcohol is the worst drug our world has today,22146,2310,2019-12-15 14:49:44,"The social norm of alcohol is fairly sickening. The idea of fun like holidays or vacation or parties or birthdays is usually tied to drinking and alcohol dependency is crippling families across the world on a scale that no other drug competes with. Puking, drunk driving, loud obnoxious behavior, sexual harassment and down right embarrassing behavior is a normality that couples drinking.

Edit: People saying “Heroin is worse/coke is worse” I’ve seen addiction in all shapes and sizes between first hand witnessing heroin overdoses to living with a cocaine/crack addict to having a best friend addicted to meth, not a single one of those drugs is as widespread, popular and accessible as alcohol is nor are they socially acceptable. As a society as a whole no other drugs come close to the damage alcohol has caused. That’s a fact. Though I guess it wouldn’t be an unpopular opinion if people weren’t disagreeing with me.

Edit: To every alcoholic commenting about their hardships with drinking and overcoming them remember that you are not you when you drink and that being able to address that you in fact have a drinking problem is a giant step in the right direction to recovery! As someone who battled with addiction themselves I support each and every one of you in hopes that you make your goal a reality. Your loved ones will appreciate the time they can share with you sober more than any other gift you could give them this holiday season.

"Instead of making divorce easier, getting married should be made harder.",22072,1995,2019-07-31 08:10:30,It’s disgusting that people treat an age old tradition as simple milestone in their disastrous lives.  Marriage is meant to be the everlasting and unbreaking bond between two people. It has been extended to societal and legal roles in the world which is not a problem. The problem is when people treat marriages as their casual relationships. Getting married into a situation they know is unstable or doing it for stupid reasons or impulse. Further problems come with divorce with the management of assets and children. None of this would have been a problem had they not been marked and there were obstacles to them completing it. These obstacles should mean that only people with a true intention to remain with their partner can be married.,0

If you make your husband/boyfriend sleep on the couch because you’re pissed at them (and you share the same bed) I’m gonna assume you’re a bitch,21879,1221,2019-02-26 08:38:54,"Short of them cheating on you or something similar that is a huge breach of your relationship, no one has the right to force someone else out of their own bed.

Your partner’s masturbation habits are none of your business (with four exceptions),21850,1388,2020-09-03 04:14:19,"Advice-Reddit is filled with people being up in arms about how their SOs masturbate. Men who don’t want women to use dildos or vibrators; women who don’t want men to watch porn (or some specific kind of porn); people of all genders who feel somehow rejected or even cheated on when their partner masturbates.

When someone wants to control what their SO wears or their hobbies or social life, everyone is quick to proclaim how controlling, boundary-trampling, and potentially abusive this behavior is. But when it comes to people laying out rules for how/if their SO can masturbate, somehow this is treated as a normal and okay thing for a partner to have control over.

This is NOT normal or okay. 

Your insecurities about your SO masturbating are not your SO’s problem. 

Being in a monogamous sexual relationship doesn’t grant you dominion over the other person’s body and mind. 

People get to think and fantasize about whatever tf they want, watch whatever tf kind of porn they want, and masturbate however and with whatever tf kind of toys they want. Trying to police that because you are insecure is totally inappropriate and controlling behavior. You should neither do this to a partner nor tolerate a partner doing it to you. 

Exceptions where it’s okay for a partner to make requests / impose their opinions:
- Excessive masturbation/porn addiction negatively impacts the couple’s sex life
- Matters of basic courtesy (e.g., don’t leave porn out on the computer; don’t do it in the bed next to me, etc.)
- When it involves interactions with real people (e.g., virtual sex workers or sexting with internet strangers)
- Obviously if it involves anything dangerous or illegal (e.g., public masturbation or self-asphyxiation).",0
Truckers are the most neglected and underappreciated professionals in the work force.,21841,1228,2020-03-20 09:20:52,"Title pretty much covers it. Truckers are often easy to complain about. Some of them are terrible drivers and disgusting people, but just like society, you get the good and bad equally. 

During this outbreak there will be folks working 16-18 hours so that everyone can get necessities to survive this. However, there will be little to no recognition for what we do/did in this pandemic. First and foremost the medical field deserves the top spot of recognition. Hands down. The next most appreciated that I've seen has been those that work in the grocery stores and public markets. While I don't fully agree they are in as much risk now, with a lot of companies restructuring to minimize their risk, I'll concede that, due to dealing with the crazies and the Karen's, they should be given their recognition. Beyond that, first responders and emergency personnel, companies taking care of their employees, governments response to the pandemic, financial relief, easing of burdens in this crazy time. 


Oh... and truckers can work more in the industries we need. I haven't seen a thanks, a nod, even a smile for what we are doing for you. No thought that this pandemic has put an even bigger strain on an already burdened industry. No concept that our work has doubled an already overburdened infrastructure. No nod for those delivering the goods the hospitals and markets need to continue operate. Just an expectation that we'll handle it. An ignorance to the key role of distribution put on the industry to keep things running. Without half of us everything will collapse.

"The reason for many movies that have a female lead failing is due to them not being written as an actual character, but instead as a no struggle, kickass person with no flaws or obstacles that block their goals.",21831,2660,2019-12-27 14:07:13,"Many movies, ""recently"" Captain Marvel, have the idea to make their characters with no flaws, and no difficulties in their lives with the ability to seemingly learn anything on a whim.

Many stories in there about hints girls dropped for guys. Some of them I read and think, ""I could see someone doing this in a truly platonic way.""

Personally, I have an experience I think about often. A coworker (girl) invited me over to get drunk on tequila and sleepover. When it came time to go to bed, I asked where I should sleep and she said ""Well you can sleep on the couch or you can come to the bed with me.""

I elected for the bed.

However I wasn't sure what her intentions were, and we had been drinking, so I didn't initiate anything and she didn't either. To this day I still don't know if it was a missed opportunity or a correct interpretation.

My opinion: is it really ""missed hints,"" or is it ""fear of misinterpreting and violating someone?""",0
"You can believe in God, and not follow a religion at the same time",21787,1813,2020-07-30 03:39:47,"I feel like God is a personal choice, whereas religion is something enforced on you either by your parents, the people you grew around with, or something else.

The problem is that religion is made by humans, whereas God is a central idea.

You can believe in Jesus Christ, and not take part in any religious activities.

You can believe in Allah, and not take part in Ramadan.

All the ideas from religion that are brought into culture come from humans themselves. If you truly believe in a God, then it should be alright for you to worship them without following any of the so called 'customs' a religion offers.

For instance, if you are a worshipper of Allah, you should not get mad when someone doesn't do the fast, nor should you be able to question their morals.",0
"As a former pothead, I consider marijuana to be a much more harmful drug than people consider it to be.",21769,2475,2020-06-26 22:57:16,"The thing about marijuana is not that it's physically harmful. It's mentally and emotionally harmful. It encourages you to use it habitually. It might not be physically addicting but it's certainly highly psychologically addicting. How many people do you know who use marijuana casually? The problem is that people abuse it frequently, and it causes them to suffer or atrophy in other areas of their lives, or they use it to cope with something else they're not willing to confront.

For me, I used weed as an excuse to not participate in society. Rather than see my friends I would just get stoned and turn off my phone. I wouldn't talk to anyone or go out. I was afraid to go out so I used weed as an excuse not to.

This caused me to have low self esteem. I thought of myself as a loser pothead - because I was. I think many potheads feel this way, but they would never admit it to anyone else.

But once I finally decided to drop it once and for all, my life has improved so drastically. I felt like a human again, like a member of society. And I realized that it hardly even did anything for me anyway. It turned me into a stupid person. I'm not stupid.

I think the damage that marijuana does is complex, but significant. I think the culture surrounding it and its reputation as a ""safe"" drug is extremely dangerous.

To quote the great and wise Randy Marsh:

>Well, Stan, the truth is marijuana probably isn't gonna make you kill people, and it most likely isn't gonna fund terrorism, but… well, son, pot makes you feel fine with being bored. And it's when you're bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or being creative. If you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you aren't good at *anything*.

edit: This thread really blew up so I would add on: if you feel you're in a similar situation to mine, my best advice is to reconnect with friends and focus on your abilities, skills, and talents. When I quit I focused more on my creative writing and that built my self esteem like crazy. I realized that the feeling of fulfillment and happiness I got from doing this every day was far greater than the meager feeling of being high that I got from marijuana. I'm now on track to finish my first novel by the end of the year.

A lot of comments are talking about how moderation is key and not everyone uses it the same. My question is: why use this drug at all? What does it help you with? And for whatever problem it is, is there another, more organic way you could solve this problem? For example if you have anxiety, maybe you can work on therapy or confronting this issue and trying to get some closure.

If you feel the need to get high every day, ask yourself: Do I enjoy life without this drug? And if not, try to figure out why that is and what could help to change it.",0

Encouraging children in school to have perfect attendance is detrimental to their health now and it forms unhealthy work habits that will follow them for the rest of their lives.,21703,1292,2020-01-30 00:34:54,"Schools, in my area at least, have been allowing fewer days for leave for sickness and becoming more strict on how and when those days are used. This is to encourage ""perfect attendance"" and it is harmful to the child in more than one way. 

1. The child is pressured into attending school even when sick, further suppressing an immune system that is already stressed by environmental factors. This can lead to a number of complications for the child, both short and long term, from leaving them susceptible to secondary infection, to the development of autoimmune disorders. If the child is taught to take proper care of their health and to heal when they are ill, then they will be better off in both regards.
2. The child is being conditioned to work ill. The future can never change to allow for better work conditions if the next generation does not progress beyond what the previous has. From a young age, American children are taught they must suck it up and work through it. Studies have shown that if a worker is given a generous sick leave, not only does the productivity go up but the medical cost goes down because the chances of serious illnesses are reduced. Workers can afford to stay home when they are sick. Our students are taught that working ill is what is expected of them and not only is it expected but most schools are tightening the noose and making it harder for the children to take leave when necessary. By the time an adult emerges from the school, they are used to ""shaking it off.""
3. The financial burden that is placed on a family because of policy change requiring doctors notes when insurance is not widely affordable, nor is a visit to a local doctor exactly cheap. A same-day visit to a local urgent care can easily run two hundred to three hundred dollars. This is also coupled with the hit already being taken by a parent that is missing work and may or may not have paid leave to do so. If a note is not returned to the school from a local doctor, at the very least the absence is unexcused and counts against the child, affecting everything from grades to driver licenses. In more strict counties and municipalities, a child can be counted truant without the doctor's note. Policies like these are ill-guided and do not produce the results desired. They impact grades and performance in a negative manner and hurt the morale of both parent and student.

Unfortunately, in today's world, schools influence our children more than we can ever realize. They shape much of their rationale and critical thinking skills that will follow them for the rest of their lives. As parents, it is up to each of us, to be active in trying to shape the policy that governs the school system.",0

But, the amount of Marvel fans that I see, both on Reddit and elsewhere, who circlejerk about the amazing 'cinematography' of Marvel films, and then proceed to show the same 4 colourful stills from Guardians or Endgame, is ***exhausting***, especially as a Marvel fan myself. 
 
Listen, pretty sparkly rainbow pictures don't automatically make a film artful, or cinematically significant. This is *especially* true when your entire business model is about mass producing the same superhero movie 20 times.
 
The reality of the matter is that the overwhelming majority of all Marvel films are shot in the same cookie-cutter manner. The framing is acceptable, the symbolism of shots is very, **VERY** heavy-handed at *BEST* - oh my god guyz, look, the 3 good guyz are in the light bit of the sky and the evil baddies are down in the dark bit wif the clouds behind them!!!! woaah!!!! good symbolism guyz!!!! - and a good 99% of the soundtracks are forgettable as all hell. Marvel's movies are fun action flicks, and that's totally fine, but I see so many people trying to peg each new MCU film as a visionary piece of cinematic art, and they really just aren't.

 
It's annoying, because it's not even like the superhero format invalidates a film as a medium for art. Like, look at Into the Spiderverse. That movie is absolutely pornographic. So is The Dark Knight. So is Man of Steel, arguably. So is Joker. But Marvel movies? Sure, they're good films, **but people need to stop pretending like the MCU is artistically significant or visually exceptional, because none of it is.** In my opinion, anyways.
 
This is coming from someone who *likes* Marvel films and grew up with/watched the *entire* MCU. It's the grilled cheese of cinema - it's cheap, it's fun, it's easy, it's simple. But don't try to pretend that it's caviar, because it just isn't.",0
Just because I don’t think I’m pretty doesn’t mean that I have low self esteem.,21570,626,2020-09-09 17:29:07,"A lot of the body positivity/body acceptance/high self esteem movement focuses on how you look. Phrases like “every body is beautiful” and “still hot despite X” are kind but misses the point for me. 

I’d rather the movements be focused less on validating that everyone is “pretty” and more on focusing on the ways you’re awesome period. Not awesome “despite” how you look, but just awesome. 

I’m not a California dime, and hey I get that. But I’m pretty damn valuable regardless. I’m reasonably smart and very driven. I enjoy my dry sense of humor (and I hope others do too). Obviously there’s other things, but the point is that I hate it when people start doing the “nooo stop it you’re beautiful” kinda speech. They want to assure me that I’m pretty, but all I’m trying to say is that not being beautiful isn’t a problem to begin with. 

Let’s focus on who we are as a whole. I get that “beautiful” can mean more than just how you look and there’s a huge difference between saying “everybody is beautiful” and “every body is beautiful.” Nevertheless, beauty typically takes the context of looks more than soul and I think the message ends up becoming about liking how you look vice liking who you are.",0

Even though there are tons of people who play GTA without committing mass shootings. As well as there are tons of BDSM fans who don't force people to have sex with them.

18+ people are capable of telling apart reality and fiction, and if they can't, they belong in an asylum. And our laws shouldn't be based on an assumption that citizens are incapable.

EDIT: PLEASE stop mentioning that ""porn is real and games are not"". Most people who blame sexual assault on porn also are against Hentai and they think it promotes pedophilia. Well, Hentai isn't real. It's animated cartoons about tentacle sex monsters.

EDIT2: Okay, games aren't 'real people'. But there's violence in movies, with real actors and graphic gore scenes. ",0
It should be the social norm to ask for recent STD test results before having sex,21388,1307,2020-07-05 10:27:08,"Assuming it's a hookup with someone you don't know well enough to be sure of their sexual health, this would encourage more people to actually get themselves tested and identified, reduce the amount of people feigning ignorance of their conditions to hook up, and overall have a positive effect on public health.

I was discussing this with a power mod who says that if you don't like the sub, you should just stop using it because it ultimately belongs to the creators or moderators. I understand that point of view for creative subreddits such as r/NotTheOnion, r/TIFU, r/ELI5 and the like, but subreddits that people got a control over just because they were at the right place at the right time, subreddits that someone else would definitely have created anyway, those communities belong to the users and not the moderators. subreddits like r/news, r/politics, r/soccer, r/pics belong more to the community than the people that created it. 

There aren't even a lot of communities with over a million subscribers, if the admins wanted to clean out the moderators and bring in new people it wouldn't take much work at all. The admins should feel some sense of responsibility when r/news removes important news stories just because it doesn't promote their agenda. ",0

"People receiving benefits should be prohibited from spending their money on alcohol, cigarettes, etc.",21267,4071,2020-08-22 20:47:08,"For those who may be confused by the title, I live in the UK and as part of our countries social security there is a benefits system in place which essentially allows people who do not have jobs or any form of income to receive money from the government to get by, and do not have to pay taxes. and all of this money comes from taxes payed by everyone else in the country. 

Whilst I don’t have a huge issue with this system, I’m not particularly all for it, but I feel that there need to be stricter rules on what people receiving benefits can do with the money they get given. If I am paying tax, and my government is using some of my tax money to give to people who do not have their own source of income, I accept that that money is given to them for them to spend on basic necessities such as food and rent and such, and to keep them on their feet until they are able to find themselves a job and begin making their own money. I do not agree with this money being given to them only for them to spend it on things such as alcohol or cigarettes, because it does not help their situation, and encourages them to not seek work and fuel their addictions.

"""You can't complain because x person has it worse"" is a really toxic idea.",21214,946,2019-03-24 23:17:55," Let me preface this by saying I do believe in being grateful for what you have. But there's a difference between that and using this argument to shut people up. I hate this for several reasons.

1. The people who say this almost never have it worse. They are usually putting words in the mouths of another group of people. I have a disability that limits my ability to walk. I don't complain about it much but I've been told not to because there are other people more disabled than me. I'm aware of that, but I've never been told this by someone who wasn't able bodied.

2. By the logic of this argument, the only people who are allowed to complain are dead or on the verge of death.

3. Complaining solves problems. Now, I can't speak for everyone with a disability, but I personally don't mind if an able bodied person complains about pain, as long as they let me do the same. In fact, I'm probably the best person you can complain to. I've had nerve and muscle pain for a long time and I grew up around lots of healthcare professionals, if you have pain, I might be able to help. 

4. Also prevents heart attacks because you let stress out when you complain. So even if it doesn't directly solve your problem, it lets off steam. Look it up.

5. Those people that actually have it worse aren't helped by my silence any more than they are by my complaints. Considering point 3, my complaining might actually help if I do it right. After all, isn't that what protesting is? Complaining on your own behalf or on the behalf of others to solve a problem? 

6. It's used to silence people who need help. I don't think I need to explain this part, you get it. 

7. It's human nature to complain. It just is. 

Just something I had to get off my chest, thanks.

Kinks and Fetishes don't belong at pride.,21202,1553,2020-07-07 13:21:57,"Kinks and fetishes are just a lil too personal to be brought into pride in my opinion. I mean yes, it's a part of your sexuality but I think it's something that should be left in the bedroom. Pride has become WAYYY too sexualized, and frankly it's just not cool. Particularly for all the youths who participate in pride too. If I were a parent I would not want my child to be exposed to people blatantly flaunting what exactly they do with their partners in the bedroom. 

(Disclaimer: I, myself am pan and totally support pride and people being themselves)

Edit:

I feel like I need to make this edit so people understand what I mean when I say I'm against kink at pride. What I think is acceptable is waving your fetish flag and wearing something that is related to your kink but is still family friendly, what I think is NOT ok is people running around almost completely naked while sucking on dildos and whipping each other's asses. Children should have a healthy understanding of sex and sexuality, but exposing them to THAT is not the way to go about it.

This is not to say that I agree or disagree with the nation's founding, as I am not an expert on the matter and I do not claim to be. Additionally, I recognize that during Israel's short existence, they have been attacked relentlessly from basically all sides. However, the way the country has treated Palestinians is entirely unacceptable. Innocent people are killed each and every day by Israeli forces as if it is nothing. Furthermore, the growing sense of nationalism around the world is alarmingly seen in Israel, as they are a wealthy and powerful nation, especially when compared to those around them. 

Ultimately, I feel as if religious states do not really work, and in no way am I excusing the wrongs that have been directed towards the Jewish people over many millennia. They will always lead to conflict among opposing sides, as it simply creates one more thing to argue about. However, the reality is that religious states do exist. I am not against a religious state for the Jewish people if there are to be nations represented by other religions.

Also in some states a individual can be put on the list for pissing on the side of the road or on a playground. There was actually a case of someone getting on the list because he took a piss at like 2 am in a park. It's just ridiculous!

We need to let some pet breeds die out.,20685,3214,2019-06-24 15:18:39,"We have destroyed what were once great creatures by selective breeding, and we need to let some of our ""creations"" die out.

Breeders don't give a shit about your car or dog, they don't care if they die years earlier than they should, or if they're prone to more diseases and health issues, they care about is your cash.

Of course I don't mean all breeds of animals when I say they should be bred out, but here are some examples of breeds I do mean:

French Bulldogs, Pugs, and other brachycephalic dog breeds: These dogs are often characterised as cute, with flat faces, but this causes their problems. Being bred to a point that their skulls are the wrong shape, causing lots of health problems, most notably breathing issues.

Munchkin Cats: Munchkin cats are dwarf cats, sausage cats, whatever you want to call them, are genetically bred to be dwarfs. If they had no health risks, I still think this is cruelty to cats, as it restricts what they were capable of. But, they have been reported to have higher instances of pectus excavatum (Hollowed chest), and lordosis (Curved spine).

This isn't even hard to achieve. Simply put a ban on breeders breeding these types of animals, and spay / neuter all the ones that are already owned / being sold.

But I doubt we'll do this for a long time, because so many people adore their horribly deformed pets that have resulted from shitty breeders.

That just because something like cancer is a massive problem in the world that takes the lives of a couple of thousand each year, it doesn't mean that you can't have a laugh about it. Why would you want to feel sad? Making jokes about sad topics is the easiest way of protecting yourself from the sadness that comes from it. Making jokes about paedophilia and such is just a way of getting out of the mindset that the world is a shit and miserable place. It's taking the darkest things imaginable and making them less depressing to look at or think about.

If you don't like that, then continue being a miserable fuck. I however will continue to laugh and enjoy myself.",0

Friendships should be about people helping each other to become the best version of themselves, not be 100% with the othe friend when they bully or lead a toxic life.The majority of them like that, not talking to their ""besties"" on their bullshit, I DON'T MEAN PUBLICLY. You do not have to agree with your friends knowing they are in the wrong because you're afraid they going to leave you, and YOU in turn do not have to get angry when they point and discuss your constant perceived negativity.

The number one reason people don't tell their friends about their wrongs, is because they are afraid of loneliness, I'd choose to be lonely over agreeing with stupid any damn day!

Edit 1 : This is one of those things we know but rarely talk about. I'm speaking of people who want to be as ""cool"" and ""virtue signaling unbiased"" as their friends who are rude to a waitress for example. You can tell them without being rude.[YOU CAN BE THE TOXIC FRIEND IF YOU ARE ALWAYS CALLING BULLSHIT ON PEOPLE TOO.]

People hear this and still support their toxic friends (they don't have to know from the start that they are toxic, but when it's a constant behavior they should get the hint). if i posted this on FB I'll get the famous normie phrase ""Dude, what the hell are you talking about?""

Money is essential to life as is furthering our bloodlines, but it's better to be financially stable first before creating a family because it costs money to have a good home, to feed ourselves, bathe, buy new clothes, have a car, insurance, and be well educated.

When I say this, though, I'm not saying women should give up financial responsibility or stop trying to be attractive. Reproduction may be important for all humans but financial stability has to come first.

The next generation SHOULD have it easier than the previous ones,20435,1012,2020-02-26 00:09:36,"This seems to be an issue with every generation and complaining about how the kids nowadays don't have to deal with X, have never had to Y or experience Z. Isn't that the entire of purpose of society and technology? We strive to eliminate unnecessary conflict that doesn't contribute to life in a meaningful way. It seems like every generation is called soft and coddled because they didn't have to experience some product of the time that isn't a necessity. The idea that men aren't men anymore and have it too easy because they don't have to fight pointless wars anymore just seems contradictory to the fundamental idea of progress.

If you're a parent, your entire goal should be to make the lives of your children easier than yours. Not only is this achieved through technology but by passing on the wisdom you've learned from your failures and successes.

Stop “normalizing” everything,20418,1410,2020-09-23 08:38:29,"I just saw a post that said ‘start normalizing not having weddings’ and I’m getting kind of tired of this theme. Do what YOU want.

Thank you all for the attention/awards! Not sure if it’s warranted but it is appreciated. And thank you to people who actually got my point. For the rest of you:

1. A lot of people seem to think I’m referring to weddings specifically but **I am not.** It’s a good example but purely that. 

2. Many comments say I’m “missing the point” and/or contradicting myself. So let me clarify, my problem is **not** with making things more socially acceptable. That’s great, and the point of this post. My problem is people thinking they can shift society with a tweet. 

Don’t talk about change just do it. Nothing changes if nothing changes. If you want to make something more acceptable then do it,  stop worrying what others or *society* think of it, and encourage those who want to do it also. There’s no need to go online and validate your decision to go against tradition.",0
The problem with dicussion on reddit is that negative karma encourages people to stop debating and go to subreddits that agree with them.,20390,1312,2019-03-21 21:16:41,"Negative karma discourages people from arguing against the majority view on a subreddit and instead going to a different subreddit where they are the majority view.

This happens because when you share these unpopular opinions; your comments get hidden making it harder for people to listen to what you say, especially for new users without much karma it can very easy to get banned, and users with unpopular opinions face a very hostile reaction in those subreddits.

Unfortunately there is an easy alternative, where you run to a subreddit which is the complete opposite, the majority agrees with you on your statements, you have the support of the community and positive reinforcement where people encourage you on.

This is poor for dicussion for many reasons but undoubtedly the most important is that people aren't as challenged on their ideas and beliefs drastically lowering the overall quality of discussion.

I would argue that my position is a minority argument and that most redditors would instead put the discussion problem down to the nature of argument on the site being very reactionary, with relatively little knowledge on the given subject matter.

People aren't homophobic. You're just weird.,20266,1800,2019-04-27 23:07:03,"I'm a gay guy. I've got a beard, a build, and I dress like most humans do.

I don't dress in drag and attempt to stick my anus in the faces of bewildered pedestrians at exhibitionistic pride parades. People know I'm gay, and you know how much homophobia I've experienced in my life? ZERO. Not even from ultra conservative people.

I talk about my sex life like heterosexual people do, and my friends support it. No one bats an eye. I don't try to fuck my straight friends, first of all because they are my friends, and secondly because they are straight. No one feels weirded out in my presence.

Much of what we call homophobia today isn't an inordinate fear of gay people. It's not even really a fear. More of a mild to aggressive weirded outness at guys who use their homosexuality as a staging ground for obtusely bizarre, exaggerated feminine behavior (girls mostly do not act like this version of feminine either lol).

It's ok to be weird. It's ok to be offensive. It's ok to act like a girl if you are a guy. Just don't be surprised if the majority of the population finds you odd. Because you are odd. And your oddities have dick all to do with the fact that you like dick, and no one is responding inappropriately because you like dick.

First off, to be clear I absolutely do not think that the US is perfect or even close, but to say something like ""its a third world country with iPhones"", is incredibly ignorant. To me its obvious that anyone who participates in that school of thought has never set foot outside the United States.

I haven't been everywhere, but I have been to most of the states, and many countries in both eastern and western Europe, South and Central America, and Asia.

People. The standard of living in the US is just straight up higher than the vast majority other countries. Even other countries that are also considered first world. Poverty levels are not even close to similar and someone who would be considered at the poverty line in America would line up with the average standard of life in most of the world.

Its not even just economics, socially, while I wont even argue for it being the best in the world, the states are certainly up there. Racism and discrimination do exist, but its not even close to the degree of racism or discrimination that can be seen in west Africa or Central America.

There's so much more depth that can be delved, but I am posting this as basically a rant and not as a research paper.

I also am not trying to say that the United States are better than any other country, just that the standard of living is generally higher.

Just some background as well I'm a college student from the Midwest and have lived in both rural, urban, and suburban areas of the US.

EDIT: Again everyone, like before mentioned, I'm not saying the US is the best, nor am I saying its above criticism.

When its the middle of November, everyone is talking about how many sleeps there are until Christmas, what they want, what they’re getting people etc. The majority of people are happy and in a festive mood blasting happy Christmas songs while putting up their decorations while wearing Christmas jumpers. 
The day it becomes December every one is opening their advent calendars with Christmas on their mind from the start of the day to the end of the day. Games, series, animated series are making a Christmas themed episode or items for their game.
On the 24th of December, everyone is talking about Christmas, everyone is happy and exited to get there presents Christmas music is being blasted out of every house. 
Then it’s Christmas. You get what you want, you eat Christmas dinner and now there’s nothing to be exited for. You’re just spending the day using what you got completely disregarding the fact that it’s Christmas.

Wanting a weapon to protect yourself at home is NOT weird,20002,6412,2020-02-14 20:52:43,"If I do not feel safe at my home and have the desire to arm myself it is completely fine to rely on a gun for protection.
Here in Germany we have a huge anti-weapons movement which grows stronger year by year, and every time someone goes nuts and shoots people the public outcry against legal gun ownership is huge and I cannot stand this.

Personally I live in a big city with millions of other people but I do not feel safe anymore, it does not matter why (it’s NOT due to the refugees, never had problems with them). So I did my hunters license and bought a few guns, for hunting and protection. Most of my friends have distanced themselves from me, calling me weird and some even calling me a fascist. This is not only wrong, but really hurtful as well - all I want is some reliable protection and my guns make me feel a lot safer than before.

I do not wish to carry my gun outside my home, but I understand people who would like to be allowed to do that.


Side note: gun laws in Germany are really strict. There are very few ways to obtain a gun legally and every gun has to be registered, written down in your owners license and once a year the police comes to your home and checks on the way you store them. You need to own a safe and keep all guns locked inside that safe


EDIT: since this gets asked so much. I have to store my guns in a safe, but I’m still able to get them really quickly. It’s a „easy access“ safe, with a fingerprint lock (and of course it only accepts MY fingerprint). I am allowed to store a full magazine close to my gun, so readying up takes something between 20-30 seconds.

My issue is the cost of living. Where I live, minimum wage is nowhere near what's needed to rent a home and pay for bills and food without WIC, going in debt and other forms of government support. The last job I worked was $12 an hour with 10 hours of overtime ($18/hr) per 2 weeks and I was barely scraping by.

Even if I get a $20 an hour job, those minimum wage jobs still need employees, and those employees need housing. 

Sure, I could call people and fill out paperwork to get reduced housing and free food, but then I'd be part of the group that people complain about, who live off tax money, and programs like that shouldn't even have to exist. Poor people who are able to work, and are, shouldn't have to jump through hoops just to get what they need.

As a minimum wage worker, I have no choice but to live with someone else and pay them what I can for rent.

Note: I'm searching for other jobs daily, and I have an interview with a high(ish) paying job on Tuesday, so hopefully I get hired!

I don't feel oppressed by capitalism and I'm not rooting for communism. (obligatory, given the current state of the world). I just find it to be a minor inconvenience. I wouldn't mind living in a tent in the woods until I can afford better, but that's pretty much illegal now within driving distance of any possible employment.

I'm not advocating for any initiative or new laws, just pointing out that I don't believe it should be like this in the first place",0
Tipping is a practice that should be done by choice not because everyone else does it,19946,4259,2020-02-17 19:41:14,"I just stumbled recently onto a post about the tipping in America. Everyone in the comments were having mixed views while there were a few that were adamant that anyone who is against tipping is stupid. In my opinion, tipping someone is a very fucked up culture, if it is done due to the customer feeling like service is an unforgettable one, tip by all means. But it seems like in the US, tips are a must even if you get good service, shitty service or even if you get good service but you just don't want to pay so much for service, e.g. you have a bill of $200 and you're required to give a tip of 20%. Even if a service is top notch, we shouldn't be required to pay $40 just for service when that $40 is enough to pay for another meal in itself. In the post I previously talked about, a lady kept saying ""If you refuse to tip, you can just go to McDonald's"". I feel that's a stupid statement. We're customers, not your employers. We go there to eat, not for the service. All we need is for you to take the order and to bring us our food, that's all we want, that's what you're getting paid for. Most waiters and waitresses feel entitled to get tips when it's not the customers responsibility to give you money all because you're not being paid enough. What difference is that from begging? They should be mad at the employer, not the customer, this is something the government should fix, not something the customer needs to do to make things less shitty",0

"Assisted suicide should be available to all above the age of 18 for free, but with a twist",19817,2224,2019-07-09 02:26:33,"Basic idea:
- aviable to everyone above 18 years of age
- free
BUT:
- one has to go through a ""resocialization"" program
- programm tries to re-establish the will to live, through learning new skills, finding work, meeting people, etc 
-> fixing the person's problems

If after 6 months no ""resocialization"" is reached, the person will get the assisted suicide

A much needed edit:
- The time limit has been selected ""randomly"" and is a placeholder
- the ""resocialization"" Programms goal is to get the person into a state of willingness to live, by solving the person's problems, be it by therapy or some other way
- the free aspect seems to irritate some people who don't want to fund it with their tax, how about funding it with the taxes from rich people/corporations instead?

It's okay to kick your pregnant teen out of the house.,19438,3905,2020-05-03 09:41:43,"Y'all wanted some unpopular opinions, well, come get your juice!

Sex is for adults. You play adult games, you get adult prizes (children) and thus adult responsibilities.

It is not the parent of the teen's responsibility to take care of their grandchild, that includes housing and utilities, food, everything a teen parent would get by living at home. The parent's did not consent to having a new baby in the house. Also, the parents might still be raising their own younger children and do not have the time or energy to have a new baby in the house.

If the teen wants to be pregnant and have the baby, then they need to be adults and provide for their own child. The teen's parents (baby's grandparents) can do fun grandparent things like babysit once a month or buy them fun toys,  but it's not their responsibility to provide the necessities.

I do think it's best if they give the teen a reasonable timeline to move out. Ex: move out before the baby is born or move out before baby turns 3 months old.

I'm also not saying that the parents absolutely have to make their teen leave if they're okay with the teen and their baby living there. I just get tired of people hating on parents on pregnant teens because they forced the teen to be responsible for the sheltering of their own child.

EDIT: RAPE CASES! So this doesn't apply to rape cases because the teen didn't choose to have sex. While a teen girl would still have the choice to abort or adopt out, I do think her parent's should a bit more because it's not her actions that caused her to be in this situation. A raped teen boy can't do much. He didn't choose to have sex, he doesn't get to choose abortion or adoption.

EDIT 2: TEEN DAD: Many asked if this treatment only applies to the girl. It does not. You can kick out the teen dad too. I just think the process might be different for the teen dad and his parents because ultimately it's up to the teen mom about abortion and adoption.

EDIT 3: I am pro-sex education and pro-access to abortion. When you get pregnant, you have 3 choices. Abortion, adoption, or parenting. Consider everything (including shelter and finances) and make the right choice for you. A choice you'll have to take responsibility for.

LAST EDIT BEFORE BED: So I removed that landlord line, because it turns out I was wrong and think of it in a more unapproved roommate way.

Anyway, what I want people to understand is that when a person gets pregnant there are 3 options: abortion, adoption, and parenting. Each comes with its ups and downs.

The parents of the teens cannot make the decision for them or force them any which way. So if the parents cannot force the teen to abort/adopt out then the teen is also not entitled to raise their baby at their parent's house just because they had chose to have a child young.

If we keep saying that teens are not capable of making adult decisions, then why give them the decisions to birth and raise the child? If the parents are still responsible for them and their fertility no matter what, then the parents would have the ability to make the choice regarding the teen's pregnancy. But they don't. It's up to the teen if they want to keep and raise the baby, so it is also up to the teen to provide for the baby, shelter included. 

Also, we already have certain pre- age18 cases in which teens suddenly become adults. Certain crimes, usually violent ones. They'll be tried as adults. Choosing to become a parent (instead of abortion or adoption) is another way a teen crosses that threshold, imo. We let teens drive, work, babysit and make plenty of other choices. We don't monitor them like 2 year olds because they have better decision making skills then that. Same with sex. Teen pregnancy is not a failure on the parents and neither is the choice to keep the baby. It's up to the teen and their choice. ",0
Shaming men for being virgins is unhealthy and cruel.,19419,1333,2020-05-07 06:58:28,"Yes, men, because women are rarely shamed for being virgins at any point in life. I encourage everyone who's bombarding me in the comments to make your own post about how women are shamed for whatever.

This double standard baffles me, it's like men's virginity is worthless and should be lost as soon as socially acceptable, at an age which gets younger and younger as the years go on. It pushes boys to try to sleep with any girl they meet to get their imaginary social ""sex quota"", which can lead to harassment, and leads virgin men to think they're undesirable losers and something's wrong with them. Men have to decide themselves when they're ready and when they've found the right person, rather than being pushed by social norms.

"If it’s socially acceptable for women to put “Sorry, no short men” as a requirement in online dating profiles, then it should also be acceptable for men to say “Sorry, no flat-chested women”, or “no overweight women” in theirs.",19399,2670,2018-10-26 13:01:06,"I understand that a women may only want a guy of a certain height for whatever reason they may have. That’s fine. You are attracted to who you are attracted to and there is nothing wrong with that. 

Maybe she just wants to warn a guy before wasting their time with meeting up somewhere, or stop them from getting their hopes up. I get that too. 

However, if a man were to say  “Sorry, no (blank)  women”, they would get accused of body shaming and everyone would lose their shit. 

It’s a double standard, and its absolute bullshit. Whereas someone would say of the woman “Oh, she’s just very selective and knows what she wants”, they would say of the man “What a pig! How dare he!”. No one would ever say “He’s just very selective and wants to find the perfect soul mate”.

There's NO WAY 50 cent was ALWAYS in da club with a bottle full of bub,19329,454,2020-01-03 23:57:10,"I refuse to believe 50 cent could always be found in the club. Surely he couldn't be there 24/7 during the morning and day times too?

What happens off school grounds is not the school's business.,19218,973,2020-07-23 23:14:24,"First off, I want to name the the only two exceptions: 1. school events (such as sports) as I see these as being an extension of school grounds.  2. Private schools, by nature, have the right to refuse business with anyone for any reason other than protected classes. So they could terminate schooling for a child that breaks their store/school policy. This means I am talking solely about public schools. 


Now, straight to my main point. If a student stays up at night watching TV, none of the schools business. If a student fights another student at the local Walmart parking lot, none of the schools business. If a student is sitting in the mall, tweeting about how much of a **** Karen is.... none of the schools business.

That's it, that's my point. Now as a concerned organization, the school can call/email the legal guardian of the kid to let them know that they feel the behavior deserves attention. Such as ""we noticed little Johnny is sleepy in class, just wanted to let you know he might need a better sleep schedule"" or ""a kid showed one of our staff a video of your kid beating up another kid in broad daylight, we just thought you should know"" (if applicable, they might also report it to athorities). As a concerned organization, they might offer counseling to victims of violence and torment, but  if the crime happened off school property they are in no position to offer any kind of justice.

Edit: well this is taking off. First of all, rip my inbox. It is about 60% disagree, 40% agree. 

I do want to add a tid bit. I don't have time to re-structure my post to be bullet proof against all edge cases. I will say this though, generally I think the police and judicial system should handle most the issues y'all have. Those systems should not only investigate off campus issues, but also prevent them from occuring again in any place, especially schools.

To that I say, it is worth trying to implement to avoid the countless examples of overreaching schools as posted in the comments by various redditors.

It’s just annoying to me that when people say they’re depressed and society sucks, and they joke about (or are serious about) killing themselves, no one ever offers real solutions but just says “call this random number and talk to someone, oh I just know how you feel I’ve been there before”

If I was going to get out of it, I was going to have to be the one to make changes. At face value it sounds silly, but I really internalized this idea. I forced myself to stop relying on other people for my own happiness. It made me a more cynical person towards society as a whole, but damnit if it didn’t help I don’t know what did. Realizing society’s shortcomings were what put me in that place to begin with made me understand that in order to overcome, I was going to be the only one that could truly change my own personal mental well being. I took this mentality to heart, and started focusing on things like hobbies. It wasn’t easy, but I spent my time learning to do things like play guitar, or build circuits, or get really good at a certain video game, or produce beats, etc. This idea may be a crock of shit, but I gave this advice to another one of my depressed friends telling them I thought the advice people generally give is bullshit. I actually found that giving a bleak response of understanding and being real with them and not being all “yeah, talk to someone!” Etc. was more helpful. If you can actually relate to how that depressed person feels instead of just telling them everything will be okay, you have a better chance of helping. They don’t want to hear “everything is okay”, they want to hear “yeah you’re right everything really is fucked.” If you can truly relate to them and the way they feel without trying to tell them how to fix it explicitly, they’ll appreciate it.

Edit 2: I should have been more explicit when I wrote this. I'm sure hotlines help some people, I'm not saying they don't. I'm also not saying therapy doesn't help people.

Edit 3: Here's an analogy. Your friend is in a hole (depression). You're standing outside of the hole. You're shouting phone numbers down into the hole and saying things like ""you're gonna be fine, it's okay"". In reality, it would be much more helpful if you could jump into the hole with them and show them the way out.

John Lennon was a piece of crap person and a piece of crap singer who doesn't deserve the hype around his life.,19058,1672,2019-03-17 23:27:03,"He was a known wife beater who often flew into uncontrollable fits of rage that he directed to the various women in his life.  Lennon resented his son Julian, and narcissisticly blamed the boy for a marriage he did not want to be in. After Lennon divorced his wife, he took off with Yoko Ono and dropped out of his son’s life for years. Julian has stated that Paul McCartney was far more of a father to him than John ever was. 

John was a pathological liar who claimed he had been raised in a working class family in Liverpool when he was actually raised in a comfortable upper middle class home. He often claimed to be single during his early years of stardom, despite being married. He claimed to have met Yoko Ono at an art show; falling in love at first sight, when in fact, Ono had stalked him for months before he gave in to her.

John claimed to have lost interest in the Beatles due to Paul McCartney’s tendencies toward pop music when in fact, he had spent two years in a daze as a result of a serious addiction to heroin. Together, he and Yoko  destroyed the Beatles, then he blamed the breakup on Paul McCartney. 

He was politically clueless and gave money to publicity violent and radical groups such as the Black Panthers.

He was no better than an average guitar player who mostly confined his playing to the basic rhythm parts and his piano playing was amateurish. 
His song writing was no better;  The lyrics to Strawberry Fields Forever and Come Together are pure drug induced hippie psychedelic babble.

Lennon was a raging hypocrite who lived the do as I say, not as I do life perhaps more flamboyantly than anyone. All you have to do is look at his songs. Lennon, who sang Imagine no Possessions lived a millionaire’s life in a posh New York hotel.  Lennon sang Imagine no Religion, while he was was obsessed with every spiritual and New Age fad that came along, including Hindu meditation, the I-Ching, and astrology of all kinds.  And it was Lennon who sang All you need is Love, yet lived a violent, and angry life while abusing his family and friends. And it was Lennon who sang about having nothing to kill or die for helped finance radical and violent political groups.

Lennon was a piece of shit and the world should know this about him.

Great, so it allows business to not have to pay taxes before they've taken out the costs of doing business.

Regular Joe however, pays taxes on their gross income which is massively unfair compared to businesses, my rent, food, bills and transport costs are also my cost of doing business. They are not optional, without those I cannot earn the money to make the salary I am paid.

The IRS wouldnt have extra work to do either, they already look at tax submissions of businesses and see what their revenue and deducted business expenses were, they could do that for you and me too.

Tangled was a better movie than Frozen,18636,773,2019-11-10 03:59:52," Tangled had a better storyline than frozen. Tangled was about escaping a toxic environment and finding one's self. For all rapunzel's life, she was stuck in a tower having one view of life. Her mother told her that the world was cruel and unforgiving. While her mother was partially right about the world, (the Stabbington brothers were kind of evil) they also were good people. While on her adventure, she learned not to judge based on appearance. She even had a musical number with people that were considered thugs. Rapunzel was also an Icon. She didn't need Eugene but knew when to accept help. She saved Eugene and herself many times during the movie with a frying pan. Even the song ""I see the light"" was better than let it go. The song is about her finding the light and finding a new perspective with Eugene. She admits that she was blind when she was in the tower. Let it go is a good song but its not as good as ""I see the light""",0

You CANNOT decide what job would suit you based on what you learn in high school.,18599,811,2020-05-20 18:19:52,"People often assume that if they excel in a subject. they should get a job related to it. This is WRONG. High school subjects are the basics of the basics.

For example, if a student sucks at math, he or she automatically assumes that he/she shouldn't get a math related job like an economist or an engineer.

But high school math is COMPLETELY different from math you will use in real life. High school math is all about tests and exams. You solve problem sets that are designed just for the purpose of making you fail.

In real life, though, it's different. For most math-using jobs, it's just a tool to get the job done. I can name more things that are different, but it would take way too much time.

In conclusion, planning out your future in high school is the STUPIDEST thing you can possibly do.

I’m tired of the racism and heterophobia coming from “woke” POC and LGBTQ+ communities,18591,2150,2018-12-05 01:24:16,"I’m a pansexual black/Cuban poet who has been doing slam poetry for 5 years. Throughout these 5 years I’ve seen so many people who swore they were “woke” proceed to do a poem that isn’t much more than hating white people and bashing straight people. At the end of these poems, most POC go insane with applause, and the white people in the room all clap along too, even though they’ve done nothing but try to be an ally. 

This kind of behavior can be seen on social media too.  A person of color can post anything about white people. They can post anything from a joke that uses white people as the punch line to straight up saying “I hate white people” and be fine. Same thing with queer people and straight people. 

And I get it. I’m Black, Cuban, queer, and a woman. I’m made up of two races that have been enslaved, tortured, and shunned. My gender has been put down for centuries. I would’ve had to force myself into the closet if I was born a couple of centuries earlier. I know what it’s like to be hated for who I am. I know what it’s like to feel angry for what’s been done to my ancestors, and my queer brothers, sisters, and siblings. But I don’t compliment these poems. I don’t applaud. I don’t like these posts. Because it’s wrong. This is the same kind of ignorant hate being flung by the homophobes and racists on the other end. This is all just tit for tat. 

You’re not woke if you:

- Make racist/ sexist/ straight bashing jokes and can’t take it back in your direction. 

-Use generalizations like “all white people” or “all straight people” but then get mad when someone uses generalizations like “all black people” or “all queer people. 

-Refuse to talk or communicate with someone simply because they’re a white straight cis man but then feel angry that someone doesn’t want to interact with you because you’re a queer person of color. 

-Push allies away when they’re trying to help you. 

-Think you’re better than anyone because of your identity. 

Everyone has the right to be who they want. To be proud of their identity. You have no control over what you are and who you are and you shouldn’t be hated and put down for it. But you shouldn’t put another person down just to lift yourself up. 

Next time you write a status or a poem about the “other” side, insert blanks on every time you name them. Insert something represents you into the blanks. Then read the poem and visualize someone from the “other” side reading it back to you. Do you feel put down? That’s what you’re doing to others. 


TLDR: Love yourself but don’t put other people down in the process.

Edit: I explained this wrong here and I put freedom of speech because my bad understanding of that. My point here is that everything you counter-argue, much of the answers are toxicities (memes mocking your argument, meaningless fancams, among others). It is a very small percentage of people who counter-argue based on good sources.

- Due to toxicity, one leaves that social network with downcast spirits.

- Everyone is offended by everyone and everything.

- For them, the ""only people who are right"" are the ones with the most likes. Pathetic.

- Cancellation culture, the worst of that social network. Literally all of those cancellations are about fandoms on fire for tiny and insignificant details that they don't like, or just wanting to cancel anything for no reason.

Your trigger words are not a stranger’s responsibility,18456,1330,2019-11-17 09:36:39,"As respectful human beings, we have a personal decency to cater for any preferences in the room. It’s common empathy. But there’s a highly uncharismatic sense of entitlement to the one who walks into a house and expects every unmet character to know they’re offended by the word “cheesecake.” While it’s unfortunate that “cheesecake” makes you feel unsafe, or brings you back to a traumatic past, no one is accountable for knowing that UNTIL THEY’VE BEEN TOLD. The whole point of meeting someone, is you explore each other’s qualities’ and acquire knowledge that makes the next encounter more convenient. So unless you tailor a varsity bomber jacket that says “CHEESCAKE WAS A DARK TIME” then you can’t berate them for attacking you with the gun they didn’t even know they had.

This can apply to more than trigger words. Some examples I’ve witnessed are:
- bf/gf expects you to know why they’re mad without context
- punished for breaking a rule that was never provided to you
- called to someone not knowing they had a name change

Now, there is a grey line to this. If you believe someone has a “trigger” topic, you can choose from the goodness of your own heart to avoid it. That’s courtesy, and you’re simply a nice person. On the flip side, if you knew deep down they probably wouldn’t like it, and brought it up to get a kick out of using “I didn’t know” as an excuse, then you just suck.

If all these incidents we hear about in the news were reported back when they occurred, I think we would see alot better punishment of the offenders. If your house gets broken into, you report it. If you witness a murder or someone tries to kill you, you would report it.

1) my issue is not with how the kids behave - they are too young to know better. Their entitled ass parents however, should know better. 


2) I'm in the UK, this was not a matinee showing. Even if it was, I refuse to believe that it is ok to bring your young child to a movie they cannot understand, follow, sit still or be quiet for. Some people work shifts, or evenings and weekends, and cannot see it at 11pm. Other people have paid their damn money and you, by bringing your children for' family time's just because YOU want to see the movie, are ruining it for others. Get a damn babysitter.


3) some might say this is a popular opinion. I'll tweak it: I should be allowed to slap people who bring children that talk / make a disturbance in the cinema. 

I made this post on the basis that it was unpopular, due to THE SHEER NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO STILL DO IT. THEY SEEM TO THINK IT IS OK. So yeah that's where I'm coming from.",0
You should not have to pay child support to a kid that isn't yours,18321,2680,2020-01-20 14:35:15,"It's ridiculous that a woman can lie to you that you're the father and later on when you find out you are not the father the courts can still make you pay child support for a kid that's not yours.

A 'dislike' button on Facebook would actually significantly change the world...for the better,18231,724,2019-02-05 23:50:42,"The title of this post might seem extreme on the surface, but I do believe this to be true. The absence of a dislike button on Facebook warps public opinions on some serious matters, and I believe it also influences peoples own opinions.   


The only way to counter a comment you don't agree with or are offended by is to put an Angry emoji or comment. The angry emoji is misleading and is often used to demonstrate your dislike of the subject at hand and not the comment itself. Commenting just opens up arguments, abuse and takes time. Giving people a 'dislike' option, very much like the down vote system on here would change this...  


Imagine being a generally ignorant, racist, bigoted idiot and commenting something obscene online? You might post a comment that really offends 18,000 out of 20,000 people, but it shows 2k likes by like minded idiots. This sends out the wrong message. This tells people who are just passing that the opinion is popular, there is a lack of balance without the effort of commenting and getting involved in a spat. Add the dislike function and suddenly the comment has 2k likes but 18k dislikes, which tells people that this is an unpopular view point and might make people think twice about what they say, or take a rain check on their attitudes.  


It would give people the freedom to disagree without engaging, it would add balance to the site, and considering how much political debate there is on there at the moment, I think it is IMPORTANT.  


Yes I know its a social media site, but we have to take it seriously now. It influences people, some people live on there. Facebook impacts the world.  


TLDR; Facebook needs a dislike button for the sake of balance and reducing online arguments",0
"The old era of the internet was the golden age and mass popularity, social media killed what made the internet 'magical'",18199,878,2020-02-23 17:50:42,"I miss when websites and entire communities were for the community and not for money/clout. If you're anywhere between 20-40+ right now you've probably experienced a good chunk of the 'old internet' which I would place around 1990s - 2005/2010(?). 


What made it so special was it was never like TV/cable, holly wood, or tabloids, it was different. It was truly free, commercialization and corporate take-over was thought to be unlikely because anyone that was a frequent user was a 'nerd' or 'geek.' Anonymity was valued because it was never about the individual, but rather the actual content of whatever the site was about, forums centred around interests without users trying to make a living out of it, get internet points or gain clout.


IRC, BBS, AOL, UseNet and the sort ruled as the means of interacting with others anonymously, IRC was super interesting with how it developed and broke apart in their 'wars', takeovers and raids on each other's networks. The old internet was sort of like an anarchy, there wasn't much regulation, there was so much weird and interesting stuff out there.


From old sites from the 90s, **ahem 18+ content which stole everyone's innocence, hacker-culture (REMEMBER ANONYMOUS? LULSEC?) which led to real world implications like students hacking school systems, bigger organised groups for better or for worse targeting large corporations,  the Dark net was feared and the ultimate last stage of the internet where the bravest or most insane went to. Memes lasted years and inside jokes didn't have an expiry date of a week.


The first Eternal September happened in 1993 and the next major one came in the early 2010s.

* Youtube has gone downhill ever since 2012, quality of videos has increased but equally or more so click-bait content and shit you'd see on bloody TikTok. 'Influencers' rule the site making content you expect to see on TikTok---- 
* Facebook was for once College students to connect and hang or whatever, not many people used it, and those who did weren't using it to fish for likes/reacts until like 2010, now it's the hub of impressionable old folk, massive echo chambers, misinformation tactics and meme pages who steal memes from each other.


* Reddit used to be a hub for somewhat serious or at least interesting discussion, you were encouraged to think before you post, if you used emojis or typed lazily you'd be ridiculed. It was more akin to a forum than a social media because that's what it IS. We shat on all the other social media for being 'stupid'. Then Reddit entered a new era catering to the broadest audience possible, cracked down on the more interesting and outrageous subs which made Reddit different from other sites; /r/WatchPeopleDie was the last bastion of that part of Reddit. Subreddits that enticed interesting discussions like /r/AskReddit /r/ShowerThoughts or even /r/Tifu became grounds for sexy sex time posts and one-liners. The site isn't so bad, but the majority of the content on /r/All is shit you see on Facebook, Twitter or any OTHER 'social media' site, what made Reddit special was that it was different, content was never centred on politics, low-effort reposts, influencers/youtubers/celebrities, or /r/funny type shit. It was diverse but not *that* stupid.
* Anonymity was always important in the old internet, privacy nowadays is practically dead for the majority, no one gives a shit about their privacy, and they willingly gave it away in exchange for convenience. It's stupid easy to dox anyone on the internet now, I remember it being actually impressive when someone was able to track your real name etc because that was something you'd actively try to hide.
* **Big corporations didn't integrate themselves onto the internet and try to monetize everything.** In my opinion the biggest appeal of the internet was that it was different, there was always something to discover and it was **community driven.**


I don't dislike the nowadays era of the internet, but there are things I certainly miss about the old.


E: WOAH, this blew up! I'll read everyone's responses for tea :^)


E2: Some thoughts and hopefully the final edit. 


* It's fascinating to hear your experiences of the old era, whether we agreed or not! This is the type of shit I want to see; **an actual discussion**.
* As I was writing it and before I hit post I did feel I might've been too *harsh* sounding; as if I don't appreciate what we have today.
* Everything has a natural peak and decline, there were better days. But the experiences I've had past and present matter the most. I'm happy to have had the experiences and to continue gathering more. /r/Place was my favourite thing ever and no other experience I've had in the past comes close. 


I'll see you guys in ten years when someone writes a post missing this era's internet when we had freedom on the internet and *1984* was a joke and not reality. ^^^right ^^^guys?",0
Making the bed is a pointless chore and a waste of time.,18191,1587,2019-03-01 23:39:00,"Sure, it looks aesthetically pleasing, but the following night you're just going to mess it up again!

There's nothing gained from it other than satisfaction, it's stupid.

"The world needs to stop lumping all Africans together. Africa is a very diverse, multi-cultural continent, with very complex issues that are very difficult to approach and solve.",18101,1035,2020-07-18 08:23:31,"Africa is often referred to as a ""country"" and the people are often seen as a monolith. Africa is quite diverse, consisting of a mixture of countries with various ethnicities that each have their own unique characteristics. 

Around a hundred languages are widely used for inter-ethnic communication. Arabic, Somali, Berber, Amharic, Oromo, Igbo, Swahili, Hausa, Manding, Fulani and Yoruba are spoken by tens of millions of people. The total number of languages natively spoken in Africa is variously estimated (depending on the delineation of language vs. dialect) at between 1,250 and 2,100, and by some counts at ""over 3,000"". Nigeria alone has over 500 languages (according to SIL Ethnologue), one of the greatest concentrations of linguistic diversity in the world.

Africa has a large amount of different ethnic groups, each with their own languages. Africa has an incredibly high amount of genetic diversity [due to an assortment of environmental factors throughout the continent as well as human migration and dispersal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2953791/). This makes sense, considering that humans originally dispersed from here.

Common misconceptions of Africa include the ideas that everyone lives in poverty and there are no growing industries or opportunities. While it’s true that a lot ofpeople live in extreme poverty, many people simply do not see past the statistics to gain a deeper understanding about the root of the problems. Furthermore, many people fail to understand that not every African country is poor, and that Africa is, in fact, quite rich in some growing areas.

When it comes to oil and gas potential, especially, Africa is not poor. In 2013, the majority of the global discoveries in the oil and gas sector were made in Africa, and there are hundreds of companies surveying the area. [Nine-tenths of Africa’s annual production volume of gas is exported from Nigeria, Libya, Algeria and Egypt](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/18/business/africa-oil-gas-potential-boom-hype/).

While it still remains largely underexplored, Africa’s potential for oil is positioned to grow significantly over the next two decades. The global market can change quickly, but there is evidence to support Africa’s position as an oil and gas leader in the future. Mineral reserves in Africa are also abundant. 

Global news tends to focus on the negative, so many people around the world only hear of the wars, disease, and poverty that the continent has experienced. The news rarely covers anything about the emerging middle class in Africa countries, the beautiful locations on the continent, and other positive aspects.",0

Social media was a fucking mistake.,18063,1109,2020-05-31 01:17:57,"Humans were better off without social media. With the advent of the internet it was inevitable, but we have definitely lost something good and replaced it with the most toxic shit you can think of. 

Every day on multiple Facebook posts I see people, even family members, treat each other like *shit* over either something political or things that don’t even matter. All over what, fake internet points? Twitter is worse and Instagram is just mindless. Humans turn into a disgusting pack of mongrels when they log onto their social media accounts. Maybe it just shows cowardice above anything else. You don’t see many people talk like that to each other’s face.

It seemed like, for a while there in the 90’s and early 2000’s, we were doing alright.  Race-related hate was on the decline, people seemed to get along better, a thousand other examples. I suppose social media only served to bring negative feelings that were already there to light, but is that necessarily a good thing? Absolutely not. 

Sure, social media has been a helpful tool for many people and for many purposes. But all of that comes at the cost of risking our relationships with others and that is far too steep a price. I’ll be honest, I’m fucking afraid to even post to my Facebook wall anymore. I love my family much more than my opinions and I would hate to go down that route.

If all forms of social media shut down tomorrow, there’d be butthurt for some time but I guarantee the world would become a better place.

 I went to a legal shop here in Montreal and left slmost immediately due to the overwhelming douche baggery happening in there.

I notice that my acquaintances and friends who tend to be very accomplished people, and are the epitome of the successful man tended to be some of the realest and most genuine people around me. For example the traits they shared would be: athletic accomplishments in sports, lifting, strong career and academic goals, involvement in clubs and student activities (both in HS and college), traveling, open mindedness, self created good appearance (due to taking care of self and clothing), and humble/positive personalities. I’ve had lab mates who went to Oxford and Harvard who I wouldn’t have even suspected gone to such schools, because when you talk to them,  they wanted to know about you and really laid back people. You know they’re awesome people from just the way they carry themselves.

I had former friends and acquaintances who were the opposite. For example one example of a former close I had was somebody who barely got through high school and participated in nothing back then. After, he would be extremely stubborn about getting a job, going to a job training program, or putting himself in positions to meet new people, ect. His ass was just sitting around broke and always creating drama with other people, while mooching off others. He did not work out much, yet bragged constantly about his childhood accomplishments, claiming to have played 10 different sports. He always talked about being alpha and tried to act like the top dog around others. People initially are drawn to his charm and good social skills, but over time they see the truth that he’s just a total loser.

People who keep their dogs outside 100% of the time are total trash.,17917,1580,2020-05-21 10:03:37,"I get it different strokes for different folks and all that but keeping your dog/s pinned up in the backyard all day and night is downright deplorable. 

Your animals should be seen as family and treated like so. You wouldn't throw Gramgram out in the yard in +85 ° weather just cause you don't want her on the couch. When you get a dog you gain an equal member of the family. Period.

It kills me to see my neighbors dogs out in the yard 24/7 just... Existing.. I know theyre home but they just leave them there to die of boredom and absolutely beg for attention.. ugh it breaks my heart because what kind of life is that for them? It's the same thing as locking them in a cage for hours on end but it's just bigger.. only coming out to tell at them to shut up and scream.. 

I honestly don't see the point in getting a dog at all if all you plan to do with it is outta sight out of mind it in the yard till the day it dies. All that's doing is abusing the poor creature, its wrong, its cruel, and its just downright not how you doggone treat a pupperoni. 

I may be biased cause my dogs are spoiled as hell and I grew up in a house that always had dogs sharing a couch and a bed with us but seeing how lonely and bored my neighbors dogs are kills me inside and makes me hold my babies even more.

Edit: For all the people who think I'm bashing the dream life of a farm dog, I'm not. I truly do believe and wish that every dog could experience how fun it is to live and work on a farm with a family that loves them. Hell as a kid my dad and I lived on several acres and my dog's got to come and go as they please. During the day we would explore the woods or run in the cow fields till we passed out and at night they would come in if they wanted, which specifically for my case was 99% of the time. But if you have a fantastic setup for your dog outside with shelter, ample toys, love, interaction, and bonding time then I have zero complaints whatsoever cause just like people every dog is different and wants different things. Some dogs want to be inside some dogs love being outside. But the cases that I'm describing are just not that.. the dogs don't have that choice and their owners just straight up don't interact with them or provide anything for their dogs. 

And yes people who keep their dogs inside 24/7 are in the exact same boat as people who just shove them outside and forget about them. Dogs have dynamic needs and when you adopt one you agree to give that to them to the best of your ability.

Also for the people who say this is a popular opinion well it doesn't feel like it cause right now IRL it feels unpopular. Its confirmed happening to 4 different dogs around me as you read this. I made this in the heat of the moment after I was done playing with one of the dogs through the fence just for it to be beat and screamed at once I had to go inside and stop giving it attention. This poor baby just wants positive interaction and possibly just to experience AC when it's 90 degrees outside.",0

Accused rapists should have the same anonymity as rape victims until proven guilty.,17877,1215,2019-01-11 04:15:48,"With the difficulty in proving rape cases due to evidence being largely testimonial, many accused rapists are judged in the public eye rather than the courts. As the basis of the law is innocent until proven guilty and lived can be ruined based upon false accusations, defendants should remain nameless unless it's in the public interest. 

Naming accused brings few benefits besides other victims/witnesses potentially coming forward and warning the public while the trial is under way. Obviously due to the nature of the crime, each cases is different and exceptions will apply. However with many details of trials hidden, the general public tends to make their decision if the accused is guilty based upon very little evidence. This can essentially amount to mob rule even if they are eventually proven innocent, reputations can be irreparable. ",0
The guy who left his girlfriend because he found she got gangbanged before being together was absolutely justified.,17870,3662,2020-04-05 01:47:47,"This image was making the rounds a few months ago. A Screenshot of a 4chan thread where the guy said he broke up with his girlfriend of 4 years after he found out she participated in a gangbang (and admitted she loved it). The image went viral in a lot of fb pages and a bunch of people were in outrage about how ""the mysognist broke the girl's heart"".

These people have a mindset where there is no middle ground, ever. Its all black or white. 

So with this mindset, these people started calling him MYSOGINIST because apparently ""he's a hypocrite! He probably had sex with a lot of girls too! Lol he wanted a virgin!"" as if having sex with 4  people was the same as having sex with 4 people AT THE SAME TIME.
A lot were also saying that ""lol well he must be really boring in bed! Probably only does missionary why keep a man like that?"" again as if not wanting to participate in a gangbang means that you only have sex in missionary.

His position was justified, a gangbang is easily an extreme in terms of sexual acts, and for a lot of people it can be a sign that you either have really poor restrain, judgment skills and that you're potentially more likely to cheat. The guy isn't a ""prude"" for not liking the idea of his girlfriend riding 4 cocks at once and neither does it indicates that he only enjoys the most vanilla of sex.

Pro-life people believe that a fetus is alive, and aborting it is akin to murder, they don't see a difference between aborting a 2 month old fetus and killing a just born baby. So repeating the same lines at them over and over again with the assumption they agree a fetus isn't its own being with its own rights is just going to piss them off.

Mega huge boobs are NOT attractive at all.,17830,1712,2020-04-08 18:13:24,"A K cup is the limit of attractiveness(especially in animations or hentai). I've seen a lot of hentai depicting women with ENORMOUS boobs, sometimes even bigger than their body. THAT is unattractive and sometimes ugly.

Reddit *NEEDS* to Give us the Option of Making our Posting History Private,17810,2069,2019-12-18 06:12:04,"There is absolutely nothing more insufferable/miserable than when I see an interaction like this happen on Reddit.

Person 1:  Posts question/response.

Person 2:  \*\*\*\*WOW!\*\*\*\*  Look at this guy who said opinion X on subreddit Y!!!!  Don't take him seriously.  Not worth our time.

Even if Person 1 really has posted something awful on a shady subreddit, Person 2 will ALWAYS be more pathetic than Person 1 for attacking their character or opinion on a separate thread instead of trying to directly address the claim made in their argument.

Not only this, but I also notice that whenever something like this is done, the Person 2 always goes to downvote every recent post/comment that Person 1 has made.  Person 2 is legitimately just a toxic human being who hates that someone holds an opinion she/he disagrees with.  Even if they don't do this personally, the fact that they have doxxed Person 1's post history attracts others to read it and downvote it too.

I'm not someone who uses Reddit a lot, and I don't have a controversial post history myself.  I've never even had this criticism ever thrown at me, in fact.  But people like Person 2 are just so cringeworthy and sad.  We need to take away the tool that they use to bully and harass people.  They can leave their post history on all they want, but I should have the right to deprive them of stalking me.  That should be my basic right.

I realize many of you will view this as a political issue, as social outrage tends to be used disproportionately to harass those right of center, but I seriously believe a privacy system like this would make us ALL better off, regardless of political ideology.  

Just deal with people on the content of their current thread and ideas, stop trying to dig up the past and dox them.  it's pathetic.  This would make everyone behave in a more civil/intellectual way, and make Reddit a better place for \*everyone\*.",0

"When you censor alternative views, you hurt your own cause",17775,2393,2020-07-01 19:56:14,"This applies to social media and especially to news media.

We get it, you have your opinion. But being biased makes people trust you less, even if you think you are on the good side. Give a fair account and people will make up their minds on what the good ideas are and what the bad ideas are. Give a one-sided account and people will doubt everything you say. 

Censorship only ‘works’ if what you are censoring never gets out. But we are in the year 2020 and we have internet. Besides, burning books only makes them more popular.

Present the news. Present the other side. When you inoculate yourself from other views you weaken your ability to fully understand what is going on in society and the life of the average person. Present those views you dislike and challenge them. You might learn something, and when you force yourself to confront them you’ll even be able to sharpen your arguments against them. But banish them to the shadow realm and they’ll haunt you. You can’t fight an enemy that you pretend either doesn’t exist or is so irrational that they aren’t worth thinking about.",0

SpongeBob is a being with monstrous power and is hiding his true identity,17584,629,2020-10-15 22:40:02,"SpongeBob’s combat capabilities and raw power are seemingly immeasurable and unbelievably powerful. 

SpongeBob has the ability to absorb, reflect, and deflect any physical damage. He also has the ability to sever his own limbs and instantaneously regenerate his cells. He possesses the ability to change the configuration of his body so he could expand his body significantly or become microscopic.

There is a scene where SpongeBob is shown to be sleeping inside of the sun unfazed and the core temperature of the sun is 15 million Celsius. This means that SpongeBob is at least 4383x stronger than tungsten as its melting point is 3422 Celsius. 

SpongeBob is also shown to unravel the string of the universe itself. With the current evidence, SpongeBob is made of some foreign material that is compatible and able to edit the structure of any conceivable element in the whole universe, and is seemingly invincible being able to withstand the sun and only take damage from himself but shows instantaneous regeneration. 

The shape shifting ability of spongebob has not been put to trial as of yet however his instantaneous regeneration could prove him to create enough mass to cover the universe. 

It is also referenced that SpongeBob has connections with other dimensions. SpongeBob even brought a two dimensional being into a three dimensional realm with his godly powers. 

To put it simply, SpongeBob has immeasurable power. He can reconfigure or suffocate the universe if he wanted, and he is seemingly invincible. He is essentially a deity. His regeneration has not been leveled, so in theory he could regenerate his cell mass faster than the expansion of the universe. SpongeBob’s true potential power is seemingly unlimited based on this evidence. 

I have come to the conclusion that SpongeBob is actually the god of Bikini Bottom. It seems that he has created Bikini Bottom for recreational uses or he has been reincarnated from a previous life where he is patiently waiting to attain his full power to crush the world. 

“SpongeBob Squarepants” is genuinely a monster absorbing the life energy of the universe preparing to crush the universe and has taken the form of a sponge, concealing his true identity, to prevent fighting not at his full power. Do not be surprised when SpongeBob destroys the entire multi-verse when he recovers enough energy to reset reality by expanding his sponginess or creating a hypernova large enough to collapse reality itself.

Some of Spongebob’s Notable Feats:

Unraveled the Galaxy

Took a nap within the sun

Fought multiple times and in a war 
 
Can use his body to create weapons of mass destruction 

Master of art as shown when he created a sculpture in three seconds with a pickaxe and created a perfect circle 

Potentially invincible 

Incredible Regenerative and shape shifting abilities

Laughs at pain

Master of Karate

Excellent music teacher

Essentially a Jack of all trades

Infinite lifespan as shown when Squidward travels 2000 years forward and Spongebob is still alive

Also, it’s just an inconvenience realistically. People can literally just have sex then one of them can sell them a water bottle for whatever price they want. You can switch the order if you want.

I don’t wanna be uncomfortable at work or make a scene, so I just go along with conversation when they start it. I don’t think that’s fake.

American Football is overly hyped and boring,17437,2001,2020-06-11 04:37:37,"The average football game lasts 3+ hours with an average of just 11 minutes of actual play. I am thoroughly confused as to how this is the most popular sport in the US. I realize that there is a history and a past culture of football in America which I think is a big factor as to why it’s so popular. I also recognize the skill &amp; speed needed to be good at the sport and while I do enjoy playing it, I can’t bear to watch it. Even when there is action and someone makes a sick play, FLAG, doesnt count. 

Compare it with other “free-flowing” sports such as Hockey, Soccer &amp; Basketball which have minimal stoppages compared to amount of gameplay and I’m baffled as to how more people aren’t into these sports. Sure Soccer can be boring at times, Basketball can be repetitive however I’ll take repetition over lack of actual play. 

I tried to get into Football this past year and while Fantasy is incredibly fun in the sense of having a stake in the game, I just cant sit there and watch drives that consist of 5-6 plays over 10+ minutes, with nobody scoring most of the time. Maybe I’m biased in the sense that other sports have actual goals that you need to put an object into whereas football’s goal is just trying to run or throw a ball into a specific zone on the field. I do think the hitting is fun to watch but take a sport like Hockey. People give it so much shit but in my opinion, it takes the more skill than most sports. You have grown men fighting over a 3 inch disk while traveling upwards of 20 mph on a metal blade. You need the ability to shoot over 85 mph and thread the needle. Its gritty, fast paced, exciting and talent driven. It requires a vast amount of teamwork, awareness and tactics. I feel like most sports fans who don’t enjoy these sports also don’t appreciate the art of them and a really wish more did. That is all 


Edit: I just realized this exact opinion was posted 2 days ago and has probably been posted a million times in this subreddit. Sorry!

Edit 2: For all those saying “soccer is more boring” I agree at times and I literally said that in the post. The point of this post was that if I’m going to invest 3 hours in watching a game, 11 minutes of gameplay is unacceptable. Between the constant ads and replays it is simply unwatchable. Soccer may be boring but at least you get what you pay for. You get to watch the sport you signed up to watch. Also a lot of you need to recheck which sub you’re on because this is my OPINION its ok for us not to like the same things!

"Hunting for food, if done right, is perfectly ethical and there is nothing wrong with hunting down and killing an animal",17324,2253,2020-08-28 09:04:53,"My uncle takes me hunting sometimes and I love it. The thrill of shooting an elk and then eating it's meat is amazing. Some people say it's wrong and unethical, but I completely disagree, here's why:

1) **the animal, unless a predator, probably would have gotten mauled and killed by some other predator such as a wolf or bear if you had not shot it**.
When you shoot an animal such as a buck, if you hit it right it will be dead within a couple minutes or seconds, sometimes the adrenaline it gets causes it to feel no pain. Compare that to it being mauled to death by some other animal and honestly, being shot by a hunter isn't that bad.

2) **only hunt for grown males, not females or children**. If you kill a child animal, you've cut it's life way shorter than it should have been and it doesn't even supply that much meat. If you kill a female, You've just cut down the species from repopulating by a little bit, and that female could've potentially had kids nearby that now have to survive without a mother. Pretty fucked up and unethical. Only shoot grown males

3) **hunting provides food**.  Don't hunt for sport, that's just a huge dick move. Hunting is for providing food for yourself/your family. A deer will have enough meat to last a very long time, and it's natural, nobody fed that animal drugs to fatten it up. If you have never tried natural animal meet, hunted from the woods as opposed to steak you buy from the store which has been farmed from a cow who they probably fed a bunch of drugs to fatten it up, than you need to try it asap.

If a woman hits a man, he has every right to hit her back or take the high road if he prefers but should not feel obligated to do so. 

EDIT: I absolutely do not condone violence against anyone and I find the comments advocating for violence against women appalling to say the least. I’m just annoyed by the double standards when it comes to physical assault and fighting back. Also, I don’t believe it’s mainly due to the size difference as some people claim.

Reading your child's texts is a gross invasion of privacy.,17101,1505,2019-11-30 02:22:41,"Don't get me wrong, if I am a parent and I'm seriously suspicious that my child is doing something that could endanger themselves or others, looking through their phone is obviously an option that makes sense to get the answers you need.

But parents who flip their shit at teenagers for simply not telling them something, or perhaps just not being entirely truthful; and punish them by taking away their phone and reading all their private conversations, is just crazy to me.

Obviously I feel like age should play a factor in this conversation as well.  If your child is say 15 years old+, chances are they probably have some conversations they don't want you to know.  Sometimes people are afraid to tell their parents something, so they find asylum in a friend, and vise versa.  Perhaps they had some experience that they would rather not share with you.  There is literally an abundance of reasons why a teenager might not want their parents to go through their texts.  Not to mention the fact that constantly looming that threat over your child, just leads them to lie more, and be way more secretive.

I also hate the mantra of ""it's my child, it's my business"".  Are you trying to develop a strong independent young adult? Or are you just trying to hold onto that feeling of superiority from their childhood you so desperately don't want to let go.

What pisses me off the most however, is how parents seem to lack empathy from their high school years.  Most of the boomers who are now parents of High school/College kids, didn't have text growing up.  It would be the equivalent of having your mom bug your room when you have friends over after school.  Having your mom listen to all the times you talked about boys, and who likes who, and in more dire situations, who needs help.  I just can't imagine growing up and having a totally normal high school experience and then thinking to yourself ""You know what would have made my high school life easier? If I just had no privacy!"".  I feel like the point of parenting is to raise your kid better than you were raised, and this completely negates that logic.

Not to mention the fact that a conversation takes two to tango.  You're not just invading your child's privacy (which i suppose you have jurisdiction over) you are invading the privacy of whoever was talking to your child.  This not only is incredibly shitty for the other person, but also discourages them from wanting to remain in contact with your child, out of fear that their messages could be used against them.  And nobody wants their kid to have no friends to talk to.

Edit: Yes I am aware that most high school parents are probably Gen X and not boomer, that shouldn't effect my point though.  Also people are asking my age?  I don't think it particularly matters, I'd rather have my argument critiqued on its actual merit.  Not to mention, anyone who has been a kid can have an opinion on this issue, given they make up half of the entire relationship in question.",0

I am trying to respond to all the comments but it's hard to keep up! Please bear with me! I can't believe how popular I have suddenly become! This has literally changed my life forever! My name has been etched in the anals of history for all eternity as one of the greatest thinkers of all-time!!! You're welcome. 

Now, to further elaborate on my original single sentence comment that other people happened to find relatable, it is my opinion that people should definitely not edit their popular comments just to add a wall of text that further elaborates on the point that they already made in a succinct relatable way. The risk of an overly redundant word salad that dilutes the original point of the comment is 100%. Instead, just keep it the way it originally started. Otherwise you'll end up rambling for no reason, which will likely just weaken your comment, and you'll just end up repeating yourself.",0
Having divorced parents who are happier separate is much better than living in a toxic house with both of them together,17080,707,2019-12-31 21:27:03,"People who say they’re together “for their kids” and then continue to provide those same kids with the shittiest environment... wyd? No one wants to hear their parents fighting and yelling at each other every day. It makes me wonder if you’re together to provide your kids with a good life or just cuz y’all are incapable of leaving your toxic relationship?

EDIT: for y’all saying this isn’t an unpopular opinion, you’d be surprised how divorce is taboo in MANY cultures. Coming from one myself, I can say that many, many parents choose to stay together solely to provide their kids with a “good life”. Mental health is often treated like a joke in these cultures as well and so the child receives no form of support in trying undo the damage done to them in the crucial years of their childhood. This is def an unpopular opinion and I’m sure a lot of you can relate!",0

"Journalism is no longer and honest and legitimate profession, and should be treated as such.",17061,2747,2019-08-06 21:41:56,"Granted, I know historically journalists have had their share of ""yellow journalism"" and other poor moments.

Consider how many reputations the media has tarnished in their crusade for a headline. Consider how many ""scares"" we've had because journalists take one potentially interesting tidbit from a story or a study or something and twist and twist until its a big fucking deal, when it really should have been treated as the molehill it was.

Journalism is just activism in sheep's clothing. Why? Because juicy stories sell to the masses. Journalists should be treated with the same skepticism nowadays as used car salesmen, and perhaps more so. 

We need to stop pretending that journalism is about truth -- its not. Its about stirring the pot, riling emotions, getting a reaction out of the public. Not a single one should be trusted; assume all journalists are inherently predatory or ignorant, or both.",0

Movies are better with subtitles.,17019,1068,2019-01-02 00:28:40,"I know what you’re all thinking, “oh my god he likes subtitles? he probably supports dog fighting too!”

Yes I like subtitles. They are minimally intrusive and allow for a better understanding of he dialogue.

If I miss something a character says, I have to rewind and listen again. Potentially twice. If I think I heard them correctly, but am still not sure? I have to listen again!

With subtitles, I never worry about this struggle. I always know exactly what they said. I’ve always been a big fan of well done character development, and dialogue is central to that.

**Tl;dr- Subtitles improve movie quality due to enhanced understanding and ease of comprehension**",0

A lot of discussions are getting redundant because you cannot discuss anything now before someone pointing out one aspect of any associated privilege. People are 'apologizing' for privilege they have under the circumstances they have no control whatsoever. (Their birth, race, country of origin, etc.)

Edit: Okay this blew up. The best thing? r/fragilewhiteredditor made a post on this. Bro, I am not white, a teenager or even anyway near America. Not everything is about white vs black yo.

Some things:
1. Someone cannot have the benefit of absolute privilege in all aspects of life. We are a sum of a lot many factors, some beyond our control.  While it is basic that anyone would benefit from these 'undue' advantages it is also entirely possible that the same person would suffer in some other prospect of life. The world is not binary.

2. My main concern with this discussion is not the acceptance part. We do need to recognize our privilege and how it can be used for the benefit of ourselves and others. What the problem is: people downplaying others because of an associated factor that is deemed as a privilege to them.

3. Instead of recognizing the issue, the concept of privilege is somewhat aimed at decreasing the credibility of the person itself.",0

Then when mommies done with her wine, she’ll come and serve me a lawsuit because her dumb shit kid drowned in a pool he SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN.

"""TheFutureIsFemale"" hashtag is anti-equality.",16635,2762,2020-07-04 15:24:30,"Now, I understand that it is meant to empower women which is great, however it is contra productive when striving for an equalitarian society. Since exchanging the last word to many others (Male, American, ForTheRich, etc.) would make it controversial, the statement in its current form should be no different.

Claiming that ""men have been in control forever, now it's time for women"" is not striving for equality, it is about completely tipping the scales in another groups favor, which will in no way secure an equal opportunity. Instead it is likely to shift the oppression upon the oppressors, in the longer run maintaining the status quo only with sides switched.

I just want to point out, since it is the internet and people will misinterpret you if they can/want to, that I do believe that there are inequalities between men and women in many areas and that this is something we should fix asap! However, I do not believe that we can do so by claiming the future to ""be female"", just as it would not be right for it to ""be male"". Instead we should strive for it to ""be equal"".

Edit: there have been some very good arguments in this thread but the majority of answers are really bad, and not in that people have a different opinion than me, I am okay with that as has already been stated in the original post. But I think I need to clarify some things:

**- I am not a U.S.-citizen, nor do I live in the U.S.A.**
In the country where I do live I have seen this hashtag been used as a way to ""break through the noise"" along with hashtags such as ""YesAllMen"".

**- I am not right wing.**
Jeez, I never thought you Americans really thought the other side were the literal devil until now. When I have brought up issues with the right on other forums I hear that I am a ""snowflake"", ""libtard"", ""commie"", ""socialist"", ""feminazi"", etc. And when I raise an issue regarding *one* hashtag I get a message board smacked full of responses from people calling me ""right wing"", ""sexist"", ""bigot"", that I should ""fxxk off"".

**- I now understand why there is such conflict regarding politics in the U.S.A.**
Some of you people are civil and contribute to the discussion, but many of you are slandering me as well as the other side while looking like complete jerks. Listen: I know it is hard to understand but you *don't* have the constant moral high ground, regardless if you are left, centrist, or right wing. You will learn more, and have a bigger chance at changing minds if you have civilized discussions, talk, and really listen to people with different opinions than your own. It doesn't mean you must tolerate any stupid thing they throw your way, you're free to stop listening and walk away, but just instantly referring to someone who disagrees with you as a bigoted ass isn't gonna make the world a better place for anyone.

**- Stop with the generalizing!**
Not all feminists are extremists who want to ""kill all men"", actually it's probably 2-5 %, but those are the ones you tend to hear about in your echo chambers. Stop that incel bs!

Not everyone who disagrees with your leftist opinion are bigoted, racist, sexist, Nazis, actually it's probably 2-5 %, but those are the ones you hear about in your echo chambers. Stop that victimizing bs!

The public opinion always changes and the public never really “knows” what they want. Sounds like a recipe for disaster

By mass I don’t necessarily mean majority. Why do we do large quick changes in opinion or structure without any regard to potential consequences because groups of people are angry.

Unattractive people should learn to accept that they’re not attractive rather than delude themselves that they are.,16449,3205,2019-06-19 20:58:09,"“Everybody is beautiful to somebody.”

These quotes amongst many others are constantly fed to unattractive people. It’s like everyone needs to believe they’re attractive or else. God forbid anyone ever see themselves as less-than-beautiful. 

But... why? Is being unattractive THAT bad? Is attractiveness a person’s only value to humanity? Are the lies necessary?

Sure, in a utopia, everybody would be attractive to everybody and no one would be considered ugly. But alas, this is planet earth and life isn’t fair. Some people are born with attractive features; some are not. Some are born with blatantly unattractive features. Yes, that’s nobody’s fault, but that’s just the way it is. 

Before you say “beauty is subjective”, you can’t deny that certain features are innately and universally attractive to human beings. For men they would be tall height, broad shoulders, full hair, clear skin, and facial symmetry+harmony. For women: clear skin, full hair, hairlessness, facial symmetry+harmony, and a good waist-hip ratio. Aside from certain fetishists, I’ve yet to meet a man or woman who did not strongly prefer these features and dislike their opposites. 

Not only would people stop lying to themselves if they accepted their unattractiveness; they would no longer have to wonder “what am I doing wrong?” when they find that others don’t view them how they view themselves.",0

Edit: I was referencing an article that appeared on the popular page of Reddit yesterday. For those asking, I do not have the link but perhaps somebody else saw it has easy access to it. I am not claiming that people engaging in politics have mental issues.

The blowjob scenes in porn videos get way too much screen time.,16386,1160,2020-04-16 17:46:14,"First comes the “story” to let you know what the situation is, then the next 50% of the video is bj’s followed by a few different positions that don’t get enough time, and finally the cumshot. 

Some positions aren’t even always included. If they’re going to show the blowjob every time (which I always skip through because ew), they should include the other main positions for an equal or almost equal amount of time. Missionary (boy on top), doggy (and please a full view and not just the dick and ass), cowgirl (knees or squat), and reverse cowgirl.

Pineapple on pizza isn't even slightly weird. Sweet and savory is one of the most common and proven food combinations.

Applying modern morality to historical figures is the dumbest way to acknowledge history,16341,1187,2020-06-21 15:41:21,"(No, this post is not about slave owners, or any single group necessarily. Owning slaves was frowned upon when we did it and even 80 years before the civil war during the founding of the US)

I can’t stand people who think that their understanding of morals and ethics is the universal objective and that everyone else who’s practically ever lived was wrong. To not acknowledge the time and location where a particular act took place is to be willfully ignorant for your own benefit. 

I get that when arguing this specific part of historical analysis, people have an agenda and need to defend their reasoning by insinuating that moral relativism is just a theory and that we, as a perfect human race in all our wisdom can look back on our ancestors and judge their actions from a place of higher being while also not having any idea what their lives were. 

It’s just such a pretentious and unproductive way of debating history

Edit: hey guys, just wanted to add a couple things to specify, and also I want to thank everyone for participating, as I think this is a discussion that we need to have over and over again to stay cognizant of how we approach history and the people we choose to venerate.

With that said, a lot of questions here were about giving specific examples. I’d like to point to Genghis Khan, who we almost universally refer to as a genocidal rapist at this point. However, he built the Mongolian Empire out of the scattered and poor steppe tribes that various empires and the Chin Dynasty has been subjugating for years. The tribes would be turned on each other into major wars to keep them weak and docile, and life was hard for every Mongolian. Genghis Khan’s story of how he rose to power is amazing, you should read it sometime, but basically he was just tired of being stepped on by everyone else, and many mongols felt the same. This caused them to unite the tribes, rise up, and overthrow pretty much the entire eastern world at the time. To a Mongolian, the Khan would have been considered a grassroots leader with conviction who fought the uber-wealthy Chin overlords and made Mongolia the center of power in Asia. He’s be referred to as a god, and is still viewed locally in a similar manner. But to us in the west, we see our own historical record which heavily criticized the Mongols for being pagan, and an unstoppable force of genocidal maniacs. I’m not saying they weren’t, but I certainly don’t think we can explain Genghis Khan’s actions and rationale as “he was pure evil” or “he was a psychopath” because that ignores the almost infinite nuances that made him do everything he did. Ignoring those nuances means that what we’re learning about him and consequently, ourselves, is inherently flawed, and we need to overcome that by acknowledging our own biases.

Also, I’m not saying you can’t view historical actions with your own morals. But you do need to acknowledge that doing so creates a false narrative that can be dangerous. To go with my earlier example, if someone just assumes that Genghis Khan was pure evil because of all the things he did and uses that to judge him against modern morals, that person ignores the actual events that caused him to do such reprehensible things; these events could have caused anyone to do exactly what the Khan did. Basically, it’s not enough to understand the end result. We need to know how we got there first. How did regular people in Germany at the beginning of WW2 get drawn into Nazism? We know how it ended but how it started is often glossed over and we lose the reasons why something happened, and only promise ourselves that we won’t do that thing again. That’s a tough sell for me.",0
Nurses should not be allowed to wear white coats in the hospital,16343,4381,2020-05-20 07:40:49," 

In recent years, in the US, a large proportion of nurses have been trying to blur the lines and confuse patients as to what their actual role is in healthcare settings. Nurses are not doctors. On average, doctors receive 21,000 hours of training before they are allowed to practice medicine, whereas someone with a Doctorate in Nursing is required to complete 1,000 training hours to graduate. 

American nurses have been lobbying to gain the right to treat patients autonomously without the supervision of physicians, despite being under-qualified and inadequately trained for independent practice. There are nurses who received online nursing doctoral degrees who call themselves “doctor” in healthcare settings even though they are not physicians. As stated in the title, many nurses have also started wearing white coats in the hospital to give the impression of being doctors. 

If you want to be a doctor, go to medical school. Put in the time, take on the debt, and do things the right way instead of trying to deceive patients into thinking you are something you are not.",0
"Severely morbidly handicapped/deformed babies are not ""miracle gifts from God"". They are genetic glitches that are meant to die peacefully",16338,1076,2020-02-06 07:19:50," By  ""severely morbidly deformed/handicapped"" I mean things like  anencephaly, holoproencephaly, etc. I mean those deformities or levels  of handicap that completely erase quality of life from existence. Cases  like Jaxon Buell, Claire and Lola Hartley, Baby Faith-Hope etc. Turns  out there's an entire portion of the disability blogosphere centered  around these complete no-hope cases where the kid is born with the type  of deformity that ensures they will NEVER have any sort of a life, and  that any time they do have on this Earth will be filled with nonstop  seizures, muscle spasms/contractions, severe problems with every single  body system they have, and therefore unspeakable pain and agony that  they cannot even communicate or comprehend.

And  yet whenever you see one of these cases pop up of a child who really  should not have had its life prolonged to 3, 4, or even *over ten*  years in this condition they're always going on about how the child is  ""an angel,"" this is ""God's will,"" ""heaven sent,"" ""a miracle,"" etc. I  believe in God. This is not God's will nor is it a miracle. It is not  God's will to keep a human being with this level of defect alive for 10  years in that sort of hell. It is not a ""beautiful miracle"" that you now  have a 3-year-old human-shaped pile of basic reflexes and autonomic  functions living a painful existence. It's HELL to put a living being  through that sort of existence just so you can coo on social media about  your precious angel child.

I've  called out parents who do this shit and when I do I always inevitably  get ""How dare you judge. You don't know what you would do in that  mother's shoes."" ""How could you call out such a brave mother who's  living such a nightmare?"" ""How could you possibly say she is a bad  parent with all she does for her child?"" She's a bad parent because she  kept that child alive in its hellish condition because she would rather  keep the child's physical form and play mommy with it (because you know  you can't actually parent a child with that level of deformity. It  doesn't even know you are its mommy or that it's a child, it just knows  ""breathing"" ""hungry"" and ""need to poop"") than allow nature to take its  course and let it rest (I don't mean leaving it on a mountain to die  somewhere. I mean pallative care in a facility or in a hospital until  the inevitable happens). And yes, I do know what I'd do in her shoes.  I'd do WHAT IS BEST FOR THE WRETCHING, TWITCHING PILE OF AGONY AND  SUFFERING that just came out of me and have it placed in a pallative  care facility where it will be kept as comfortable as humanly possible  until the inevitable takes place. And I would mourn and grieve for the  rest of my life, but I would understand that it would be selfish for me  to keep that child alive in that condition just because I want to have  it around. Because motherhood is about what is best for the child, not  for you.

Your average Joe doesn't have to reduce his carbon footprint and aid against climate change until big corporations and governments start trying.,16165,841,2020-05-27 02:19:07,"Pretty much, the average person's attempts to minimize their effect on climate change is a very valiant cause, but will do nothing in the long-run until corporations and governments own up to their shortcomings and do something about it. Governments burning fossil fuels and corporations dumping trash into the oceans and not doing anything to reduce their carbon footprints is going to be the last straw for humans. If we continue like this, then climate change is in my opinion going to be the one that kills a majority of the population. The quote, ""A chain is only as strong as its weakest link"" really applies here. It's great that people do their bit in helping, but until governments and companies do something, the world will continue in the downward spiral that it's on. Until governments start use renewable energy instead of coal or corporations reduce their carbon footprint, you or I don't have to do anything because our small contribution won't really change anything.

Yeah, a person taking a shorter shower and riding a bike is for a great cause and should be supported, but it means close to nothing. Big businesses and governments have to own up and need to make huge efforts to remedy climate change.

Edit: So I see a lot of people saying that the Average Joe's job is to vote for candidates that have a policy like that. I absolutely agree! You guys have actually changed my opinion a little, but I still think that it should be the government/potential candidate and corporations that take the initiative.

You're letting them learn eating habits that are going to cause them to likely be fat their entire life, putting them at a higher risk for a long list of serious health issues. 

Edit: I'm gonna try and address some reoccurring comments here. 

I understand that (at least in the States) a lot of the time it is cheaper to buy junk food, but this isn't a good argument because you can still lose weight with junkfood. For the overwhelming majority of people weight loss comes down to calories in being fewer than calories out. 


And on taking kids away from parents I agree there should be some steps before that happens. There should be serious health impacts before this happens, and some kind of intervention in the form of a diet/exercise plan given to the family to follow. But if you're gonna let your kid get diabetes at 16 then yea, they should be taken away.

I’ve watched many episodes of this show and frankly it’s cringe to watch. Sure, the acts that come on and make it through do have a talent, but the basis of the show is who has the saddest backstory, who is the most disabled, who’s the poorest, and who is the biggest victim. Each contestant profile eventually goes into this sad piano riff and black/white film of them staring out at something while they highlight why we should feel sorry for them.

It is what drives their marketing, it’s the headline of every clip that comes off that show. Every title is something clickbaity like “the judges thought she would suck because she’s fat and blind, but what she does next will leave you STUNNED”.

Another thing, a large portion of the contestants aren’t American, they always bring in some dance crew or something from a very poor country to “wow” us. They may as well drop the “America” from the name.

This show is a non-stop sap story with singing and dancing and magic sometimes. They might as well just say at the finals “well contestant X, you are very fat and blind, from a poor neighbourhood, and we’re bullied, but contestant Y is just a bit more fat and blind, and from a slightly poorer neighbourhood, and I think she’s gay, so she wins!”

Judging people by their looks works well for the vast majority of cases.,15955,2157,2019-08-05 21:00:08,"So here's the thing: Looks are not something that just randomly fell into place or whatever, but they are to a large part the result of choices and efforts made. For example, if you are well kept and wear a professional outfit, you're probably someone that cares a lot about impressions and your career, and most likely you have a fairly conservative outlook on life. Equally, if you look like a stoner or like you don't care about your looks, then that also says something about your values and beliefs. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, but it's just obvious. If you are a woman, cut your hair short, and dye it three different colors, it's also not too hard to guess your political leanings. Same for someone running around in polo shirts and boat shoes only.

""I'm creating jobs! Im keeping people afloat with my payments!""

You lost. 

You lost money, you lost time. 

Because honestly, you're most likely just masturbating and you can do that not only with free porn, but also without porn at all. Yep. So, to conclude, if you pay for porn you are a loser. 

What's another argument? The videos are higher quality and more professional? That's interesting. So is your imagination if you know how to use it. 

You can spend your time arguing with me that paying for porn doesn't make you a loser, but really, do YOU pay for porn? Or are you just defending those who do? If the case is the latter, then you have little say in this argument. If you do pay for porn and you would like to make a counter-argument to my opinion, maybe that would be better use of your time then watching porn, and if it's not and you prefer to watch porn instead of arguing, then go ahead and open PornHub premium and forget about Reddit.",0

I hate how being rude is now normalized in social media,15827,524,2020-09-07 22:19:49,"Most of you might already seen or heard about this topic, but here is my take.

I noticed that more and more people, especially influencers, are posting content showing themselves just being straight up a-holes to random strangers and pass it off as a *savage* prank.

This has led to many of their followers to follow in their footsteps to be more *savage*. This usually ends up in them being rude to others, just to get a laugh.

I know I sound like a cranky old fart by saying this, but this has gone too far. Many of these followers might just be kids and grow up to be such jerks, and they will probably get away with it if they pass it off as content for their Instagram.

It's understandable why people still identify to certain racial/ethnic groups as most are raised/conditioned to do so, however, at its core it's a primitive social paradigm that only causes more problems than it solves.   


Identities that are racially blind are far more useful in connecting people to each other regardless of ethnic/racial background. For example: Hogwarts club: which house do you belong to?

Sending food to countries that can’t feed themselves only makes the problem worse. The root of the problem is these people can’t feed themselves. Feeding them only allows them to keep reproducing, creating even more mouths that can’t be fed. Either teach these people to farm or let them starve. If they aren’t capable of farming, survival of the fittest. 

Parts of Africa are like the crazy cat lady. She sees a few starving cats and thinks this is horrible, so she feeds them. Pretty soon they reproduce and she has even more cats to feed. What started out as a few starving cats turns into 50 starving cats. She hasn’t solved a problem she just made it worse. She had good intentions but didn’t stop cats from starving, she just created more starving cats.

Edit: If you suffer from mental illness that is difficult to control, don’t be afraid to reach out for help. Most health departments offer low to no cost behavioral health treatment. Find your triggers and learn to recognize your warning signs. Be assertive when you know you’re getting overwhelmed so you can leave a situation. 

And don’t forget to forgive yourself. This is the most important part. We are human and we fuck up regardless of the status of our mental health. Everyone has their own issues and struggles. Self help books and videos are easy to find and help out so much if you’re unable to get access to therapy.

Edit 2: Don’t take things out of context. You are allowed to not get treatment for your mental illness, but if you are doing that, you can’t expect people to stay by your side while you belittle them and blame it on your mental illness. No where did I say that you HAVE to get treatment. 

My BPD is untreated because I feel that I have a good bit of control over it. I have had one outburst in 3 years and IMMEDIATELY apologized to everyone involved, even if they were not targeted.

Airpods are extremely overrated.,15381,2976,2019-12-26 20:29:01,"Just think about it. What was wrong with wired headphones?

They also always made me feel bit more relaxed because as long as I heard the music I knew I hadn't lost my phone. And on top of it all you don't have to charge them. 

And then came the airpods. Not only are they way too overpriced but they seem just so inconvenient. Who guarantees that they'll fit in your ear perfectly without falling out? What do you do if you loose one? And you have to charge them every couple of hours. And they don't even look that good.

Toxic Femininity is worse than Toxic Masculinity,15273,4894,2019-08-12 18:39:05,"In recent years we have seen a rise in complaints relating to the behaviour of men and how it can be construed as toxic. The current movements have brought a deeper focus towards this and have created changes, some for the better and some for the worse. But during this time the very people marching against man have completely ignored their own toxic behaviours and a failure to address these would be worry some. Women seem to want equality, but do not want to change their own bad behaviours.

When you think of toxic masculinity you are primarily speaking about mansplaining, manspreading, sexual violence or the boys will be boys argument. The whole movements seems to target the role of men as the dominant sex.

&#x200B;

But when you look at toxic femininity there is a much wider scope of problems that show up. A lot of toxic behaviours can easily outweigh most of what these people consider to be toxic masculinity. A few examples being;

* Blaming behavioural issues on periods
* Acting helpless at times where some physically demanding or unpleasant task comes up
* Coercing men into sex who didn't seem to really want it and feeling as though you were at liberty to do so because ""men always want it""
* Backed up by studies, women are far more likely to threaten harm to themselves, others or property if a man attempts to leave a relationship
* Being physically abusive to men while expressing ""men can't hit women"" and being less likely to face any legal consequences for doing so
* Lying about pregnancies or being on birth control to see how a man would respond or to manipulate them into staying
* Manipulating divorce and custody battles by falsely insisting that a man has been abusive to you or a child.

&#x200B;

Some of these examples are minor toxic offences, like blaming bad behaviour on hormones. It's normal, it happens, but it is no excuse all the same. Some of these examples are major toxic offences. Such as using your gender or children as a weapon to influence decision to go your way.

One of the most common offences of toxic femininity is attempting to convince the world that toxic femininity does not exist.

"If your girlfriend refuses to do something sexually with you that she has willingly done for her previous boyfriend/s, you should break up with her.",15208,5414,2019-06-29 19:22:36,"For the record, I'm not talking about things she tried once with an ex, but never did again because she genuinely didn't like it (although, an argument could be made for her letting you try at least once, too).

What I am talking about is any act she willingly performed for an ex that she either enjoyed or was at least indifferent to (i.e. She had no negative feelings about it).

&#x200B;

There are two main reasons for this behavior and neither of them are good.

&#x200B;

The first reason could be that her ex is more important to her than you. He is so important that even though the relationship is over, there are still things that she wants to reserve as only being for him and, in her mind, giving those things to you would feel like cheating. I know, crazy right?

&#x200B;

The second reason could be that she is less attracted to you than she was to her ex. You are second best in her estimation; good enough to date, but not good enough to give all that she has to offer. Does that sound like a desirable relationship to be in???

&#x200B;

Now, Reddit is filled with easily triggered women and the whitest of knights who have this magical ability to read things that were never typed, so let's make some thing's clear:

&#x200B;

1. No guy is entitled to sex from a girl just because she is his girlfriend, but no girl is entitled to a relationship with a guy she won't fuck.
2. I'm not saying that a guy should say ""Do this for me, or I'm leaving."" I'm saying that, once he finds out that she's holding out on him sexually, he should move on. That relationship is toxic, and you can be sure that sex isn't the only thing she's keeping from him.
3. This obviously goes both ways and pertains to more things than just sex, I only picked men and sex because I tend to hear about that situation more often.
4. Obviously not suggesting that the girl should be forced to do anything she doesn't want to do.
5. If both the guy and the girl are refusing to give each other things that they willingly gave their ex's, then I guess it's a match made in heaven.

Another guy had an ex that wouldn't do anal, but she talked about doing it with an ex and how much she liked it.

"Dear humans: Vanilla is not ""plain"", ""boring"", or ""flavorless"". It *is* a flavor, and a rich one at that.

And it is white, a word often synonymous with ""blank"" or ""empty"". This made kids everywhere assume that vanilla is just the ordinary and boring. But it's not.

It really doesn't help that in the U.S., major food companies are penny-pinching jerks who make cheaper-tasting flavor (and who also ruin people's understanding of ""American cheese"", a cheese which-- when you make it right-- is a good contender with any other flavorful cheeses you see on the shelf every day.) Vanilla was once described in Europe as the ""essence and epitome of flavor"". That's why it became so common. And over time, vanilla was widely substituted with cheaper things. ""Natural vanilla flavor"" isn't vanilla. It's a natural flavor that tastes kinda like it (and often comes from something you don't want to hear about, not that I think there's anything wrong with substitute flavors in general). Real vanilla is fantastic.

"Telling men to not be afraid of a false rape accusation because it's statistically unlikely doesn't help anything, because that's not WHY we are really afraid.",15022,3901,2019-04-29 16:59:59,"Anyone who pays attention to the news, at all, should remember the cluster fuck that was the Kavanaugh hearings. Resulting from that mess was the brief conversation that happened around the interwebs, on the opinion pages of news sites, and probably a good amount of interpersonal conversations as well. 

The conversation went as such: If you're afraid of a false rape accusation landing on you, you're wrong to do so because it's so rare, and you're a shitty person to do so because that means you don't care about women. Furthermore, even men who *are* falsely accused of rape rarely see jail time anyways!

Yeah. No shit. The reason being is that the biggest way to determine if an accusation is false is if there is *undeniable evidence despite the accuser stating otherwise* (which is rare) **OR** *the accuser confesses that the accusation was false* (which is usually the case). So... of course the legal system will not give charges based on a *certifiable false statement.* 

What ISN'T outlined about rape accusations is the majority of them are closed because there is no evidence to support *either* scenario. The implication in providing the ""they're really rare"" statistic was it *implied the remaining allegations were true.* In effect, it was a lie by omission. 

And the above really isn't my point anyways. Here's the main point:

*In a false accusation, the false accuser is rarely punished. There are very little, if any, repercussions to a false female rape accuser if she's found to be lying.*

So, why should a woman be scared to make a false allegation if *his life is going to be fucked up from it and hers isn't, even if she's caught in the lie?* Where's the deterrent there? 

Another question that I have never once seen given a good answer:

How does a man prove verbal, unrecorded consent to sex? This is how *most* consent occurs anyways. Other than his word, what defense does he have to a woman stating that the sex turned into rape? Throw in radical feminism's insistence that consent can be revoked at any time, *even after sex*, then what men are looking at is a fucking legal minefield that has this as a sign at the front of it: Intimacy with a Woman. 

We have no defense, she gets no consequences..... and people are baffled as to why men, especially young men, are terrified of this? 

Lastly: I want to be wrong. 

Here's what you can do if I am: treat me as someone who has been lied to, and **prove why that's the case**, without being a piece of shit about it. try and see if you can avoid calling me an ""incel"" as that is the current insult in this regard I've found. 

I'm not saying this to guard against my delicate sensibilities, but rather know that I am *nowhere close* to being alone here. Relentless condescension, name-calling, and accusations are only going to do one thing with the growing number of men who are convinced they're right: it'll reinforce their position, and you won't even see them in the comments. You won't even see them outside the walls of a public conversation, or a heated exchange on Facebook. Talk to *them,* not *me...* in this case here on Reddit at least.  

So, if I am wrong, convince the people not leaving comments, the ones listening, that I am... and see if you can do it in a way that doesn't make *you* look like part of *another* growing demographic: someone who doesn't even give a shit and could care less about men's concerns and fears.

"If your partner was in a particular shape when you got together, and then completely let themself go during the relationship, no longer being attracted to them is not your fault.",14641,956,2020-01-02 08:21:07,"It's not ""body shaming"" if you no longer find your partner attractive after they put on 50 lbs. 

Meaningful relationships require being attracted to their personality, and not just their body. But all initial contact is based on simple physical attraction.

Just as you dont get to choose who you find attractive, whether it be men or woman, you don't get to choose what physical features you find attractive. Liking a physically fit person is not wrong. Nor is liking more heavy set people.

If your partner puts on weight, stops exercising and makes zero effort to remedy this, all the while you make a concerted effort to stay in shape, you're not the asshole for not ""supporting"" them being fat and unhealthy.

Edit: I'd like to clarify something as I think many of you are misunderstanding my point:

My opinion on this is being applied to a long term, committed relationship. I fully understand and agree that people's weight will fluctuate and don't expect anyone to maintain some ridiculous, unsustainable physique. I'm talking about someone making zero effort to maintain their appearance both for health, and aesthetic reasons. The point that I believe is unpopular is that no one should be vilified or ridiculed for expressing that they find their SO less attractive because they've let themselves go. I'm also NOT advocating shaming, threatening ultimatums, abuse (verbal or physical) or anything else of that nature on the part of either party. I'm advocating for open communication and a willingness from the other party to see the different point of view.

Edit 2: I've very much enjoyed the discussions I've had with the majority of you up to this point. I hope you all know that my responses are not in an argumentative tone. Text is so often misinterpreted as to emotional inflection by the reader. I'm going to bed now and do not look forward to wading through the swamp of hate that will undoubtedly be my inbox tomorrow as I didnt expect this tonget any attention, let alone as much as this. Goodnight to you all. And goodmorning to non Americans just now reading this, if you've gotten this far.

Edit 3: I'd like to clarify another point as some of you seem to be missing this: *Nowhere in this post do I suggest leaving your partner because you're not attracted to them due to weight gain*. This would also apply to old age, balding, illness, whatever. What I AM suggesting is being able to tall about it, openly and without being attacked by your partner, their friends, or the world at large. Open communication may or may not lead to the dissolution of the relationship, but I think in most cases it wouldn't. Ive seen many instances of people justifying their infidelity with the excuse that they no longer found their partner attractive, but st no point was this communicated between the two parties. Theres no excuse for breaking your SOs trust by cheating. Theres no excuse for not talking about it. My opinion here is that you should be able to state that you dont find your partners weight gain appealing and that this should result in open, healthy discussion on the subject. I'm not saying ""leave your partner if they get old or fat"".",0

"Schools need to teach kids about acne, weight gain, showering, and inform them about what conditions we bully people for way more than we need half assed anti-bullying campaigns that do nothing.",14573,745,2019-03-12 09:33:57,"You have no idea how many kids think that acne is just a matter of washing your face or that they're just to lazy to get medication, or even that anything on the face is either acne or herpes. So many kids get bullied for something that 80% of people go through. Acne is almost exclusively caused by hormones, and while washing twice daily (or possibly three if it's extremely greasy) can help *if proper cleaners are used* it won't get rid of it for most people. I had sensitive skin, like extremely sensitive, many people do, and I had tried about 20 different medications and washes and all of them burned until I cried so I was forced to give up, not to mention that was a HUGE expense every month some families might not be able to spare. Different things work for different people, sometimes nothing works. Turns out I didn't even have acne. I have a very common condition called KP, that looks like acne (causes redness, bumps, small ""whiteheads"" that are actually filled with keratin not pus) and has no cure or good treatment other than just growing out of it. Eating different foods has no effect on your acne as long as your overall diet is healthy. If you have good quality make-up it won't cause acne, some are even made to help. I could go on forever about myths that nobody knows, at least not until it's to late for them and those who they may have bullied.

Weight gain for many kids is again not their fault. Their parents aren't providing a healthy diet. These kids essentially have an addiction. The majority of kids who are overweight are eating that way due to stress. Bullying has made them afraid of the gym, locker rooms, gym class, just excersize in genderal. Also many people who may look overweight can be of perfectly fine BMI and extremely healthy. Not saying the fat acceptance ""there's no such thing as obese"" is true, just that what we see isn't always right, and nobody deserves to get bullied for what is more than likely not their fault.

I knew a kid who never showered, it was because nobody taught him how to really scrub his hair or use shampoo, and he was in foster care so nobody taught him. Same went for washing clothes, brushing teeth, using deodorant, while they seem rather evident to most of us, some families can't afford it and some kids simply don't have any family to learn it from. 

All in all, bullying largely comes from lack of knowledge and understanding. I'm pretty sure that if we simply taught kids about their own bodies in a way that went past ""here's how to probably not get a girl pregnant"" and ""this is a vegetable"" we would highly reduce bullying. Did you know the average woman dislikes her breasts and 80% would get surgery? It is beyond normal to have slightly lopsided boobs, to have large areolas, inverted nipples, the ""average"" breast is in no way a perfect. Did you know that the average man isn't capable of getting a six pack, that it is completely normal to have a slight fat buildup in your chest? We often don't talk about the unrealistic body expectations for men, but in no way whatsoever is the average man running around out there with enough muscle deffinition to look like he's made of cobblestone.

We should be realistic with children from a very young age. Say things like, ""You can do so much"", ""The future has so many possibilities for you"", anything else besides the false promise of ""You can be literally anything you want to be""

Healthcare would be more affordable if we didn’t spend so much money on keeping very old people alive,14529,1922,2018-12-27 12:15:22,"I work in a hospital and I see so many obvious hopeless cases in ICU. Many machines, many tests and round a clock care for geriatric patients with failing organs or crippling diseases , etc. Kept alive for weeks at a time, just to die anyways. 

This even goes for “younger” patients. The guy with the chronic liver disease or a drug user. In the “old days” those patients would’ve just died before receiving hundreds of thousands in medical care but now with so much advances in technology, people are kept alive much longer artificially than otherwise would’ve been. But they’re not really alive. You’re just delaying the inevitable at a great cost and disservice to quality of life.

Guys shouldn’t have to “take a hint.” Girls should use their words.,14505,1903,2019-11-26 03:27:39,"I am so sick of talking to girls online/from dating apps and having them feign interest and then get mad at me for continuing to message them.

Don’t follow your passion. Follow the money.,14493,2130,2019-10-12 08:30:06,"Don’t follow your passion. Follow the money and spend it on your passion.

You should focus on something you don't hate, with good financial incentives, good learning opportunities, and in a field that won't be extinct in 5 years.

Money is important, really fucking important. Only the privileged get to ignore the fact.

Update/Opinion #2

For those spouting the “I’d rather be happy following my dream than miserable my entire life following the money”. 

I didn’t get my shit together until I was 31. I became financially independent 7 years ago at the age of 36. I did this by chasing the money. I can now do whatever the fuck I want whenever the fuck I want because I have the time and the capital. 

Make money early, invest, and let compounding do the rest.

Overcast days are EXTREMELY underrated,14448,640,2020-07-12 07:00:42,"Ok so I know SO many people that just LOVE sunny days saying things like, “it’s such a beautiful day!”.

It’s not rude to recline your seat on an airplane,14445,2446,2020-09-23 09:28:50,"I (F28) recently came back from a trip which was a 8 hour non-stop flight. After ascending I reclined my chair. Soon after I heard a woman seated in the row behind me mention that I had some nerve to be so inconsiderate. I paid them no mind as it only goes back 2 goddamn inches and fell asleep. I was only asleep for 45 mins when I woke up to someone repeating “Excuse me ma’am” in my ear. It was the flight attendant asking me if I could lift my seat back up. Now I became irritated because I hate being woken up especially for some BS so I said “Why am I doing something wrong?” She responded “No, it’s just that the ladies behind you are uncomfortable.” 

Our seats were in the front of the plane which was completely full but I knew there were plenty of empty seats further back. I paid extra for the aisle and to have a seat closer to the exit to make getting off quicker. I responded with “Sorry I can’t because then I would be uncomfortable. But if they want more space than you could have them move seats in the back.” The daughter chimes in right away “No we’re not moving my mother is elderly and doesn’t need your seat in her personal space, you have no excuse you’re young and healthy.” 

I didn’t even bother to talk to her instead spoke directly to the flight attendant. “Look I’m not starting any trouble, I’ve had spinal surgery for a herniated disc and have screw in my hip resulting from a car accident. A flight this long causes pain in my lower back and my hip becomes stiff, the reclining helps relieve some of the pressure. The gentleman in front of me has his seat back but I’m not complaining because airplane rides are never comfortable. Even if I was young and healthy I wouldn’t be doing anything I’m not supposed to so please don’t wake me up again.” 

The flight attendant apologized to me and told the women there was nothing wrong with what I was doing but she tried to mediate, then walked off. I looked at the entitled lady who was mouthing off who wasn’t even sitting behind me and said “Anything else you got an issue with?” She scoffed and rolled her eyes. I was proud of myself because 2 years ago, I would’ve caused a scene that would’ve ended up viral. Then I went back to sleep and had a peaceful flight.

Teaching your child how to fight is the only way to stop persistent bullying,14400,1128,2020-02-21 22:22:45,"School policies on anti-bullying measures are an absolute laughable joke. Parents who leave it up to the school to deal with bullying or insist their child tell the school are better off telling their child they will continue to be tormented to hell. Speaking to the parents will generally make things worse, and telling your child to ignore it is just as effective as doing nothing. 

Whether it is wrestling, boxing, BJJ, it doesn't matter, as long as it it's applicable. An adult with fighting experience would demolish an adult without fighting experience, if you have fighting experience as a CHILD you will be untouchable. 

From personal experience, I used to be picked on for reasons that now seem illogical other than kids are mindless in the harm they cause. I was put into wrestling and boxing by force by my father and while I was scared shitless attempting to retaliate, it WORKED, tremendously well even without much experience. The bullying stopped, and the worst part was the bully attempted to befriend me for years after the incident.",0
"Depressed people, please stop being angry that when you're complaining about your mental health to your friends and family they suggest seeing a therapist. That's exactly the advice nonprofessionals should be giving you. Directing you to professionals.",14382,534,2020-08-10 05:02:25,"We get about two dozen posts a day by people with depression/other mental health issues accusing their friends and family of being lazy/uncaring when they direct them to therapy.

Guys, your friends and family are not capable of helping your mental health issues. They are just regular people like you. They should NOT be giving out medical advice, but instead they should be directing you to professionals who can help.

I don't see diabetics on here complaining their friends and family don't give them medical advice about how to handle their diabetes. We don't have cancer patients complaining their friends and family aren't giving them cancer treatment advice. 

Just people with mental health issues complaining they aren't getting free professional level medical advice from people who aren't professionals.

If you want mental health to be considered a serious medical concern, quit working against your own ideals an demanding random people help fix your issues. That isn't their expertise. 

Go see a therapist.

To clarify this post: No. I am not saying don't talk to your friends and family about your issues. Including, or even especially, about your mental health concerns.  I am a massive advocate for communication among the people important to you about any problems in your life. Light on a problem usually helps to fix it. 

What I am talking about is explicitly mental health advice. Advice is a different thing from listening to you vent. Guidance is when a friend or family member who doesn't know what they are doing or has issues or biases can make things a hell of a lot worse. 

If your friends and family are directing you to a therapist, that is the best they can do. They are likely correctly feeling that they don't have the experience to give you advice. The best thing to do is direct you to a professional. 

And I'll tell you what guys. I would be very wary of the advice you get from people who are very confident and cavalier about advising on essential topics they aren't trained in. And mental health is an important topic that shouldn't be taken unseriously.",0

According to the lyrics of this boastful chant, she is willing to offer lessons for making such a milkshake but for a price. Could that mean that the ingredients used to make this milkshake cost more than the labelled price and instead of increasing it to maintain profit, she gives lessons on how to make such a milkshake in order to compensate for her lack of total earnings? Is she that desperate to keep the ALL the boys in her yard!? A low price in exchange for a higher consumer rate, and yet she claims that her milkshakes are better than mine. What if she were to increase the prices, will all the boys still head to the yard cause the milkshake is THAT good?? She even says that her milkshake making techniques ""drive the guys crazy"" and ""freak these boys"". It's unbelievable how one's milkshakes can be judged simply by how it's prepared.

I'm assured that one day, I will be capable of creating ultimate milkshake which brings not only boys, but also girls to my yard.

Are they upset with the Union Jack (The flag of the UK) when they were the ones to set up the colonies and the slave system in the colonies? No, just try to start a fight.

The word “retarded” shouldn’t be offensive,14232,2112,2019-03-13 11:09:13,"The fact that society is shying away from “the r-word” is proof of the so-called euphemism treadmill. Basically, by replacing “retarded” with something else, we’re just kicking the can down the road and it’s a matter of time before the new word becomes offensive. 

Not that long ago, the term “retarded” was considered a kind and politically correct way to replace words like “idiot” and “imbecile” (those were actually medical terms 75 or so years ago). 

The term “special” or “special needs” is probably the most common way of replacing “retarded,” but even those terms are becoming offensive (for example, conservatives sometimes derisively call progressives “special snowflakes”). 

Obviously human decency should prevent us from making fun of those with mental disabilities, but it just isn’t necessary to tip-toe around those clunky terms that become offensive after a few years.

"It should be illegal for a pregnant woman to drink alcohol or smoke cigs while pregnant, and grounds for removal by child services.",14233,1292,2018-10-13 22:28:19,"Some may claim this isn’t unpopular, but I think it is. Bodily autonomy, no one owning a pregnant woman’s body (not even the fetus growing inside of it), the fact that you can’t even file a CPS report for a follow up *after* the birth of a child to a woman who drank like a fish her whole pregnancy, or a woman who delivered prematurely due to their nicotine addiction. 

If you are pregnant and intend on carrying and birthing that child, you have a moral and ethical responsibility to make sure that baby is born as healthy as possible. It should be illegal for any woman to drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes while she’s growing a developing fetus. 

It should be punishable as felony child abuse or neglect if the child is born with any deformities or developmental issues related to the substance abuse (this is provable with medical expertise), and charged as a misdemeanor if not. At the very least, CPS should be allowed to intervene before the child is born, and remove the child upon birth. 

Edit: For those who keep bring it up, no, weening after a few weeks when you know you’re pregnant would not be ground for removal in this scenario. This applies to those who have no intent of quitting, and exhibit no attempt at quitting either behaviors. Common sense would still be applied by CPS. ",0

Teachers who stop class to embarrass kids really need to reconsider their maturity,14096,626,2020-08-10 07:50:09,"I've seen this happen in class and I've experienced it. A student will do something that DOESN'T disrupt the class, but annoys the teacher, so the teacher will stop class for a good 5+ minutes to embarrass the student. 

It's so counterproductive. It doesn't do anything but ACTUALLY disrupt class, it doesn't teach the students any life lesson, and it makes the student being embarrassed dislike the teacher more than they probably already had.

It makes it clear to any adult that the teacher has self-esteem/maturity issues outside of class and bullies their students to make themselves feel good. It's not right, and it deserves some kind of reprimand or punishment.

EDIT: I'm not saying punishment is a bad thing, I'm saying embarrassment can ruin a student's motivation to do well, and it should NOT be used as a form of punishment. If a student is doing something wrong, it's okay to tell them to stop. What's NOT okay is dragging it on long enough to disrupt class for a good chunk of time, effectively drawing attention to the student for that long while the teacher just rants instead of offering criticism (which should be done out of class).

"Porn is incredibly harmful, and its effects aren't taken seriously enough.",14093,2289,2020-04-23 06:18:08,"([Source](http://endsexualexploitation.org/wp-content/uploads/NCOSE_Pornography-PublicHealth_ResearchSummary_8-2_17_FINAL-with-logo.pdf)) 

49% of men first encountered pornography before age 13. 

Analysis of the 50 most popular pornographic videos (those bought and rented most often) found that 88% of scenes contained physical violence, and 49% contained verbal aggression.12 Eighty-seven percent of aggressive acts were perpetrated against women, and 95% of their responses were either neutral or expressions of pleasure.

A meta-analysis of 46 studies reported that the effects of exposure to pornographic material are “clear and consistent,” and that pornography use puts people at increased risk for committing sexual offenses and accepting rape myths.

A study of 14- to 19-year-olds found that females who watched pornographic videos were at significantly greater likelihood of being victims of sexual harassment or sexual assault.

A survey of 4,564 adolescents aged 14–17 in five European countries found that viewing Internet pornography is significantly associated with an increased probability of having sent sexual images and messages (sexting) among boys.31 A separate survey of 617 college freshman found that 30% of participants sent nude pictures at some time during high school; 45% had received nude pictures on their cell phones. The most important motivation for sexting was coercion such as blackmail or threats. About half of all sexting is coercive.

44% of males aged 11–16 who viewed pornography reported that online pornography gave them ideas about the type of sex they wanted to try.

A nationally representative survey of pornography use among youth aged 9–17, found that those with increased exposure to Internet pornography were significantly more likely to report physical and sexual victimization.

A study of sexually reactive children and adolescents (SRCAs) found that those who used pornography compared to those who did not use pornography were more likely to engage in a prominent pattern of lying, a persistent pattern of theft/stealing, to be truant, to frequently con/manipulate others, to engage in arson/fire setting behaviors, to engage in coerced vaginal penetration and forced sexual acts such as oral or digital penetration, to express sexually aggressive remarks (obscenities), and to engage in sex with animals.

In a cross-sectional study of 710 Norwegian 18- to 19-year-olds, 19.1% of males who indicated some likelihood of having sex with a 13- to 14-year old also reported more high-frequency use of pornography and having more friends with an interest in child pornography and violent pornography

The use of pornography by batterers significantly increased a battered woman’s odds of being sexually abused. Pornography use alone increased the odds by a factor of almost 2, and the combination of pornography and alcohol increased the odds of sexual abuse by a factor of 3

Males who use pornography and go to strip clubs were found to engage in more sexual abuse, stalking, and marital rape than abusers who did not use pornography and go to strip clubs

A study of male high school seniors in Sweden found that nearly 70% of those who frequently used pornography reported that pornography made them want to try out what they had seen compared to 42% of boys in a reference group

Males who viewed pornography were significantly more likely to report having sexually harassed a peer or forcing someone to have sex

In a systematic review and meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies about young people aged 10-24 years, exposure to sexually explicit websites was correlated with condomless sexual intercourse

In a study of 15,246 Americans, a symmetrical relationship was revealed between men and women as a result of viewing pornography. Women reported more negative consequences, including: lowered body image; that their partner was more critical of their body; increased pressure to perform acts seen in pornography; and less actual sex. Meanwhile, men reported being more critical of their partners’ bodies and less interest in actual sex.

If you can read all of that and tell me that porn isn't harmful, or that you're still going to watch it, I don't want you anywhere near me.
