cmv mike bloombergs campaign is proof that the ultra wealthy in the us can afford a higher tax rate with no ill effect on them,"mike bloomberg recently dropped out of the 2020 presidential race after spending over 500 million dollars of his own money on his campaign even with this loss he is still worth over 55 billion dollars
 believe that this effortless spending on bloombergs part showcases the reality that is wealth inequality between the ultra rich and working class while i do not believe the rich should give up their fortunes i do believe that any arguments against taxing them more is simply propaganda from those who hold the wealth and higher power at this point  media outlets claim that taxing the super wealthy is unfair and would be detrimental to those below them due to trickle down effects there is also rhetoric that many self made billionaires worked hard for their fortunes and that if we as americans work hard we might be rich ourselves one day believe that moving forward we should push for much higher taxes on those earningworth more than 1 billion usd if the money bloomberg spent on his campaign went to actual communities that need funding actual change could have been possible social programs could benefit greatly from these funds and maybe we could afford to better fund national programs such as healthcare or family leave",1,211,1268,128,0.0546875
cmv kanye west is a shill for president trump and running to syphon off young voters from voting for biden,kanye west is a shill for president trump and running to syphon off young voters from voting for biden first he may have an excentric take on reality but cant honestly believe that he has a chance of winning second if he truly wanted to be president he would have started his campaign last year when he still had a chance to get on state ballots third he has been an avid defender of trump and the maga agenda just from reviewing other threads on reddit there are people willing to vote for him generally speaking the fan base of artists like kanye skews young and culturally diverse which are both not likely to vote for trump  are plenty of other reasons you can say that kanye is running but unless you say how my view is flawed i will only consider those reasons as supplemental to the above concept and not as a replacement for interesting ,1,159,1039,108,0.06481481481481481
cmv donald trump has not made a single lasting positive impact on the usa during his term as president,i write this because i am tired of the wild goose chase that is finding examples of his success anything surrounding donald trump is shrouded in divisive language and biased opinions liberals will have you believe he has done nothing while conservatives will tout his unlimited success i must be missing it because any time i try to research into a topic i get lost in opinion and bias  am completely willing to hear and review and accept any examples of success or lasting positive change that has come about as a direct result of trumps presidency in fact i want to it can’t be all bad a lot of responses here i need to actually read the sources for the claims everyone’s making so it may take a while for me to respond to each comment but i will try i’ll take this chance to remind everyone it’s possible to have civil discourse about even the most divisive topics even the infamous djt thanks all for the responses double thanks to those who are responding and engaging one another civilly and awarding the post i think it’s important to realize how biased we can become despite the facts the good things don’t necessarily outweigh the bad so maybe there’s a counterpost to be made regarding all of the harm djt has done as well every point has a counter point so take anything you hear with the ole’ grain of salt i urge everyone to educate themselves and vote in the upcoming election for the candidate they believe in  and don’t let politics negatively impact your happiness it’s just like any other thing and can be harmful in high doses definitely had my view changed i wanted examples of positives and i received examples with sources i appreciate everyone’s responses and feel better about having informed conversation about djt’s presidency still have a lot to read and respond to,1,322,1852,104,0.07692307692307693

cmv us presidential candidates should take an exam covering us government and law foreign policy as well as undergo a comprehensive cognitive exam,edit ok this has been fun and some great conversation but i am beginning to feel like a oneman army trying to defend the gates of sparta  have changed my mind for three reasons  testtaking ability is not necessarily an indication of ones ability to run the office of the president  he who creates the questions dictates the barrier for entry  freedom of speech is a slippery slope and even though announcing ones intent to run for president can and will continue to be abused you cant knock out one brick and expect the wall to remain intact therefore i am hereby announcing my bid to run as vp with kim kardashian  still believe standardized cognitive testing should be administered this could be automated perhaps using opensource nback software or various standardized cognitive testing designed to screen for early cognitive decline  of who you like this is a democracy so register to vote and get those ballots in by november  original post  office of the president of the united states is being used as a tool to boost social media presence to syphon votes and to simply sell products this is an abuse of the office of the presidency and should be illegal especially if someone has zero intent on running or winning  limit entry into this field and to limit the abuse of power that has been recently demonstrated by kanye west it should be illegal to announce you are running for president unless you undergo a comprehensive set of exams that show you have at least a basic mental competency to run the united states of america  results of these exams should be available to everyone as a passfail though the exact scores should be held secret so as not to be used to favor one candidate with a higher score over another they should cover cognitive physical as well as brain scans using mri eeg etc these tests may not completely stop such abuse they would make it far more difficult for any celebrity to simply announce to their millions of twitter followers that they are running for president more importantly voters could be assured that any candidate running for president has passed a basic competency exam which would prevent candidates from using perceived cognitive decline as a political weapon,1,393,2317,150,0.04666666666666667
cmv offduty cops are just civilians and should have none of the legal protections of being a cop for their actions,offduty cops are just regular people who are not at work whatever actions they do should be viewed legally as a civilian doing them there is no reason why the legal protections of being a cop should extend to their activities off duty actions if someone is in dangerbreaking the law they should intervene as a civilian meaning they have no legal responsibility to provide aid or execute the law if an offduty cop kills someone it should be treated as if that person where a civilian who killed someone i am not arguing whether or not the actions of off duty cops are right or wrong just that those actions are not special and should face the same legal scrutiny as any other civilian to add the st louis metropolitan department explained the work of its unnamed officer this way in a statement “to clarify secondary employment allows officers to work security in uniform and carry their departmentissued weapons the officer while not on duty for the police department still has the same responsibilities and power to affect arrest and the officer operates in the capacity as a st louis police officer also acknowledge that onduty cops are civilians i just needed a word to make the distinction,1,209,1240,117,0.03418803418803419
cmv will smith was correct in 2016 when he said racism is not getting worse its getting filmed one of the biggest problems in american society is mean world syndrome and these riots are evidence of that,i imagine most rioters would justify their outrage by saying theyre tired of unarmed men especially black men being killed by police at an alarming rate but this is not supported by the data in fact the opposite is true number of deadly police shootings of unarmed people has generally declined since 2015 even as the tally of fatal shootings by law enforcement is on pace to hit nearly 1000 for the fourth year in a row according to data gathered by the washington post behold in 2019 we have even fewer unarmed shootings than 2018 when this article was published justified police killings are staying steady which is not ideal but they are not increasing why the widespread misperception of unarmed shootings getting worse 2016 will smith said racism is not getting worse its getting filmed been some confusion about what he meant some say he meant its bringing racism to the forefront of national attention not so said he disagrees with people who think that the situation has gotten progressively worse actually not even convinced that its racism that were seeing when a cop does something awful to a black suspect that would be a post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy all white cops are no more likely to shoot black suspects than black cops race of a police officer did not predict the race of the citizen shot in other words black officers were just as likely to shoot black citizens as white officers were guess you could say black cops are racist against other black men but that seems unlikely im not convinced of that and its impossible to prove either way anyway theres a concept in sociology called mean world syndrome world syndrome is a cognitive bias where people perceive the world to be more dangerous than it actually is due to longterm moderate to heavy exposure to violencerelated content on mass mediamean world syndrome asserts that viewers who are exposed to violencerelated content can experience increased fear anxiety pessimism and heightened state of alert in response to perceived threats this is because media namely television consumed by viewers has the power to directly influence and inform their attitudes beliefs and opinions about the world concept is supported by the data i shared above about how unarmed shootings have actually decreased and are continuing to decrease think even vehement antipolice advocates would have to concede that this is a very real and very salient problem in mass media after all the phrase if it bleeds it leads has been around in journalism for decades is what has helped inspired so much antipolice hatred the media is very skilled at manipulating the populace into fear and distrust you dont believe me just look at the 2016 shooting of dallas police officers by a man who was radicalized by the media andor black lives matter july 7 2016 micah xavier johnson ambushed and fired upon a group of police officers in dallas texas killing five officers and injuring nine others two civilians were also wounded johnson was an army reserve afghan war veteran and was angry over police shootings of black men and stated that he wanted to kill white people especially white police officers the shooting happened at the end of a protest against the police killings of alton sterling in baton rouge louisiana and philando castile in falcon heights minnesota which had occurred in the preceding days see this as one of the most egregious examples of mean world syndrome so what would change my view is a perspective that suggests that the publics extreme reaction to this most recent police killing is not actually mean world syndrome but some other reason that has a rational basis,1,622,4512,210,0.05238095238095238
cmv the most sensible thing to do if youre ever given a chance to sell your soul to satan is to refuse because the existence of satan would be implicit proof of an afterlife,stories where people sell their soul to the devil make no sense to me for one specific reason if the devil makes you that offer it is proof that he exists and if he exists then that means some sort of afterlife must exist as well  because the  trade off for whatever gain you make from selling your soul is eternal damnation in hell  if you just decline and live a virtuous life for the next 80 years or whatever you get to go to heaven instead even if you live in the most wretched abject poverty on earth suffering through 80 years of that in exchange for a good afterlife experience seems to make way more sense to me than whatever temporary comfort and eternal damnation youd get from selling your soul cant really see much of a flaw in this logic but maybe yall can point out something i missed  omg this blew up im seeing a lot of good comments ill do my best to respond as i can throughout the day,1,179,947,176,0.03409090909090909

cmv if employers expect a two week notice when employees quit they should give the same courtesy in return when firing someone,"i’ll start off by saying i don’t mean this for major situations where someone needs to be let go right away if someone is stealing obviously you don’t need to give them a two week notice 
 
so to my point  always say how it’s the “professional” thing to do and you “don’t want to burn bridges” when leaving a job they say you should give the two week notice and leave on good terms or that you should be as honest with your employers and give as much heads up as possible so they can properly prepare for your replacement i know people who’s employers have even asked for more than the two weeks so that they can train someone new  i don’t disagree with many of this and do think it is the professional thing to do i think there is some hypocrisy with this  your employers needs time to prepare for your departure but if they want to let you go they can fire you on the spot leaving you scrambling for a job  the employer can ask you to stay a bit longer if possible to train someone but you don’t really get the chance to ask for a courtesy two weeks  it puts the importance of a company over the employee it’s saying that employee should be held to a higher standard than an employer as an employee you should be looking out for the better of this company and be a “team player”  there are situations where giving a two week notice isn’t needed if you have a terrible employer who you don’t think treats you fairly why do you need the two week notice if you feel unappreciated and disrespected why is it rude to not give a notice  that’s the case then why do people not say the same about employers firing people with no notice how come that’s not rude and unprofessional why is that seen as a business move but giving no notice of quitting is seen as unprofessional  we’re holding employees to a standard we should hold companies to the same standards 
 thank you for all the responses i didnt think this would get this large clearly i cant respond to 800 plus comments i understand everyones comments regarding safety and thats a valid point just to be clear i am not in favor of terminating an employee that you think will cause harm and giving them two weeks to continue working i think a severance is fair as others have mentioned it is how it is in their country however i agree with the safety issue and why you wouldnt give the notice i was more so arguing that if you expect a notice you need to give something similar in return",1,473,2539,129,0.031007751937984496
cmv if you name your child something like abcde pronounced absidy and get upset at the mispronunciation or negative attention it brings you knew what you were doing and you wanted the attention for yourself,"recently saw an issue going around social media where and airport worker shared the ticket for a child named abcde and her mother went feral about the negative attention  it seems any attention the name recieves is shaming or bullying feel terrible that a child is involved in this but i dont see any other explanation then this girl mother planned for and most likely desired this situation when she chose a name seems down right delusional to select an absurd or elaborately out of the ordinary spelling for a name and not expect attention or criticism it would be nice if that wasnt the world we lived in but really believing that would be a break from reality  and what is the point of a unique name other than standing out and seeking attention honestly more appalled by the indignation of the mother than actions of the airline employee who starts this
 so i need to clarify im not trying to argue that the worker who shared it wasnt crossing a line what she did was unprofessional people keep trying to direct the conversation in that direction but i agree with it  my position is more that the parents are culpable in this too i was talking with a former nurse from davidson michigan tonight about this apparently during her tenure a judge had previously prevented a mom from naming her twins gonorrhea and syphilis so there is some precidents in the us justice system prevent certain names apparently laa is a fairly common spelling for ladasha wow this blew up",1,265,1554,215,0.023255813953488372
cmv gender dysphoria is a cureable mental illness weve stopped looking for the cure because society is now forced into accepting transgenders,i know this is a big yikes to post in 2020 but i am posting this because i truely want my view to be changed i know it is offensive to a lot of people i have only met one transgender in my entire life and my view is probably mostly based on this person lets call her lana and on the transgenders you see on the television was male till the age of 19 where he told me he thought he was a girl it was a very surreal moment for me he had a huge beard and manly structure and there he sat telling me he felt like he was a girl i knew for sure he was joking we had a habit of making fucked up jokes so i bursted out in laughter he told me again and added that he wanted to start progressing into a female this was 7 years ago knew lana has been dealing with mental illness her entire life she had a very rough childhood due to undiagnosed autism adhd and depression for some reason i connected that in my head to her becoming a transgender she had undiagnosed problems and concluded that she didnt fit in because she wasnt in the right body writing this out makes my face turn red a little because i know thoughts like these are heavily frowned upon but it is what i currently truely believe i think proper therapy could have been a solution to let him deal with his past and feel comfortable and confident about who he is i dont think mutilating body and everyone acting like shes a girl should be an acceptable cure time i see people on television interacting with transgenders they seem very  disingenuous to me patronizing almost wow youre so brave and stunning thoughts that come to mind are for gods sake stop playing along this person is suffering and needs serious mental help not to be put on a pedestal i feel the same whenever im near lana and out of respect ive distanced myself from her i dont want to offend her and i dont want to play along  support what i think is a cureable illness ive studied social work childcare which probably plays part in why i think like i do sure that if lana wasnt bullied as much as she was he wouldve felt more like he fit in im convinced that his autism adhd and depression next to not fitting in made him feel feminine and more distanced to his masculinity change my view thanks reddit youve done it  gender dysphoria is a mental illness for which currently the best available treatment is transitioning im surpised at how much this blew up when i wrote this post i was very uninformed and filled with assumptions regarding gender dysphoria thank you to everyone who commented with personal stories information statistics researches and all the sources to back them up they have changed my view and based from the pms and comments ive read theyve changed many other peoples views too,1,520,2879,145,0.034482758620689655

cmv if great britain not giving the 13 us colonies representation in parliament was so unfair its not fair that guampuerto ricoall the us territories dont get representation in congress,edit thank you all so much youve helped me to see many of the reasons why my opinion was flawed i will be tapping out of the conversation thanks once again basically what the title says the 13 colonies basically british territories but more self sufficient than us territories didnt get representation in parliament which let to the american war of independence so why doesnt the us give the us territories representatives in congress i understand that the colonists basically selfgoverned but they still had to follow british rule and pay taxes to britain so they wanted representation no taxation wo representation so since people in us territories pay some taxes to the us government they should get some voting representatives in congress right i think the main thing im unsure of is that the us territories arent as selfsustained as the 13 colonies,1,144,889,192,0.036458333333333336
cmv if trump gets reelected i have to accept that the people and the government have spoken and i am just incompatible with the us,"so basically if trump gets reelected im seriously considering moving somewhere else i should say that i thought i loved this country but maybe i loved a version of it that doesnt actually exist i figure that the country has spoken and what im hearing is that its a theocratic oligarchy people are increasingly unable to see other views because what their religion says is the right thing meanwhile those that are rich and powerful are exploiting this for their benefit other themes that i believe are too strong for the country to shake are misinformation racism xenophobia etc seeing all branches of government become entrenched with this breed of conservatives and what is that but the reflection of what the people want and what is the country if not the government and the people want my view changed on the following the us government is too entrenched with radical conservative politicians
 the above is because the people of the us want this
 i love a version of this country that doesnt exist as is evident
 one should move to a different country if they dont feel represented and have incompatible views with too much of the government even if they can vote and are comfortable",1,206,1219,134,0.06716417910447761
cmv big cruises do more harm than good and the planet is better off if the industry dies or is overhauled,"i guess i should start by saying i have a pretty substantial hatred of crowded spaces call it what you want enochlophobia agoraphobia etc i dont even like going to concerts crowded movie theaters on opening day etc  said i just feel the whole concept of a cruise is weird other than supplying hundreds of thousands of people with jobs at least here in the usa i dont see a ton of true benefits this industry provides vs harm  as it currently stands now granted perhaps some changes will come along to make cruises less harmful to our planet but so far i see no evidence that the cruise industry is making the world a better place  first pollution these ships are giant floating cities that create tons of waste and even despite regulation each cruise ship contributes to some portion of sewage gray water hazardous wastes oily bilge water ballast water and solid waste being dumped into our oceans rivers etc nevermind the air pollution they can cause with one study even claiming that carnival cruise ships emitted nearly 10 times more sulfur oxide around european coasts than did all 260 million european cars in with royal caribbean at four times more than the european cars 
 then there is the whole disease problem clearly things like covid19 will continue to happen maybe not every year but putting thousands of people in a confined ship for a week floating out in the middle of the ocean seems like an awful idea not to mention the cycle of stopping at new ports letting people off and in turn letting them infect each destination the cruise liner embarks for the damn thing is like a floating petri dish 
 youre basically trapped in a floating mall for 7 days where everything is overpriced even if you think that allinclusive price is a bargain everyone i know who has taken a cruise has spent more money than they anticipated be it booze gifts etc i know there are cruise lines like sea dream which truly are allinclusive but most of the big players carnival rc norwegian etc nickel and dime you to death not to mention most affordable rooms are small and cramped and youll rarely ever spend more than a day at port at any number of the destinations you visit giving you very little time to take in the scenery culture etc  not saying all cruise lines are bad but the mega ones with thousands of people on them seem terrible and i just cant see how they actually are more beneficial than bad for our planet economy etc that said im open to understanding why this industry is a good thing cmv
 first wow didnt expect this to take off the way it did 
 second i realize my third bullet point has more to do with my personal distaste for cruises and does very little to strengthen my argumentview this has nothing to do with people who like cruises vs people who do not 
 third there was a ton of information i left out of my op that supports my view such as how cruises can disrupt marine life and how working on a cruise can be a terrible experience for the crew etc 
 finally my view hasnt really changed if anything due to the fact there are so many poorersmaller economies that depend on cruises for revenue etc  im much more in favor of overhauling the industry vs seeing it die but again this post was never about making cruises illegal or banning them just give it a nice facelift cheers",1,611,3727,108,0.046296296296296294
cmv compared to other developed nations america is a “shithole” country for all but the wealthy and wellconnected,tldr  the us lacks in almost every quantifiable category i can think of especially when compared to european and scandinavian nations only exception being if you have money andor influential connections cue long list of stats and sources removing references to the global youknowwhat that ends in 19 i feel that our response to that situation is worth discussing but the automod suppressed the original post and i dont feel those points are integral to the overall view for the purposes of this sub i believe this are not the most free  are number 1 in incarceration both total and per capita here being convicted of a felony takes away your right to vote us is 45th in press freedom my view has been thoroughly changed on this i recognize the ranking isn’t legitimate but lets also not forget that in the recent blm protests police were arresting journalists and attacked people for recording them from private property the most democratic are actually 25th have a massive wealth gap in our country  12 of americans live under the poverty line and almost 40 of americans can’t afford an unexpected 400 expense us has a gini coefficient measurement of wealth inequality of 0852 with a coefficient of 1 meaning almost complete wealth inequality also have one of the highest homeless populations is only truly accessible by the rich  health care spending per person in the us hit 10000 in 2016 and is predicted to be 14000 by 2023 explains why over 66 of bankruptcy filings in the us are due to medicalrelated expenses even just getting to the hospital in an ambulance here can cost you thousands we are not a healthy country  are number 12 in the world for obesity with over 36 of our population obese by far the highest ranking western country edit  there are 235 million people in the us who live in food deserts which is why i consider this a failing of the country rather than personal choices us consistently has more deaths from treatable diseases than comparable countries uk canada france australia etc education is only accessible to those with money  cost of higher education ranges from 10k to 36k compared to virtually nothing in other western nations this means higher education either burdens us students with a lifetime of debt or keeps all but the wealthiest from attending us is 31st in the world in reading math and science with 27 of top us performers registering as wealthy while only 4 as poor or disadvantaged when it comes to raising a child need a ton of money for that too due to lack of free child care and no federal family leave policy and that link shows alabama probably one of the cheapest states to live in in the whole country the police in response to police brutality police around the country responded with unprecedented violence going as far as to run protesters over with cars and shoot people who aren’t even protesting on their porches they specifically targeted journalists trying to report on the situation nations around the world have condemned the us response to what have been by and large peaceful protests many americans are still very dumb that only 83 of american adults think that the measles vaccine which has been around in some form since the 1960’s is safe that’s almost 55 million americans who are either unsure of its safety or think it’s unsafe aka southern states get textbooks edited to portray the civil war as being about states rights not about slavery many of those same southern states have as little as 75 of students with high school diplomas american dream is more achievable outside the us than inside here is a link to the raw data which i cant possibly get through but in case anyone disagreed with the article for things that have become partisan for some reason roe v wade being a bipartisan decision by the supreme court republicans still campaign on stacking the court and directing them to overturn the decision not only taking away a womans right to seek an abortion but grossly overstepping the separation of the executive and judicial branches all because of religious values has outright said he wont fund the post office so he can disrupt mailin voting a clear attack on a basic democratic principle and this was after he tweeted about wanting to delay the election even if it was a red herring to distract from the disastrous economic numbers mcconnell also refused to consider the stimulus bill due to the usps funding further screwing over average americans dont get me started on mcconnell the man who has basically made it his lifes work breaking our democracy most famous of which being when he blocked obamas legitimate supreme court nomination just on principle elect bigoted people to represent our bigoted populous trump also gave rush limbaugh the presidential medal of freedom despite his bigoted remarks deny climate change and our government is destroying the environment for the sake of helping corporate interests most of the country the gay panic defense is a legal justification for killing an lgbtq person and conversion therapy is legal in most areas as well just a few examples of the deeply rooted homophobia in this country number 1 in gun violence but large swaths of the country still prefer that to any form of gun control sure im forgetting one stat or another but i feel like its been covered pretty sufficiently is america the worst country in the world no im not going as extreme as to say we live in a 3rd world country but by the standards of other developed nations the us lags far behind in almost every aspect i can think of americans who don’t have money or aren’t willing to go into crippling debt because god forbid you want healthcare or to be educated you’re basically screwed and would almost certainly be better off living somewhere in western europe or scandinavia instead change my view like i should put a disclaimer that i am going by the numbers i have lived a comfortable life here as im sure many others have but my argument is also that if you have lived a comfortable life here either that indicates some level of wealthpower andor that your quality of life would still be better in a europeanscandinavian country my view  felt that i should include that our federal minimum wage is only 3k a year above the poverty line and unable to support a person living anywhere in the country 1  since i keep getting the same points repeated to me over and over again ill just address them here since i just got the notification this hit the front page i definitely wont be able to address even most of these comments at this point but ill do my best i made about homelessness  i know that made no sense you can stop bringing it up the people who are telling me that i cant compare the us to european countries  i awarded a delta for someone who pointed out that it would be better to look at the eu as a whole however i dont think its a legitimate argument to entirely write off comparing the us to individual countries since while we may have a massive population and gdp to match our per capita gdp isnt that much higher than the countries im comparing it to to reiterate again i am not arguing that it is impossible to achieve a good life here in the us or that were a 3rd world country maybe you

cmv bernie supporters who would sit out if he doesnt win the nomination are acting like spoiled brats,as things stand right now i do feel like i align the most with sanders from an ideological perspective i dont agree with all of his policy goals but his rationales behind promoting these policies are admirable and the kind of attitude we need in a president  being said if joe biden wins the democratic nomination i would enthusiastically vote for him bernie himself even recognizes the potential crisis for progressive values if trump were to win a second term in my mind it should be viewed as objectively better to vote for someone who shares 8090 of the same progressive values will help work to pass liberal legislation and will get the country on the path for additional progressive policies in the near future than it is to allow trump to continue to dismantle our institutional integrity and hope for a reactionary leftist resurgence in 2024  to add on that last point i think its really stupid that left wing voters would hope that their side acts like the right does whenever the centerleft does anything reactionary politics sucks in the long run its the reason why other than the aca which ill get to in a minute no major federal programs have been passed for a long time the bernie bros are acting like the tea party the tea party is already dead suffocated with a plastic bag by the trumpist cartel unless the democratic socialist wing is willing to put in the work for long term consistent success instead of being reactionary theyll be gone too before theyre able to properly implement any of their lofty but well intentioned goals  back to the aca getting that passed was a huge accomplishment that nobody should take lightly its far from perfect but its something its the biggest initiative in the federal government since the civil rights act and the biggest tangible social policy implemented since fdr passed social security medicare and medicaid those amazing things were all passed during periods of consistent democratic control of congress while eisenhower who was hardly conservative relative to today and nixonford held power for only 1648 years last century if bernie supporters want to implement any major policies like those they need to be willing to bite their tongues and vote for more moderate democrats now and incrementally get more progressive over time which doesnt have to be that long of a time they just have to show up now so we dont keep going back and forth dont really have a knock against bernie i think hes a great man and a great candidate and i hope he does well today so my vote for him in the next couple rounds means something if people are willing to rally around him now this isnt as much of a concern a lot of his supporters from the most affluent bernie bros to the actual working class people who are willing to not show up if biden wins the nom are acting spoiled in my view if biden wins and youre not willing to show up for him in the general it obviously must not be that important to you to get these major policies passed like if youre actually struggling and you think berniestyle policies are what you need to improve your situation you should be willing to take 8090 of that instead of nothing if not i dont believe that youre actually struggling you just like to act like a victim  cmv is there actually any value to this all or nothing attitude where youre willing to lose unless you get 100 of what you want or are people acting ridiculous this is blowing up so apologies if i take a little while to respond already gave out a delta but im absolutely going to be following up throughout the day thanks for the great responses even to the people spite downvoting me ill try to get to you soon 2 i keep seeing a lot of the same comments so just know im not going to get to everyone i just dont have the time for 1900 comments when so many are the same so heres a couple things i dont agree with so that the comments might slow down  i simply do not agree and will not agree that letting trump win now is strategically sound for future progressive candidates because four more years of trump is four more years of the gop rigging elections and installing policy roadblocks so unless your game theory argument is much different save it  im not going to be convinced that biden is worse than trump our political system is what it is you dont get to stick it to the man by letting the man win again go vote for people who will do most of what you want instead of the opposite of what you want 3 shout out to the real ones who gave my ass gold and platinum,1,835,4701,103,0.038834951456310676
cmv religion has absolutely no place in a modern society,religion has had some good in the past when people where absolutely ignorant about the world it used to be a great tool to answer unsolvable mysteries and guide people who had no idea what the fuck life was about it has also always been about controlling the masses and brainwashing these poor people constantly living in fear of chastisement by some infinitely powerful being you better act nice now or insert your divinity here will fuck you up for eternity whats that you guys believe in a different god than us looks like its time for a god damn blood bath but sure religions are about peace and kindness unless you dont believe in the right one i already see you guys coming with the oh but dont put all the apples in the same basket theres some bad religious people but there are some good ones too  that bro the actions of those bad apples far outweigh the positive aspects of the good ones yes some religious people contribute to charity and stuff but do you really need religion for that cant you just be a good person without it how is no one calling them cults its the same fucking thing if some nutjob claims to be the son of a god today everyone laughs at him and calls him crazy cause he is but sometimes he gets a following and were all like well clearly this is a cult these people are fucking stupid to believe that this guy is any kind of divinity whatsoever how many of the ones who laugh at cults are actually religious id bet its a fuckton ofem but sure fuck introspection and lets all be hypocrites final point now some of you may argue that religion is also about spirituality and trying to better yourself as a person its a moral compass again fuck that shit you dont need a fucking cult leader whos been dead for thousands of years to tell you how to act we have social norms and things that are acceptable and things that arent just be a fucking adult and reflect on your actions and thoughts and better yourself that way most religious people as i said earlier only follow that moral compass to escape an imminent doom when they die not to actually be good people they do it out of fear and i dont think that makes you a good person that makes you a coward whos scared of something nonexistent should and needs to be abolished but of course thatll never happen oh well  religions are about controlling people have been and always will be a source of violence and hatred they are cults and need to be abolished just to clarify i do not wish any harm or hatred towards any religious people and i am for letting people belive what they want to live and let live however i just think religion shouldnt be a part of our society anymore i am against religion as a concept in a modern society not against religious people i know religion was a pillar of humanity in the past i do not think it is still required today you for your time everyone there are some insghtful comments that made me reflect and i did soften my view on the subject abolishing religion was a poor choice of words it should just die out slowly while only keeping the positive morals of it through education however my view is not changed 2 guys i stopped carring about the post after 100 comments stop private messaging me im not going to answer lmao,1,611,3422,58,0.06896551724137931
cmv americans treat  discuss about 911 as if it was one of the worst or most devastating events in history it shows both how hypocritical americans are as in regards to international affair as well as how narrowminded some americans are,okay the total number of lives that were lost during 911 was 2977 because of this not purely the us invaded afghanistan as well as began the war on terror from the west since the afghan war began there have almost been 4k military deaths western states only almost 100k deathsserious injuries to civilians in the last 10 years within afghanistan alone if you want to add the 10 more years since they began the war plus the many other countries they have ruined economically and physically then the number is easily tenfold dont get me wrong it was a tragedy and an act of terrorism but the way that americans speak about it and describe the events its as if they way to justify the millions and millions of lives they have ruined in response its also not just the way they speak of it or remember it its the extremely hypocritical ways in which leading us politicianseconomistsleaders reference it some examples giuliani the attacks of september 11th were intended to break our spirit instead we have emerged stronger and more unified we feel renewed devotion to the principles of political economic and religious freedom the rule of law and respect for human life we are more determined than ever to live our lives in freedom dahl if we learn nothing else from this tragedy we learn that life is short and there is no time for hate me start by saying that i am willing to change my mind on this perspective the opinion that i would like changed is that the way in general that americans depict 911 is disgustingly hypocritical and overtly dramatic revealing how narrowminded the majority of americans can beare the american discourse surrounding 911 and the proceeding events are so slanted in the american favour that it undermines the impact they had on afghanistan and the innocent civilians in all of the middle east 1 thank you for all the responses i have definitely shifted my opinion slightly there are a lot of responses so i will do my best to respond to everyone 2 again thank you for the all responses especially the informative and constructive ones i have altered my opinion on how and what the general american thinks about the 911 and the proceeding events  however i remain that the discourse from us media and institutional leaders is still hypocritical and reveals their slanted perspective of international affairs ,1,410,2458,244,0.02459016393442623
cmv ban on sleeping in vehicles is just targeting lowerincome and impoverished persons there is no justifiable reason to have a ban on living in a vehicle in larger cities and smaller towns alike so long as the vehicular occupant is not being disruptive or breaking other laws,"update 3 stop sending me bloody threats or your opinions through private message  received a message and i quote if you want people to sleep in cars so bad why dont we have them all park outside your house so they can sell drugs in your property rpe your daughters murder your spouse and leech off the government but pin it all on your hands you dont need to verbally assault someone for an opinion on any matter in the world if you want to debate this comment on the threat im declining all pms about the issue here on out 2 ive had a field day replying to all of you guys ive changed my opinion a fair bit its a difficult topic on one hand morally speaking i want to be able to make it easier for people to get off the street but to make it legal to sleep in a typical car there are so many things that have to be taken into consideration legal changes new regulation taxation sanitary conditions ive decided to retract my statement and change my opinion that it should be legal to sleep in any vehicle however i add this sleeping in regulationconforming vehicles ie vans trucks minivans that have adequate space are kept sanitary can generate electricity are livable should be legal and permitted sleeping in an everyday civic or another car that is not designated for sleeping permanently should not be allowed except in the following circumstancesa the person can not get home safely and just needs to sleep for a short period of time or the person is under the influence of substances and feels unsafe operating their vehicle and cannot get other accommodation or rideshare so they sleep in their vehicle outside of a bar party location etcb the person is in a domestic or violent situation where it is unsafe for them to return homec the person is camping in a campsite which shouldnt be an issue with the topic of this post at all and chooses to sleep in their vehicled the persons who are sleeping in the vehicle are travelling and it is not a permanent situationall of the aforementioned conditions would make it absolutely legal to sleep in your vehicle
2 if there was to be a provision made in the future to allow sleeping in vehicles and allow vehicles to be considered a property a property tax should be instated on it that way taxpaying homeowners do not feel disadvantageda in a sense the registation fee of a vehicle and the other monthly costs could be considered a property tax but i know it wouldnt make everyone happy a tax of living in the vehicle would make sense but then again would it its the best common ground
3 sleeping in a vehicle in the same location for more than 12 hours should be disallowed to ensure people do not reside in one location and block traffic or begin to claim territory as their own occupants would be required to move their vehicle throughout city streets if this does not happen their vehicle will be towed after warnings this in mind if you choose to comment on my post any further i will read replies but i am struggling to keep up with all of them i didnt expect this to go viral it was mostly a rant but you guys changed my mind and i appreciate that i didnt think it would happen when i made this post but it sure has 1 im going to go ahead and continue replying to everyone who shares their thoughts or opinion but i do want to say that my opinion has definitely been altered i still stand adamant that it should not be illegal especially in the cases which the person residing in their vehicle is not homeless but has income and can afford insurance a license and is not in a condition that they are unfit to drive though there must be regulation and potentially taxation especially in urban areas and large cities thanks to everyone who replied and thank you for those who are reading this i appreciate you all fail to grasp any logic behind big cities banning people from sleeping in vehicles they own instead of living in a permanent house of all its expensive as hell to live in a house it can cost 1500month or greater to rent a small apartment in a big city such as san diego about 30 minutes away from where i live it is extremely taxing on those who are struggling with minimum wage or low paying jobs and makes it much more difficult for homeless persons to get out of their situation it would be much more cost effective and much easier for those who are struggling to survive if they were to get a van or use a vehicle and live in that what would be 1500 a month could be cut into a 200 or 300 monthly payment whos living alone may not want a house in my situation im currently saving up for a van in order to live on the road while i work from my mobile home this is great for me i love travel dont have a lot of possessions and am a very simplistic person its a much cheaper much more enjoyable experience and the fact that i may have to be careful not to visit certain cities or wander too far into town during the night to park my vehicle always worries me a bit about my future if someone chooses to live in their car so long as the conditions are livable ie no moldleaking oilsome kind of air circulating in the vehicle there should be no legal issue with that much safer for someone to pull off in their vehicle than it is to continue driving while tired i remember one time i was driving down the freeway and i was just too tired to continue knowing that if i pulled off to sleep i would be woken up and told to leave by a leo i continued driving i actually fell asleep for brief 12 seconds moments at the wheel each one i jerked awake the minute i started to feel my car moving out of my lane it was scary and i wouldve much rather been able to legally pull off into a neighborhood or a city street and sleep for the night would love someone to educate me as to why this is illegal i struggle to find justifiable reasons as to why someone would not be allowed to sleep or even live out of their car anything that would normally require an address or established residence can easily be made up for such as a laundromat rather than an in home machine a po box a cell phone instead of a landline using public facilities instead of a personal toilet vans can be rigged with electricity the car produces electricity if needed through an inverter that can be plugged into the port in the dash and without a doubt its safer than sleeping on the street sleeping can be done discretely without being a disturbance and without the public even noticing or being affected it seems to me like the perfect way for someone who may not make 1500 a month but closer to 5600 a month to be able to save while still having a guaranteed place to sleep",1,1252,6884,281,0.0071174377224199285
cmv the electoral college is garbage and those that support it are largely doing so because it helps their side not because of any real feature of the system,"i dont think anyone could change my mind on the electoral college but im less certain about the second part  i dont particularly like throwing away swaths of arguments as bad faith but the arguments for the ec are so thin that its hard to see supporting it as anything other than a shrewd political ploy here are my main reasons for supporting a popular vote rather than the ec in general popular sovereignty is good  it should take very powerful considerations to take elections out of the hands of the people  i dont feel the need to argue for a popular vote system because its so clearly the best option for a nation that claims to be democratic you can say the whole republicdemocracy thing and i superduper dont care i know we are a republic  i passed high school civics  we could have a popular vote system that chooses the executive and still be a republic  the ec is almost a popular vote system the way it operates now  its given the same result as a popular vote system 91 of the time  the times that it hasnt have been random close elections
2 one person one vote is a valuable principle and we should strive to live up to it  simple arithmetic can show that a voter in wyoming has around 3 times more influence on the ec than a voter in california  this wouldnt be true if it wasnt for the appropriations act in the 1920s which capped the number of people in the house of representatives at 435  in the ec as it was designed california would have many more electoral votes now and the gap between wyoming and cali wouldnt be nearly as large
3 there is no fundamental value in giving rural america an outsized say in elections  ive often heard that the ec was created to protect rural interests  this isnt true but even if it was i dont see the value in giving small states more influence  this is where i developed the idea that most of the arguments are in bad faith  particularly because the current kind of inequality we have now in the ec was never intended by the founders   if you are supporting the ec just because it favors rural areas and you also know rural areas tend to vote red then you just have that position for partisan reasons
4 the elector system is very dumb and bad  do we really want 538 people that weve never heard of to get the ability to overturn an election  this isnt a group of able statesmen the electors are largely partisan figures  in most states you dont even see that you are voting for an elector instead of for a candidate for president  these are elected officials only in the most vague sense of the term  the idea that this ceremonial body is some kind of safeguard is laughable
5 the concept of swing states is bad for democracy  focusing on groups of swing voters in 56 states leads to undue attention and money being used to persuade smaller groups of voters it also creates a sense of votes being worthless i was a democrat in a deep red state for a long time and it felt like my vote didnt matter because my state was going to go red anyway  and thats going to be true for most voters apart from the 56 swing states that are uncertain on election day  its hard to know if that is pushing turnout down but it certainly isnt having a positive effect
6 the ec makes elections less secure  instead of a popular vote system where it would take a hue effort to change enough votes to make a difference rigging state elections in swing states could have a huge impact  the targets for interference are clear wisconsin michigan arizona north carolina and florida could be changed with relatively small numbers of votes  this also makes voter suppression a tactic that can work on a national scale if applied in the correct states  i need to get to my actual workjob instead of rageposting about the electoral college ive enjoyed reading everyones responses and appreciate your participation some final responses to some underlying points ive seen lots of people saying i just hate the ec because of trump i have literally hated the electoral college since i learned about it in the 6th grade for me this isnt fully partisan i absolutely would still be against the electoral college if a democrat won the ec and a republican won the popular vote i know you may im lying and i grant that this isnt something i can really prove but its true feel free to hold me to it if that ever happens my position is currently and always has been the person who gets more votes should be president
2 the historic context of the electoral college while important to understanding the institution has an outsized influence on how we talk about presidential elections i would much rather look forward to a better system than opine about how wise the system set up in 1787 was the founders were smart smarter than me but we have 350 years of hindsight of how this system practically works which is very valuable
3 i was wrong to say all defenses of the ec were bad faith or partisan i see that now i still believe a portion of defenses are but there are exceptions the fact that most discussions of the ec happen just after a close election give all discussions surrounding the issue a hyperpartisan tone but that doesnt have to be the rule
4 if you think farmers are worth more to the country because theyre farmers i have some news to you about who was doing the farming in 1787 it wasnt the voters i can tell you that much
5 im sorry if i appeared brusque or unappreciative of your comments this thread got way more attention than i expected im rereading my responses now and theres absolutely some wording choices id change but i was in a hurry you all have a good day abolish the electoral college be gay do crime etc",1,1066,5853,159,0.025157232704402517

this tells me they have dipped their toes into every form of entertainments that can be consumed by the population of earth controlling media and entertainment is how you control a culture or the way it thinks and acts disney is not doing anything too drastic with their agenda yet but mark my words there will come a time when all of the media you can find online or entertainment will be censored by disney to fit their idea of what it should be  me break this down further disney has the authority to fire someone from one of their networks especially a public one like espn if they don’t agree with their views or agenda then since they have money they could make him disappear be it death by “suicide” or a lump sum to shut him up so if a talk host on espn said something controversial but valid disney has the ability to control him and what the viewers hear it’s censorship in the worst way  owns too much and has the power to do too much let me make another example star wars i know i know “tlj sucked not canon duurrrrr” i’m not here to bash the movies i’m here to bash the eu disney is controlling what type of star wars is released to the public before disney there was a plethora of risqué star wars media video games comics books etc but now it seems most star wars product are sterile safe and innocent in an effort to maintain an identity for appealing to the whole family eff that star wars was never restricted to one form of media and while the films were tamed the rest could have done whatever it wanted here’s another one star wars battlefront ii the video game was under scrutiny for its loot box fiasco gambling in games that kids can access i have never seen a game turn around as fast in my life and as delicately my guess disney cracked the whip on ea and their 10 year game deal and ea panicked because money talks if disney has the power to do that to ea they will have no trouble forcing an agenda into other networks that they own  i missing something does disney not have the freedom i think they do with the networks they own to me it seems they’re orchestrating some type of cultural shift by acquiring networks and studios in all forms of entertainment in order to push their own ideas and agendas after reading through some of your comments i think it’s necessary to clarify a few things i’m not an economist and my knowledge of this topic has been broadened immensely from just hearing what some of you had to say so thank you for enlightening a dull individual such as myself it has changed my view in some areas of this discussion  comcast is not owned by disney i misread that detail when doing a quick research i’m sorry for mixing that up  my terminology is not entirely accurate since i’m not as privy to the business side but the spirit of the post is still intact and is directed at disney having the control and influence over media and the ability to possibly censor or influence future generations",1,580,3297,103,0.038834951456310676
cmv despite what most people believe jesus ideals were closer to communist ideals rather than capitalist ones,"jesus taught many things and one was that you cannot serve both god and money matthew 624 capitalism functions off of selfish desires and greed while communism is suppose to function off of the idea of reaching equality for all you can argue about if thats been achieved successfully or not elsewhere but ideally communism represent a closer form of government to the one in which jesus was trying to show to the earth taught people to sell all they own and give the proceeds to the poor luke 1233 and luke 1433 and if you imagine everyone doing this it will end up achieving an equal distribution of wealth and of material possession  this in mind this is what the early church actually did in acts 
acts 432
all the believers were one in heart and mind no one claimed that any of their possessions was their own but they shared everything they had

acts 43435
that there were no needy persons among them for from time to time those who owned land or houses sold them brought the money from the sales and put it at the apostles’ feet and it was distributed to anyone who had need actions and the teachings of jesus line up way more with the ideal and ideas of communism than they do with capitalism is a christian video i saw which goes more in depth about people living this way and it sounds surprisingly similar to communism also cant really think of any quotes of jesus that would be in support of capitalism and how it functions as well which leads me to believe further that jesus ideals are closer to those of communist than of capitalist",1,283,1641,111,0.15315315315315314

2 biden is in severe cognitive decline go look at the debates from 2012 between him and paul ryan and then look at the debates he was in in 2019 and 2020 youll see a noticeable difference and trump is going to eat him alive for this he has trouble completing full sentences might be wondering okay it could be a tragic close loss but surely not a landslide what could possibly make you think that this brings us to trump is aiming to kill the united states postal service if we have to conduct the 2020 election mainly by mail this will make that impossible it will be unsafe for people to vote in person in november but the few people who are brave enough will be supporters of the candidate with more enthusiasm thats trump handsdown  will preface that i am a democrat and i do not want this to happen i would very much like my view changed",1,221,1225,52,0.09615384615384616

 meat has always been a big part of our natural life vegans are completely valid in what they choose to do but i find it a bit odd when they say that eating meat is “animal abuse” abuse is a horrible thing animals should be treated with kindness and respect for they are living beings as well anyone who chooses to treat an animal with cruelty abuse and pain is disgusting  slaughtering animals in order to eat them does not fall into the category of “abuse”  example let’s say there is a cow this cow leads a healthy life with plenty of food water and all it needs to survive once it’s old enough it gets killed in a painless humane way and turned into steak  is that animal abuse the animal was treated humanely and lived a healthy life until it’s final day of course  as people need protein meat is a way to obtain it if we treat the animals humanely it’s okay to eat them in the end  don’t downvote me into hell i’m here for a civil discussion and to possibly have my ideas changed if backed up by solid reasoning although my mind hasn’t been completely changed everyone’s reasoning has led me to think i will now do some personal research and try to form a new opinion i’ll attempt to watch some of the documentaries you’ve recommended to me thank you to everyone who has been respectful with their words",1,274,1527,101,0.04950495049504951
cmv the “my body my choice” slogan for prochoice advocates does not benefit their position because opponents of it do not believe it’s just a woman’s body but that it’s also a child’s life,some people believe life begins at conception some of those people believe ending any life after conception is murder that is not my view that is a prolife view view is that using the phrase “my body my choice” or suggesting that prolife is about controlling women misses the point entirely prolife people don’t just believe it’s “your body and your choice” because it’s not just your body it’s the body and life of a child do believe many prolife and prochoice people could be misogynistic intentionally or unintentionally but i don’t think that it’s necessarily misogynistic to be prolife if you only believe that abortion is murder because life begins at conception i am open to the possibility that there is some angle that makes this simple prolife view hypocritical the record i am prochoice this isn’t an argument about the merits of aborting unwanted babies the morals of late term abortions or the science behind when life begins this is an argument about the intention behind the stance that abortion is murder and the value of the stance that prolife is about controlling women wow so many really great conversations going on here genuinely impressed with reddit this subreddit has to be one of the best out there it’s getting hard to keep up with all the comments but i am still reading as much as i can and replying to some new ideas thanks so much to everyone who has participated here,1,245,1460,193,0.02072538860103627
cmv congresspeople shouldn’t be allowed to trade stocks,cmv congresspeople shouldn’t be allowed to directly own any stocks work for a government agency that regulates utility companies and we aren’t allowed to directly own shares in regulated utilities due to obvious conflict of interest and insider information  we are allowed to own index funds or mutual funds that contain utilities as those are based on broad market conditions and not specifically on those companies in congress have similar conflicts of interest but in pretty much every public ally traded company   understand these statements are pretty broad and those who understand it better than me would need to write up the specifics but in general how can congresspeople not have a conflict of interest if they own shares in companies i didn’t state this clearly before  i’m all for them owning broadly invested funds such as through index or mutual funds my issue is with direct ownership on specific companies that they can directly influence the value of 2 after some very thoughtful comments i now think the solution is requiring they setup blind trusts to manage their funds  it removes the option for insider trading without inhibiting their ability to plan for the future 3 first ever award thank you for the silver 😄,1,211,1287,56,0.07142857142857142
cmv male and female athletes should be paid an equal percentage of their sport’s revenue not necessarily the same absolute dollar amount,controversy in soccer tennis basketball etc highlights that most female athletes make less money than male athletes however they’re often paid similar percentages of the revenue they generate  the inequality is because women’s sports don’t bring in as much revenue  a company made two products one with wide appeal say ice cream and one with more niche appeal say quinoa the company hires salespeople to sell each product and pays everyone 30 commission of course the ice cream salespeople will earn more money because they sell more ice cream because more people want ice cream than quinoa it has nothing to do with who’s a better salesperson it’s just based on their market share no one would say that’s unfair just because they both have the title “salesperson”  if male and female athletes in a given sport are paid the same percentage of their organization’s revenue how is that unfair,1,153,926,139,0.02877697841726619

cmv the sexual assault accusations against biden are a big deal,i cant see why the accusations against biden are any less significant and they are perhaps worse than the accusations against kavanaugh it seems this reality and the timing of the accusations or at least the recent escalation of the accusations are so challenging that the left is not really dealing with them yet or has decided not to deal with them  instead going into circle the wagons mode  so when i say big deal i mean this is something not being discussed much in the left that could lead to a biden losing the election b biden somehow being replaced with another dem  c a last minute third party candidate steps in and gains favorability eg mark cuban  or all of the above  im interested to hear why i have this wrong and why it really isnt that big of a big deal  or if in agreement with my view   what can or should be done at this late stage for those whod prefer not to have trump win by default  ideally it would be great to avoid a lot of i told you so comments since im not arguing a position about who should or shouldnt have been nominated well that escalated quickly  hanks for all of the great comments the analysis and debate among cmvers is so much better than you can get anywhere else i probably owe a few more deltas when i get more time here’s a summary of some highlights so far paraphrasing in italics is different area of this argument that i think is interesting and that i hadn’t thought about urgency  there was an urgency to scrutinize bk’s background none of us knew who bk was rightly or wrongly then suddenly he’s up for a lifetime appointment with gop fasttracking on the back of the merrick garland shenanigan so even to a nonpartisan the need to evaluate ford’s claims and the media’s handling of the issue as something that needed to be urgently discussed seems more reasonable in contrast to biden’s long career in the spotlight and gradual ramping towards president  in general i can give democrats some credit for not having an ideal situation to set the standards for how to look into allegations given that handling the matter in a diligent and measured way was not really an option at the time  holding the media and democrats to the standards set by bkgate true left is treating this as a big deal view on this was partially motivated by the fact that bernie endorsed biden after the allegations were known so while there may be a strong reaction in some sectors of the left the reaction is either not a big deal or it hasn’t been “processed” yet by at least one person on the left who matters in my view witness isn’t credible because of recent behavior completely agree that the accuser may not be credible and commenters pointed at many good issues to look at that said the nyt reported there are 4ish people who corroborate to varying degrees that something did happen in the early 90’s this undermines the idea that the story was recently fabricated  even if the decision to publicize now is dubious i credit the nyt and others for reporting this but the degree to which they are covering her story vs the circumstantial evidence against her credibility seems disproportionate given past precedent i suspect that has to do with the media being under a great deal of scrutiny to defend why they didn’t report on the matter more proactively sooner until proven guilty this view seems to be held by conservatives and liberals the metoo movement has put forward the idea that the conventional methods that we use to determine someone’s guilt or innocence have failed women ie crosby weinstein and these methods need to adapt to take into consideration the power dynamic between accusers and perpetrators the dynamic explains why a victim might continue to have a cordial public relationship with a perpetrator when this type of thing might have formerly have proven a perpetrator ‘not guilty’ whether you agree with this line of thinking on not my assertion is that this belief is held by a large enough number of democrats and that it creates a problem with no easy answers in the biden case 2 not compare biden to trump guess i should explain that i dont think most voters are comparing trump to biden  most voters these days are either in one camp or the other  the right does not seem to care much about sexual misconduct unless it involves a figure that they can use as an example of hypocrisy of the left clinton weinstein etc so i dont think trumps history is that relevant to what i mean by a big deal ie something that could influence the election  it just doesnt really matter what trump does at this point  if he could shoot someone at park avenue and get away with it imagine what he could do to a woman the left does care about it  the bk scandal is symbolic of the standard that the left has set to deal with partiallycorroborated accusations of sexual misconduct from the past against a powerful figure being considered for a high political office so thats why it is relevant in my analysis 3 looks like reades mother may have corroborated her story in the 90s removing another pillar in the reade is a politically motivated hack narrative   i cant reply to every individual post on this but it seems to underscore the misguidedness of assuming ford is automatically credible while reade must be held to a different standard,1,971,5559,65,0.07692307692307693

cmv people who have been wrongfully imprisoned should automatically be compensated for their time in prison to such an extent that they can live a comfortable lifestyle,"the main focus of my stance is people who have served long sentences for serious crimes such as those wrongfully convicted of murder or rape and released decades after their conviction although i would also support some form of compensation for lesser sentences for lesser crimes  but the main focus of this cmv should be those convicted of major crimes such as murder who have spent many years in prison before their release concept we have in american justice is the idea that someone who is sent to prison is paying their debt to society  the premise behind this is that a crime causes harm to society to a whole and having the criminal give up his or her quality of life for some time balance the scales  if said person faced the same punishment without having owned that debt then the reverse must be true society owes them a debt  since it is impossible to give them extra years on their life the next best thing is to make the remaining years they have left as good as possible and financial compensation is the best way to do that job market can be hard enough for anyone let alone someone with a huge gap in their employment history  even if it is understood that the conviction was reversed there may be some employers who may be prejudiced against that person maybe they feel that its possible that they actually were guilty and dont want to hire them  even without such prejudice its hard to imagine a scenario in which a person with 15 years of experience would not get a job over someone who had 15 years of no job experience because they were in prison save for an employer wanting to be charitable   there is the concept of time away from life  think about the things that you enjoy that make life worth living  whether that be time with friends family travelling going to concerts or simply taking a walk outside imagine having years taken from your life where you couldnt do these things  most people spend a large portion of their waking hours working to sustain a lifestyle of these things in their free time  i spend time away from my wife at work so that the time i do get to spend with her after work and on weekends is enjoyable and that we have necessities such as food and shelter  someone who has been wrongfully imprisoned shouldnt have to spend their time doing anything other than trying to make up for lost time  they should be able to spend every day with their family and friends and just relaxing doing things most of us hope to do in retirement maybe theres something i missed if you feel differently see if you can change my view

cmv runpopularopinion is no longer for actually unpopular opinions just hot takes,none of the opinions that make it to the top of runpopularopinion are controversial or unpopular theyre just opinions that nobody really thinks about at first and typically will agree with because they make sense when was the last time you saw an unpopular opinion on that subreddit that you disagreed with  even this post is just a hot take of the subreddit i guarantee what im saying isnt unpopular because its true a good post for this subreddit would be a truly unpopular opinion that few would agree with at first but could either a understand why someone would have the opinion or b be swayed to have a different opinion my unpopular opinion i want to clarify a couple of things when i say hot take im referring to an opinion about a topic that is not widely disagreed with but is simply an opinion that doesnt occur to people very often an example i am using is this post which is currently trending on the subreddit no one would disagree with this opinion but nobody ever thinks to themselves gee those people are weird second thing i want to make clear is that runpopularopinion obviously defines what is popular by what is widely agreed upon by most people the subbredit tells you to upvote what you disagree with and downvote what you agree with the problem with this is that nobody really listens to that rule anyway so you end up with people upvoting posts that they agree with and thus you have posts at the top of the subreddit that are only there because people agree with them also the subbredits sidebar makes it very clear it is a discussion subreddit the problem with that is you cant discuss something you already agree with and just didnt think of before for practical discussion about two different viewpoints to exist there has to be some disagreement and there just is very little of that in runpopularopinion anymore people have suggested sorting the subreddit by controversial to enhance the experience i agree with this but it doesnt really change my view about the subbredit overall being not what its supposed to be,1,365,2235,86,0.03488372093023256
cmv the most efficient way to end police brutality is to make cops criminally liable for their actions on the job and stop funding their legal defense with public money,i think this is the fastest way to reduce incidents of police brutality simply make them accountable the same as everyone else for their choices violent cops had to pay their own legal fees and were held to a higher standard of conduct there would be very few violent cops left on the street in six months system is designed to insulate them against criminal and civil action to prevent frivolous lawsuits from causing decay to civil order but this has led to an even worse problem with an even bigger impact on civil order police unions want to foot the bill let them but stop taking taxpayer money to defend violent cops accused of injuringkilling taxpayers its a broken system that needs to change,1,125,725,170,0.023529411764705882
cmv the leadership of the us republican party is no longer interested in maintaining a fully democratic system,ill start with a disclaimer this post will reference some things trump did but its not about trump directly rather its about the current leadership of the republican party which ill simply refer to as the gop thesis is this the gop has known for some several decades that its voter base is shrinking its response has increasingly been to target the systems and institutions underpinning democracy during the trump presidency at the latest the gop has decided to take the next step and interfere in the elections directly to stay in power gop has known for some decades that demographic trends do not favor its traditional base faced with that there have been repeated debates about whether its appeal needs to broaden however time and again the decision was made to focus on the already highly mobilised core voters rather than try to open up the tea party movement has given the latest big push in that direction the same time political taboos have started falling and it has been the gop leading the push in most cases redmap was a coordinated effort at gerrymandering citizens united was a conservative platform under mitch mcconnell the us senate has become a graveyard of bills a supreme court nomination was held up for months for partisan reasons a president is in office backed by the gop who openly calls the election into question has instated a personal friend with no obvious qualifications at the head of the postal service and is suggesting his supporters try voter fraud to see if the system is really safe a president who is already on record soliciting foreign aid in his reelection by their continued support the gop is all but openly admitting that they do not care about the integrity of the election i am not suggesting the gop will set up trump as a dictator on november 4th but neither will they accept the result of the election they will do what they think they can get away with until they have a grip on power thats no longer dependant on actual votes i dont know whether they already know what their preferred end result looks like but it does seem to me that genuine respect for democracy no longer features in it,1,380,2212,112,0.05357142857142857
cmv waving the confederate flag is more disrespectful to the american flag than kneeling during the national anthem,this post probably isn’t for people who don’t think kneeling is disrespectful to the flag to begin with but i feel there is a portion of the us population in the south that is adamant that you must stand for the national anthem but are also partial to displaying the confederate flag the argument about what kneeling is really about has probably been in numerous other posts some still believe it’s an insult to the american flag as well as the us military despite it being made clear the protest is not about the flag or the military people still think that performing the protest during the anthem and while the flag is specifically on display is disrespectful regardless of the intention this regard any display of the confederate flag other than in a completely unambiguously historical context is far more disrespectful to the american flag than kneeling is flying the confederate flag as a source of pride even if it’s just pride of your own ancestry is demonstrating that you are proud of a side that fought against what the current flag stands for now it’s not to be confused with a state flag or anything like that it’s a flag that specifically represents a way of life that the current flag is against don’t necessarily want this to turn into an argument that the confederate flag isn’t about slavery my case is that the confederate flag clearly represents a time when the country was divided and the confederate side lost so still flying a confederate flag shows a continued act of divisiveness towards other americans when the argument is that the american flag is a sign of unity it would be similar to claiming you’re flying the union jack flag to show american patriotism the union jack and confederate flag both represent losing sides of attempts to make america into something different than what it is now so any claim to have pride in those flags is not american pride or patriotism which is indirect conflict with true american patriotism and therefore disrespectful to the idea of what the american flag represents mentioned above i’m perfectly fine with anything being represented in an historical context history is crucial and required for education but there’s a pretty clear distinction between historical representation and what i’m talking about so i’d rather not use this post to debate historical relevance that if you think kneeling is disrespectful to the american flag then you should also think flying the confederate flag is disrespectful to the american flag and even more so,1,429,2562,117,0.042735042735042736

i believe that overweight or even underweight people should very much be part of the body positive movement and should remain that way however they should not be the figurehead of the movement as a whole i have found before many people use the body positive movement as a excuse for not striving to change their bmi or their possibly fatal circumstances a persons body weight as i have found can at the very least be helped the other hand people who do not have control over their circumstances with their own body someone with down syndrome or people with other visible disabilities beyond their control etc often are not seen as a major part of the movement despite needing the support that the movement has to offer  know this has flaws but i would like to know an opposing view on the matter",1,145,820,124,0.024193548387096774
cmv wap by cardi b and megan thee stalion is not an anthem of female empowerment and is instead just sinking to the same lows that maleproduced hiphop has been criticized for for years,"edit right so ive been at it on and off for like 12hrs at this point gonna call it a wrap for the night thanks for the awesome conversation thanks for the awards thanks to the mods for all their ongoing hard work keeping this thread clean and thanks to those who shifted my view if youre looking to get in on the discussion id recommend jumping in on an existing chain rather than leaving a top level comment as im pretty swamped and cant promise a reply also if you think im a racist or a sexist id love to hear some specifics on why you think that got a lot of accusations along those lines but they were invariably short on the details when asked ill try to get back in the am thanks all not a lot of dog in this fight im not a huge hiphop or rap fan these days and what i do listen to is fairly underground  far from the poppy variant of this song i just became aware of this debate and thought id chime in with my view here also add a large part of why im so selective about the hiphop i do listen to is because more than any other genre it is prone to making incredibly crass and demeaning statements about women or hosting an unhealthy obsession over sex without love as well as drug use violence and all sorts of unhealthy harmful and negative themes more than any other genres hip hop and rap are an absolute minefield of misogyny and all sorts of other shitty behaviors something they have been criticized for for a long time color me surprised when a song comes out made by women in the industry and follows all those same negative demeaning sexist tropes and is for some reason folks hail it as the epitome of female empowerment or claim apparently without a trace of irony or satire that surely the epitome of modern feminism is women rapping about the selflubricating prowess of their vaginas mean what the fuck guys i encourage you to review the lyrics of the song as well as the music video and ask yourself if these are signs of female empowerment or good things generally some various themes the song touches on it refers to women as whores
 it seems largely based on the idea of being proud of a well lubricated vagina something many women struggle with
 it glorifies sugar babygold digger culture in which women trade sex for money or gifts
 it seems to promote unprotected either from pregnancy or stds sex
 it preferences tight vaginas and large penises which seems to be a form of body shaming both men and women who dont conform to these ideals
 it demeans men who engage in certain sexual acts with women
 it seems to shame women who might prefer a more traditional role in relationships or a more traditional view of sex
 it presents women and female body parts as sex objects on and on and on various people promoting this track as the epitome of female empowerment  nay  the epitome of all of modern feminism seem to be painfully unaware that their own promotion of frankly cringingly sexist drivel is the reason why so many people are critiquing the song instead they chalk up all critiques of it to the usual suspects misogyny racism religion the patriarchy etc but also go so far as to somehow fit colonialism fgm trump freud and faked orgasms into the blame game i pointed out male produced hiphop and rap has long been critiqued for its sexism and objectification and shallow presentation of sexual interaction so very obviously that critique of maledominated rap exists without people penning articles calling incredibly sexist and demeaning maleproduced rap or hiphop songs the epitome of male empowerment and claiming body shaming objectification unprotected sex etc are good things the way the various folks championing wap have with that track other words people already flip shit about the very crass and dehumanizing themes in maleproduced hiphop when these themes are appropriated into femaleproduced hiphop and countless woke progressives are tripping over themselves to laud it as amazing and awesome and the epitome of triumphs of all feminism those same people seem utterly unable to think of any reason why they and the song might get some criticism other than they must hate strong black women because of colonialism and trump what the fuck guys dont get it if a man had made a parallel track it might have already been subject to harsh critiques for being so misogynistic if it had simultaneously been widely praised for that misogyny it would have drawn even harsher criticism which is exactly what seems to have happened here also rather flabbergasted by the mental gymnastics and doublethink employed to complain that black female artists in hiphop are often degraded and hypersexualized or that our bodies are hypersexualised and plastered everywhere while simultaneously heaping an astounding amount of praise on a video and song that degrades and hypersexualizes female bodies fuck that video is raunchy enough to be softcore porn it almost invariably far surpasses any of the hypersexualization youd see on beer billboards or in car commercials or on any superbowl cheerleading squad or in any film raked over the coals for having a male gaze in all it seems to me that far from empowering women or fighting against objectification or being the hallmark of modern feminism all wap has done is sink to the lowest of the most egregious lows in all those regards encouraged a bunch of people to wax over how awesome that is and then have those same people act totally shocked when they get some pushback for it my view",1,971,6290,189,0.0582010582010582

cmv demilitarize the police makes more sense as a slogan than defund the police,the classic rationale for defunding the police is that they shouldnt need armored vehicles and the latest military gear to enforce law and order sure but the vibe of defund means that you are going to restrict polices access to money in general  money that can be spent on training for nonlethal deescalation methods clearly we are not as concerned about the polices access to public funds in general as we are of the manner in which they spend those funds would we not want a police department that splurges on educating their officers on saving lives second rationale is that police arent supposed to do the jobs of social workers or therapists maybe but we can already see that in places like the uk and south korea police officers are entirely capable of being friendly neighborhood guardians that are able to work closely with the community while still retaining an authority role of course doesnt take into consideration that perhaps the police need to be militarized to deal with armed violence in certain communities perhaps in that case a demilitarization of american society at large is in order there are way too many replies now to respond to all of them but thanks for the engagement,1,208,1317,84,0.047619047619047616

cmv the modern remakes of older disney movies the new or upcoming beauty and the beast jungle book lion king aladdin mulan etc have never been exciting or good or hypeworthy and reflect a complete bankruptcy of creativity as well as a sickening cynical and blatant greed on disney’s part,edit okay so this post gained a lot more traction than i was expecting i woke up to over 150 replies and thats obviously more than i can realistically be expected to engage with i want to thank the redditors who actually took the time to come up with a thoughtful response either to the original post or one of my followup comments and there were plenty of you who offered good points that did change my viewpoint so ill be awarding deltas when i get time there were also plenty who did not afford me such a courtesy however one redditor went so far as to claim that i should be put on medication because i disagree with their opinion obviously worthless comments like this are a dime a dozen on reddit but i wanted to focus on this one because as unconstructive as it is i dont know if the commenter realized how hilariously dystopian their suggestion was you dont buy into the hype for lion king 2019 better drug yourself so you fit in with what my vision of a society is sorry to hear my opinion about kids movies about talking animals is such an affront to you that i need to change my brains chemistry to appease you sire on this note i also think people have misinterpreted how ardently care about this topic i dont lay awake at night cursing the disney company because they made remakes of my childhood movies and replying to my original post with a response that implies that i take it that seriously is founded on false premises perhaps i worded my original title too negatively because i dont care that much what my overall point was was that i dont buy into the hype edit most common arguments i see in support of seeing these remakes produced have been 1 makes me nostalgic 2 it’s what we love but made with better effects  production value 3 it’s like a shakespeare play we haven’t seen this version of x story and here’s why i think each of those arguments completely fails yeah that’s exactly the point disney knows it makes you nostalgic and that’s why they’ve chosen these properties not because they want to create greater art than the original but because they know they have a guaranteed market before they even start preproduction this argument to me is just all kinds of infuriating the transformers films had “better effects” than the tv show doesn’t mean they weren’t steaming piles of garbage surprise surprise one of the most powerful and wealthiest corporations in all history can make a technically competent product i bet i could make a halfway decent movie if i had several billion dollars not to mention  was anybody watching the original lion king in theaters and thinking “wow this is great but i wish all the lions were photorealistic and impossible to distinguish by their faces so we have to rely on their voices” the medium of 2d animation worked so well for those films why spend millions and millions of dollars remaking them with different animation answer they know people will pay to see it i think all the changes they have typically made between the original and the modern remakes have been 100 for the worse from my standpoint but 100 for the safer from a marketing standpoint eg instead of the beast from beauty and the beast being a beast he’s like a tall muscly guy with a hairy face in the cartoon he was an actual monster not unlike a bearwolf hybrid but this was more palatable in the 3d animation medium to marketers  post submissions are characterlimited and i’m not that eloquent or intelligent so i’ll stop here but for any more context regarding my opinions check out any of lindsay ellis’ videos about new disney remakes particularly her beauty and the beast review as i agree with almost everything she brings up ,1,666,3799,298,0.04697986577181208
cmv taxes are not equal to theft they are the cost to of being a part of society,firstly i just want to clarify that my view is held for free and democratic countries i understand that this view might not be true for all countries   often hear the argument that taxes are immoral because taxation is theft taxation is theft because you have to pay your taxes or people with guns put you in a cage this is presented as if there is no other option however if you wanted to you could go out in the wilderness and sustain yourself build your own house live outside of society anyone who does this wouldnt be making any money and therefore wouldnt pay any taxes but would be foregoing all of the privileges of being a part of society  might then make the argument that the taxes that you pay might be used for things that you dont want them used for this is however not criticism towards taxation but rather a political issue  my example of going out into the wilderness and sustaining yourself is nothing more than an example i don’t know how hard it would be or what it would take to actually escape society but i believe it’s very doable  ,1,202,1109,83,0.04819277108433735
cmv if its okay for some people to believe in god then its okay for other people to believe in ghosts werewolves and vampires,"theres no objective proof for the existence any of these god ghosts werewolves or vampires this post on aita people are calling op crazy for believing in ghosts and yet if people hadnt been believing in gods for many centuries and suddenly today some dude started talking about an allpowerful being who created the universe theyd be laughed out of the room i dont believe in the existence of any of those but if god can exist without us having any proof of their existence why cant all sorts of other magical creatures logically why is it okay for us to make fun of someone consider someone crazy for believing in ghosts and other supernatural creatures but not for believing in god edit and angels other than the fact that the existence of god has been normalized in society over several centuries
 see text stuckthrough above tldr im saying that if you arent considering someone crazy for believing in god you shouldnt consider someone else crazy for believing in other supernatural creatures either seeing as there is an equal amount of proof or lack thereof for the existence of both
 to be clearer the intent of the post was to point out that if you call people who believe in ghosts without proof crazy you should call people who believe in god without proof crazy too i just wasnt able to come up with this phrasing till long after id made the post",1,243,1554,131,0.03816793893129771
cmv saying things like “men are trash” or “fuck white people” is not okay just because it’s towards privileged demographics,"i’m a bi white gal and i’ve recently been a lot in online circles for lesbians and bisexual women in there jokes about men being stupid and assholes and yes trash are pretty prevalent elsewhere too for that matter  always catch me off guard why is it okay to say things like these when the opposite would be highly looked down upon and the same when it comes to race they’re basically reinforcing the mindset they’re opposed to it’s what person’s skin color or gender happens to be that matters and it’s okay to make generalizations based on that  could say that historically men have oppressed women and white people have oppressed other races and continue to do so and that that makes it justifiable but are you not basically doing a hitler then it’s the group the individual happens to be born apart of and their ancestors that matters not their own personality and actions  also not american or from an english speaking country and i’ve mostly seen this on the englishspeaking part of the internet even though it’s debatable if the majority of it is native speakers from english speaking countries so feel free to tell me if this is a cultural thing

 i would like to preface that i have not completely changed my view i have become more sympathetic towards such statements  we all do bad shit once in a while and “bad” is a scale not black and white  my understanding that deltas are not only for “ok i have 100 converted now” 2 the “doing a hitler” was below the belt i apologize",1,274,1556,124,0.03225806451612903

cmv the anime community is the reason why most normal people cant bring them self to watch anime,"as a teen i watched anime im a twenty year old on reddit it sould be self explanotary after a while i started to seek out people and communities on the internet that would share that interest and one of the very first things i saw was a guy talking about how good pedofilia in anime was the worst part is that most comments supported him in his belief are a lot of stereotypes that relate to anime watchers or at least nerds in general and the anime community does nothing to separate them self from it i can remember a video by some big anime youtuber i dont remember his name but he had a few hundred thousand subscribers that was basically him talking about how drawing porn of underage girls was okay because they were just drawings  lets not talk about pedofilia so much so a lot of anime fans are really sexist like actually to a ridiculous extent anime is generally targeted towards teen boys so it doesnt make that much effort to develop or explore female characters keep in mind that im not talking about every single show im just saying that it is defintly a common thing so a lot of anime fans treat woman like most anime treats its female characters that is to say with little to no respect for specific examples just suggest that your are a girl on one of the numerous message boards you will be floded with ever flavour of sexism there is last problem doesnt seem like the worst but it essentially creates ever other problem the elitism  there are many kinds of elitism that anime fans like my favorite show is better than yours you are enjoyingnot enjoying an anime i dislikelike and there for i a a better person  you are not allowed to watch this specific show because something sexistrasist most probably and of course as if you would even understand i feel like i dont have to go in depth with this one the over the top examples show exactly how i feel problem is that i like anime id even would co side my self a fanweb if not for the community and id love to recommend shows like evangelion beastars cowboy beebop fullmeatl alchemist brotherhood jojos etc but i know that i will get the weird looks from them  clarify i am not saying that every single anime fan is like this just that a majority is like that i know that the loud minority allways makes the entire group look bad but in this case its often hard to find people who are not exactly like the weeb stereotypes okay i had a lot of conversation with lots of people never expected for this to get so big overnight so writing a comment would be pretty pointless since i generally agree with you i also think that it is because of anime it self rather than just the community that most people are turned off by  also like to say that beastars whole extremely good in my opinion  is a really bad example of an anime that you could recommend to an average person lol
i also forgot to mention that id already consider most anime to be not that good not that the people who watch it are bad but that the show them self make me cringe 2 i feel like i learned quite a bit on the topic and i discovered a plethora of reasons why people dont like anime i know it sounds silly many people dont like animation many people find anime to be too over the top many anime courses people to become  these shitty fans rather then the opposite sometimes its just ignorance and not wanting to read subtitleswatch a foreign film i also now realise that i was talking about a small vocal minority rather than the larger whole and while i love to argue more a big majority of you were kind and understanding while discussing i have switched my view point so there isnt really a point to it so im not going to respond to further arguments i will also give deltas to people who persuaded me thanks",1,714,3908,98,0.030612244897959183

cmv religious american conservatives  right wingers obsession with capitalism and other amercian values is incompatible with their nearly fundamentalist take on christianity,"im gonna focus on some key principles that i think are important in christianity but are basically ignored by some religious amercian conservatives when they argue against things like healthcare welfare immigration or in favor of guns or military intervention and death penalty punishment in general im genuinely interested in how the worldview of these people is 

 main thing i base my assumptions on are known facts about jesus himself  how he is characterized and how he should be a role model for christians everyone knows that he is supposed to be nice peaceful selfless altruistic helping others and not interested in financial gain or profit i believe he was quoted in saying something like dont praise the money 
 then if you praise this person and act like you live according to his standards why would you be so obsessed with bashing every government program that is about helping poor people they not only reject any step in that direction they also enthusiastically argue against it how can you justify the everybody on his own attitude that people who get sick either die or become homeless because of hospital bills and blame them for their life choices instead of trying to set up a system that would help them even if it would mean that some amount of the money you worked for would go to somebody else shouldnt you as a religious person be okay with it wouldnt it be fitting your narrative of having tried to do the noble thing 

 issue is the tribalism that you find in these communities where there is prejudice and scepticism if non white people are immigrating to their country not only because letting in immigrants seeking a better life would be helping others which would totally be a jesus thing to do but also because jesus himself probably wasnt white he was middle eastern so how do they justify their narrow focus on people with european ancestry when their role model wasnt that

 next topic is their stance on guns and military intervention i assume that jesus would have been a pacifist so why do you never hear those people complain about military spending and all the interventions they are doing do they think jesus would be in favor of going to war with a country like vietnam or having coup detats in south amercia correct me if im wrong but as far as i know they are mostly in favor of military operations of the us and are very sceptic about people who critique anything relating to the troops right and what is with the obsession with guns in their culture do they think that jesus would be a gun guy and a nra supporter that he also would talk happily about how home invaders deserve instant death and how important these tools are which only have the purpose of hurting  killing regardlessof how you judge the home invader situation i think as a religious person you shouldnt be that enthusiastic about homicide no matter how much the person deserved it or how much you thought its justified even if it is necessary for your survival the way some people talk about this with this non mercy attitude as if they are just waiting to shoot someone is completely the opposite of christianity
 last point is their stance towards punishment  death penalty its obvious what the contradiction in regards to the death penalty would be but also the punishment over rehabilitation stance that they take feels so wrong do you really think that for example jesus as a judge would be okay with locking up somebody for stealing as much as possible instead of trying to rehabilitate this person  why would you as a christian put revenge over forgiveness im not even a christian and i think it would be obvious which one is the christian way and which not so why do these people dont see it


 summary i believe that these people dont really care about christianity they use it when it fits them but abandon it when it would do something that doesnt fit their amercian narrative because in my opinion these contradictions are too big to ignore so either you are intentionally ignorant or they dont really believe in christianity",1,720,4190,179,0.027932960893854747
cmv the biggest issue facing the lgbtq community is itself and it’s full of toxic non inclusive insecure people that gatekeep personality and sexuality,i’m a bisexual man that tends to lean more towards guys and in the past few days can recount multiple separate negative interactions i’ve had with other gay guys  girls obviously this is a small sample size below but ive had more negative experiences with lgbtq people than positives as i’ve been an open member of this community for more than a year and have made many gay friends  acquaintances i feel i have fair grounds to comment on its toxicity these are the three most recent experiences i’ve had and the issues i have with them extreme body shaming  bullying — this is a big one i’ve suffered from anorexia in my life and am currently 6’3 muscular and sitting at 210 lbs i was in a discord call with a couple people for league clash tonight one gay while we start posting pictures of ourselves comparing ourselves to league of legends champions due to my hairstyle i posted myself next to sett i was immediately told by the gay guy that i look nothing like “sett daddy” and was called fatty and told to “tone up and drop some more pounds” unoffended at this point i informed him i used to be 300 lbs with no muscle until i was bullied into developing anorexia and only recovered like 6 months ago his response was “should’ve kept going you ain’t anywhere near a snack rn” this cut pretty deep especially when the community preaches “inclusivity”  i’m apparently a fake gay if i’m bisexual and use it for sympathy and i’m not allowed to be “straight acting” — an irl acquaintance i was speaking to during a zoom meeting noticed an lgbt flag hanging in the back of my room she exclaimed “omg uspeculatory i had no idea you were gay” and i clarified “well actually no haha i’m bisexual” i was then bombarded with accusations of “cultural appropriation” and “sympathy seeking” as i was “clearly a straight man from how i act” again it seems odd for a community that is supposed to be all inclusive to degrade me for how i act and who i love  extreme sexualization  gay is a personality trait — during the same clash game as in  one of my close friends had his little brother 8 years old in the room and was playing league on speakers since he had to watch him the gay guy died in lane and starts moaning and saying “this rengar just raped my boy pussy oooh” and other stuff my close friend tells him to shut up because his 8 year old brother is in the room and gay guy immediately calls me friend a “homophobic fuckboy” and says he’s probably “closeted” and should come over and try some “boy pussy” at this point my close friend left the call and gay guy resumes with his extremely hyper sexualized remarks during a video game there’s a fine line between being yourself and just being extremely vulgar to the point where your presence offends and shocks a group of 20 year olds  i’ve said these aren’t one time occurrences — similar situations to those above have happened at least half a dozen times each to me personally from different people i can’t say i’m proud to be part of a community that is built entirely on drama sex and appearance,1,570,3118,156,0.057692307692307696
cmv removing tv episodes or movies from streaming because of racist content does nothing to combat racism and only serves to shield the creators’ brand,"edit y’all actually went and changed my view while i do think there needs to be a legal resource for accessing these episodes digitally just in the interest of transparency it should only exist for research purposes the episodes should be taken out of popular circulation because the risk of people seeing and absorbing the ideology is too high i forget that new people discover shows like 30 rock every day and may not question the content 
end of edit  is something that i would actually like to change my mind about but i just can’t bring myself to because i really don’t understand it is spurred on by the removal of a few episodes of 30 rock and the golden girls from all streaming i don’t really care about what happened with gone with the wind i think they actually did the right thing there by adding a disclaimer instead of removing the film altogether country has a long and pervasive history of racist media we all recognize this we likely haven’t seen the end of racist media either it’s going to happen again with something very popular in the future those episodes of 30 rock aired were beloved by millions of people won emmys and were racist we can’t ignore that removing them from all digital platforms feels more like an attempt to protect tina fey robert carlock and jane krakowski than it does an actual constructive effort to improve media  episodes should be available for the public so they can see what the creators did and recognize how they’ve been complicit in racist media putting a disclaimer or content warning on the episode would be a much better way to communicate how your mind has changed  if they’re really that ashamed take the entire show down by removing select racist content but allowing other episodes to stay tina fey is continuing to profit off 30 rock’s legacy one that was built using racism allowing people to enjoy and support 30 rock without acknowledging it’s racist history is an attempt to absolve future fans of guilt and coddle them assuring them that their problematic fav isn’t actually problematic it’s not productive for the people who love the show or anyone hurt by it",1,378,2206,153,0.0392156862745098

cmv the big bang theory is the worst popular tv show of the last 20 years at least,this may seem subjective but i think there are enough objective reasons that the big bang theorybbt is terrible for some reference here is a list of some very highly rated tv shows from the past couple decades deadwood breaking bad sopranos its always sunny some real high quality stuff quality obviously isnt always directly reflected in ratings however in terms of popularity and viewership bbt has been consistently the top program of the year occasionally behind the superbowl and a few other football events and that is well into its12 year run 78 10 years in bbts popularity is easy and objective how to demonstrate its terribleness it is my opinion that the show is not funny at all but it is objectively offensive and insulting to basically everyone not only that but there is no character growth mainly because the characters themselves are designed to only be shallow caricatures in the first place attractive people are dumb slutspenny zach smart people are gawky wierdos who creep out women all the males on the show smart women are frumpy wierdosamy  go thru the cast real quick doesnt even have a last name is attractive and therefore dumb and promiscuous has 0 personality once her relationship is established with leonard she becomes nothing but an obnoxious harpy who hates everything and complains about all of it he is short and smart therefore weird and awkward he is obsessed with the girl next door because she is hot and no other reason he is a doormat for sheldon yet for some reason because the writers said so he enables him and stays with him  a complete nightmare of a human being he is clearly autistic but it is all just for laughs no sane person would maintain a relationship of any kind with him yet for some reason he manages to keep 7 people wrapped around his finger by acting like a child smart so a creepy weirdo the only character that actually has a bit of an arc ill get to that smart so a creepy wierdo so creepy and weird he literally cant speak to women until alcohol touches his lips this goes on until the writers realize the show is getting more popular and need a few more women and they just cure him smart so a frumpy wierdo comes out of her shell a little but doesnt actually develop gets a phd so must be smart a weirdo and controlling shrew made to be horrible since she is at least moderately attractive not smart but likes comic books so a creepy wierdo this show has a character or character trait that is portrayed in  a negative light that can offend or at least insult basically everyone hot girls smart people dumb people men women nerds geeks autistic people etc not to go too long but character arc spoiler this show doesnt have any sheldon remains his horrible abusive self despite getting married and having sex leonard is still an obnoxious whiner obsessed with the hottie who has nothing in common with him penny is still a dumb nagging narcissist amy is still a frumpy wierdo she just talks more about how she has friends and sex bernadette is a horrible shrew and raj is a creepy weirdo as i mentioned howard gets a bit of an arc as he actually does become a slightly more real person and less creepy weirdo after getting married but it is a pretty flat arc compare this to the arcs in a good show like breaking bad and you see just how pathetic it is that 12 seasons of bbt gives us basically 0 character development relatively minor point but i will mention it anyway all the relationships are terrible sheldon abuses amy constantly no surprise he abuses everyone penny and leonard have nothing in common and spend most of the time complaining about each other to their friends and howard and bernadette argue about everything never communicate and also have nothing in common point the show is not funny harder to prove but when i watch my favorite comedies like 30 rock parks n rec the office scrubs archer always sunny the it crowd south park letterkenny and venture bros i laugh out loud multiple times per episode even after watching them many times i have seen most episodes of bbt probably thru season 10 over 200 episodes and i actually laughed 56 times total watch the nolaugh track edit and see that it is not so much jokes as people saying things then pausing for laugh track compare that with actually funny shows that usually dont need a laugh track and you will see that bbt is just not funny big bang theory is not funny has offensive and shallow characters yet was incredibly popular either convince me that it is actually good or that there is another popular show that was even more terrible wtf is up with the links 2 i should have specified that i am only talking about scripted shows as reality tv is by definition complete trash while no reality tv is as popular as bbt it is certainly just as bad,1,871,5526,85,0.03529411764705882

than just insults etc 2 thanks again for all the replies please forgive me if you’ve written out a detailed response and i haven’t responded to it it was a bit overwhelming to wake up from a short nap to find 80 replies to try to discuss im terms of what ‘changed my mind’ it’s a strange one because my actual point probably comes across as a little blurry rather than specifically cmv the majority of the replies helped me to feel less annoyed i still feel annoyance at the inconsistency of world outrage but this has been abated somewhat now that it’s been explained exactly why this is the case  has been stewing in my mind for a few days now and its finally started to pss me off with the blackedout instagram gimmick today  firstly i am naturally completely aghast at the recent killing of george floyd a view which is almost completely unanimous across the western world the method and reporting of the riotsprotests isnt part of my cmv so ill avoid ranting about that  what is grinding my gears is the sudden outrage that appears to have suddenly sprung up in the last day or two in countries outside of the us floyd was killed on the 25th the news spread quickly to my home country of the uk and then the subsequent rioting spread even quicker it has taken until june for the social media virtue signallers to start point scoring and within a day it had caught hold and now everyone single post on facebook instagram and twitter is fellow white people trying to outdo each other on who can be the most antiracist  current hotandhappening trendy thing to do among young people is to go on a protest march and how else will your friends know that youre not racist unless you blackout your facebook picture you instagram story and your wallpaper at home everyone is doing it you wouldnt want to be uncool would you  like people simply didnt care that much until their friend their flavour of the month celebrity or their favourite sports team started posting selfpromoting patontheback slacktivism yes everyone knows your in solidarity everyone is in solidarity weve seen the video once again the whole western world is in solidarity by default because someone was just murdered its not black and white pun not intended i akmost certain that the vast majority of people outside of the us will have seen the news story thought about how horrifically unjust it was and then gone back to scrolling through their phoneslaptops  one half of my annoyance the mediamanifactured outrage around the world  that leads onto my main issue why is there such a deafening silence when it comes to arguably for more horrific actual genocide and repression of ethnic minorities in other countries im mainly referring to the crises of the rohingya muslims and chinese uighurs although i have no doubt theres others calling these issues worse may be controversial but im not here to sugar coat 9 unarmed black men were killed by cops in the us in 2019 thats 9 too many and of course there are deep lying racial issues that go beyond police brutality but thats hardly comparible to village massacres and concentration camps  firmly believe that the media simply doesnt want us to care about those issues because theyre not as attractive to report about compared to heating up the pressure cooker and getting free news stories from a good old percieved race war on the home turf i can probably count on one hand the amount of uighur or rohingyarelated news coverage or social media activism ive seen over the years because how are you going to score internet bonus points with your friends when they have no idea who the uighurs are right the last time i can remember any sort of mass outrage over this kind of issue outside the western world was the kony 2012 hysteria and that only lasted for a week why was everyone incensed yep because the media told us it was the cool thing to do at the time  counter argument ive seen to all this is well we cant really change bad countrys mind and while this is perhaps true the same is true for the current situation the us wont listen to years of pressure from its own citizens what the hell makes you think theyll even remotely care about your small protest in new zealand or the netherlands or your random english sports team staging a selfmasturbatory pr picture with all the players kneeling to this someone will probably reply its all about solidarity about awareness ok then surely everyone should want to show solidarity and awareness with the rohingya crisis if its that easy  dont even know what to think at this point am i annoyed at the currents riotsprotests for getting too much insipid support from people who only want to care because it benefits them in some way or am i more annoyed the other atrocities dont get the time of day in the media because theyre not as trendy as racism police brutality and f the system for the incredibly long post i didnt realise how much i was writing i probably couldve waffled and ranted for many more pages  want to change my mind im becoming increasingly cynical day by day and worrying its starting to make me turn a bit sour to the whole racist police cause as a

cmv if republicans do not support abortion or birth control then they should be supporting social programs to help families raise children,"i know that the topics of abortion and birth control are very sensitive topics for people to discuss especially here on this subreddit but the main issue i see with these topics is what should be allowed for women to do if they cannot care for a child that may come about from having intercourse with someone in politics as the issues have come up republicans have seemed to come to the conclusion that both birth control and abortion are either immoral or a form of murder im stating both because these are the most common arguments i see themselves i can understand these arguments i mean i understand wanting to give babies a chance at life but they also contradict with the fact that conservatives also generally do not support social welfare programs in general but that opposition also includes not supporting initiatives to help families care for children there are many different programs different countries have done such as maternity leave healthcare reforms centered around birth care subsidies to assist with childrearing cost etc these are usually government forms of assistance but there is also intense opposition to private attempts to help families with these issues planned parenthood is the first thing that comes to mind but there are probably other good examples tldr what am i saying ive noticed that conservatives do not support birth control or abortion but also refuse to help cover the costs of the children that result from the lack of access to these even when families cannot afford the children they are essentially forced to have like to see some justification for this or just some sort of explanation for why they should keep up this mess of contradictions in us politics im just going to say this because its coming up alot in the comments below what i am getting at is republicans are generally against interfering with what a person does in their lives but they seem to violate that in trying to restrict abortion so i am saying that if they are willing to intefere in someones life because of that they should be willing to help cover the costs associated with that prevention

cmv euthanasia should be legal because we deserve the dignity of a peaceful death  long term suffering,in my opinion adults who are competent eg conscious doesnt have alzheimers sober should be allowed to elect euthanasia as a solution for intense and long lasting suffering its more inhumane to make people suffer for years especially to illnesses like cancer rather than have a peaceful death on their own terms  noncompetent adults eg long term comas severe alzheimers otherwise compromised their caregivers should be allowed to make that choice as well if the prognosis is continued suffering and deterioration to an eventual death they should be allowed to elect euthanasia in their care receivers best interests  think this could extend to children as well if your child is born with severe disabilities or diseases eg cancer sma born very prematurely in some cases it would be more moral to put the child to a peaceful death rather than raise them watch them suffer and eventually deal with their prolonged death in some cases a child might live in a hospital bed their whole life this isnt a life but rather a parentally enforced existence i understand this is probably my most contentious point but i feel strongly about it  aforementioned examples would obviously be counselled and performed by a medical professional in all we dont choose to come into this life we might as well get the choice on how weincapable wards leave it  context im female atheist prochoice and from the us  all conscious patients should be included in the decision even if young or severely disabled in cases of severe disability the explanation would need to be accessible and comprehensive to the patients capability levels im still on the fence on the cases like severe alzheimers or mental impairment where they cant make other legal decisions like will changes or getting a license and how that would be balanced with their wellbeing people with severe mental illnessesemotional disabilities should be allowed to go through this process as well under supervision of medical and therapy professionals their suffering is real too,1,339,2118,104,0.038461538461538464
cmv comedy should not be exclusively pc everyone needs to get poked fun at sometimes no limits,"this all came to a head when dave chapelle was getting shit for his netflix sticks and stones special great foresight on the title people bitch too much the show was a thought provoking and fresh change in the sea of boring airplane food type jokesroutines going around comedians are the ones that call out the bullshit in our society jokes cannot exist without an element of truth and often reveal to you the fucked up shit we deal with daily the humor is only offensive to you specifically and dragging everyone down because your fragile feelings got hurt is a shitty thing to do humor does not give a shit please do not have a stick up your ass as this makes you unlikable and a buzzkill imo
 comedy is a medium to help us grapple with the complex and often disappointing depressingnot fun realities we face in the world and the pc police staunching it over trivial things has gone too far and is not helpful comedy makes you think about why the joke was funny and the elements of truth and fiction in the joke people who want to police jokes are the disillusioned ones who dont want to face the truth and the music beauty of comedy is that anything flies for laughs it is self policing its the responsibility of the comedian or joke teller to analyze his audience demographic and based upon that alter the severity of the joke if a joke went to far nobody laughs and that to me is beautiful urge all to check the delta post very good breakdown comedians should either shit on everyone by the same amount or delve into controverisal topics and use jokes to explore them with the audience bigots pretending to be comedians with their circle jerk audience should not be allowed if your special focuses on the jewish for the entire hour and only trashes and does not meaningfully explore its not comedy its being a cock that being said nobody is untouchable and somebody shouldnt cry and bitch if they were offended from 3 minutes out of a 1 hour show",1,358,2018,98,0.08163265306122448
cmv the biggest problem with american politics is viewing people that we disagree with as the enemy,it appears to me that weve gotten to a point where liberals and conservatives hate each other with such passion that those who disagree with us are seen as the enemy the internet for all of the great it has brought us has led our society to a state of hyperpolarization users can now consume only information that comports with their worldview and thus the hatred towards the other side has grown exponentially this has led friends neighbors family members and worst of all congress to view those who disagree with them as evil this has many ramifications in our political discourse such as a constant state of gridlock can not think of a single issue which prevents our society from moving forward as much as the pervasive attitude that those who disagree with us are the enemy my view,1,140,821,103,0.04854368932038835

cmv we are going to have to come up with a better term than lgbtqia,when i was young the word gay meant anyone with a samesex orientation then gay acquired more of a connotation of just gay men so instead of just gay rights  people started referring to gay and lesbian rights to be more inclusive then i still remember the day in college that our oncampus chapter of glaad was renamed bglaad to include people with a bisexual orientation shortly after that because the discrimination trans people face is similar in a lot of ways we shifted again to lgbt which is still pretty easy to say and most people even those outside the community knew what all the letters stood for and what groups they represented  now its evolved to lgbtqia which is only three syllables shorter than antidisestablishmentarianism the longest word in the english language most people saying it bog down around the q as they struggle to remember how the rest of it goes and even when they get there theyre not exactly sure what the letters stand for or what groups they represent worst of all im sure were still not representing everyone who feels like part of the community are we just going to keep on adding letters indefinitely and to me at least the current term isnt egalitarian within the movement rather the groups listed first are always included while those at the end have a tackedon feel and are sometimes omitted implying they are less important in a community so damaged already by marginalization wouldnt a more egalitarian term be better term ive heard proposed is gsm for gender and sexual minorities which accomplishes a lot of the goals here but which has never really caught on but i think were now at that breaking point where we have to come up with something better than what we currently have change my view,1,309,1818,71,0.15492957746478872
cmv transwomen transitioned postpuberty shouldnt be allowed in womens sports,from all that i have read and watched i do feel they have a clear unfair advantage especially in explosive sports like combat sports and weight lifting and a mild advantage in other sports like running all things outside sports i do think there shouldnt be such an issue like using washrooms etc this is not an attack on them being women they are there is no denying that and i support every transwoman who wants to be accepted as a women think we have enough data to suggest that puberty affects bone density muscle mass fasttwich muscles etc hence the unfair advantage even if they are suppressing their current levels of testosterone i think it cant neutralize the changes that occured during puberty can they would love to know how this works thanks turns out i was unaware about a lot of scientific data on this topic i also hadnt searched the previous reddit threads on this topic too some of the arguments and research articles did help me change my mind on this subject what i am sure of as of now is that we need more research on this and letting them play is reasonable out right banning them from womens sports is not a solution maybe in some sports or in some cases there could be some restrictions placed but it would be more case to case basis than a general ban,1,236,1330,83,0.04819277108433735
cmv the current us bailouts for all the large companies is unfair to both the us taxpayers small businesses and every company that responsibly managed their money in recent years,recently the us government has given out trillions in bailouts to the airline retail hospitality etc industries however as a tax payer im outraged that these large corporations are getting these handouts from the government and getting rewarded for their greedy behavior the bank bailouts of 08 made me sick and i cant believe were doing this again millions of americans lost their jobs and their homes due to the banks irresponsible and illegal behavior and yet all these bankers made out with millions the airline industry for example 96 of their free cash flow was spent on stock buybacks this past decade these csuite executives and investors made millions off this type of behavior despite not creating any type of value for both the company and for their employees if your company cant last a few months of stagnant revenue you shouldnt be spending all that money on buybacks and dividends especially when a large reason these companies found so much excess money in the last couple years was an egregious gifted tax cut from the government sure no one could have foreseen the current environment but nearly every economist was predicting a recession within the next few years they should have prepared for some type of downturn  this punishes the companies that actually acted responsibly with their capital in normal circumstances this would be their opportunity to gain market share and even buy up some of the failing companies instead they are robbed of this opportunity the way our market works is that feedback is all seen through the lens of risk and reward when a company decides to spend almost all of their profits on buybacks they are taking the risk that a black swan event in the future can cause bankruptcy now we are removing the incentive for prudent decision making for companies whats to stop companies of only acting recklessly since they know the government will always bail them out lots of small businesses are going bankrupt everyday where are their bailouts why should large companies with every advantage in the world be given this lifeline for acting so irresponsibly when normal everyday people struggling to get by are not allotted this same opportunity anyone says it i understand bailouts are not free money theyre a loan by the government but the interest rates are typically much lower than they would command in the free market the government should either charge a high interest rate to compensate for that risk or inject money into these companies through equity investments that could be put in a blind trust at least in this scenario the bailout is seen through the lens of a prudent investment its also pricing in the risks of investing in these companies since we never know what will happen to them in the future if they dont want it they can find someone else to give them money or go bankrupt its not like these companies will just disappear there will be a buyer somewhere out there  one is entitled to a low interest loan from the government especially these mega corporations who barely pay above minimum wage for their lowest employees while constantly upping the csuites compensation by handing out bailouts that actually reflect the risk for these companies we can actually punish the csuite and investors who squeezed every bit of profit out of the company during good times since these deals will negatively affect the stock price the bailouts in its current form reward the ceos and investors who already cashed out in the past couple of years pushing for buybacks and increased dividends,1,606,3655,181,0.04419889502762431
cmv people who object to donating their organs after they died should be right at the bottom of the list when it comes to receiving an organ,"i frequently hear of people who dont want to donate their organs after they died because of religious reasons or because it feels creepy same goes for donating the organs of close relatives who left no clear orders for this case thought of having your organs removed may be scary and okaying the removal of a loved ones organs even more but if you cant come to terms with that you dont have the right to benefit from others making an grown up decision the same goes of course if your god forbids the removal of organs if your believe is more important to you than saving one or several persons lives then your god should better protect you from organ failure should of course be exempt insofar as they should receive organs independent from their parents choices course organs shouldnt be thrown out if theres no deserving recipient but they should only go to nondonors if there are no adequately compatible recipient available who would have donated themself

 it seems like recent election outcomes reflect these polls the last four out of five republican candidates lost the popular vote democrats have won the popular vote in 6 out of the 7 most recent general elections that means with the exception of bush in 2004 republicans havent won popular vote since 1988 32 years ago
 in addition it seems very likely that trump will lose the popular vote again in 2020 538 88 economist 97
 in 2018 midterm elections democrats won 18 million more votes in the senate election but republicans still gained 2 more seats and retained their majority now i understand the senate is designed to protect smaller states but winning despite having 18 million less popular votes feels like too much protection all this republicans have been able to cut taxes gut the affordable care act without providing any alternative and cut funding to the epa republicans have no interest in marijuana legalization there will most likely be a republican supermajority in the supreme court putting legal abortion in jeopardy fact that republicans currently hold power in the supreme court senate and presidency despite their lack of popular votes and the unpopularity of their policies shows that america is a tyranny of the minority thank you so much for the gold keep seeing the same arguments over and over again so i am going to start addressing some of them here is not a direct democracy so popular opinion doesnt matter this is how the government was originally designed i agree that america isnt and shouldnt be a direct democracy all i am arguing for is curbing back the power smaller states have
 for example the ratio of representation between california and wyoming in the senate is 11 despite the fact that the population ratio is 681 i dont think it is unreasonable to advocate for it being something closer to a 102 ratio this would still give wyoming disproportionate power in the senate
 we could also make electoral vote allocation more proportional instead of the fully winnertakeall system we have right now this could even benefit republicans because there are a lot of conservatives in blue states like california and new york that dont really have a voice in the general election
 while i believe we can use the original intent of the founders and their design of government as a guide i dont think we need to follow it religiously we have made changes to the government in the past and we can make changes to the government again
 if the disproportionate power of smaller states is severely undermining the will of the people i think it is reasonable to propose changes to certain institutions for something in polls isnt support for something to actually be enacted i think the way the majority of americans are voting shows that the support for these policies extends beyond polling definition tyranny requires cruelty so america is not a tyranny i will work from this definition from oxford cruel unreasonable or arbitrary use of power or control
 i believe the disproportionate power of smaller states is unreasonable and arbitrary in its current state polls are flawed i am not a stats or polling expert so i dont know how to resolve this in a convincing manner it is very possible that the polling is flawed because of their population size demographics the way their questions are asked etc
 that being said most of the polls i cited are from gallup and pew research which are widely regarded as reliable",1,670,4990,42,0.09523809523809523

cmv it is not unfair to expect your so to at least attempt to maintain some form of physical attractiveness throughout the relationship,i struggled with the title a bit so read on if it is unclear  view of mine stems from a debate i got into with a friend of mine lets call her sam we were discussing a mutual friend of ours who well call john who after years of being with his so broke up with her because she got fat sams words  at first glance yes that may be the heart of what happened but of course deep down a lot of other factors were at play johns so getting fat was a gradual process which reflected her level of comfort in a relationship she thought was stable and set for life she had done all the hard work  winning over john  and now that they have moved in together and had discussions about marriage and possibly kids she subconsciously or not thought she could finally let it go and not have to try so hard as blissful as that may be and for some perhaps the goal of a longterm relationship i think this mentality is fundamentally flawed and horribly unfair on john yes people change as they grow and yes when you marry or form a longterm relationship with someone you accept that but personality change over a lifetime is for the most part beyond ones control deciding to stop exercising drinking a bottle of wine every night after work and overindulging on biscuits while watching too much tv on the sofa as part of a daily ritual is not its a sign of resignation  is now in a difficult position he fell in love with the beautiful girl he met at that party she had a wonderful figure and clearly took care of her body her sexiness lit a fire under him and their chemistry was both physical and mental as they started dating he respected the effort she went to stay in good shape and she clearly didnt do it just to get the guy it was for herself too she was proud and confident of how she looked yet over the last couple of years all of this side of her had slowly disintegrated she just didnt care anymore her lack of caring for herself was in itself unattractive and john suddenly started having problems in the bedroom too as a result yet was he just being shallow should he just suck it up and accept this change as normal and continue in this relationship which he entered under conditions which have now changed without his consent if he finds her unattractive now after only a few years what will happen to their relationship in 10 years the end john did have many discussions with his so about this she accepted she had let things go a bit and said she would try harder but after another 6 months of no change he decided the best thing was to end it since he didnt feel the same way and the two parted ways  back to my debate with sam she was quite offended by johns behaviour to her he was obviously a very shallow man and his treatment of his exso was unfair i on the other hand was completely on johns side when you enter a longterm relationship with someone especially a marriage you make an agreement to try your best to love and be loved by that person for as long as you can you enter the agreement based on terms at that point in time i love you my so because of who you are and who i predict you will become yet when your so essentially breaks this contract and gives up being the person that you fell in love with your feelings for them are bound to change this goes for not only personality characteristics and psychological wellbeing but also physical appearance since no matter how all the romanticists like to spin it it is a culmination of all of these components which make up you as a person  they way he dealt with it was also very fair and full of communication he didnt just dump her suddenly he expressed his feelings to her gave her a chance to think it over and adapt it should she chose to she didnt and so for both of their best interests in the long run they split up  fundamental view is then that it is not unfair to expect your so to keep working for lack of a better word for your love and vice versa whether that be maintaining their physical appearance as best as time will let you of course or maintaining common interests so you dont hate each other in 20 years time for example it therefore is unfair for your so to give up and take marriagelongterm relationships as an excuse to stop trying love to hear some opinions this has blown up way more than i anticipated and i’m afraid i’d struggle to reply to everyone at this stage i really do appreciate all the responses on both sides of the argument and am fascinated by what everyone has to say as of yet my mind hasn’t been changed but i’ve certainly heard some great arguments i’ll keep checking in and will respond where i can i’m going to summarise a really common argument i keep seeing ”as we get old we all grow and change our bodies age beauty is temporary no one can stay physically attractive forever etc” to respond to this i wholeheartedly agree and accept that fact but i accept it as a slow process that takes decades and in most scenarios happens simultaneously to both partners as they age in john and his so’s example i presented above it happened suddenly within the first few years of their relationship and it was purely a onesided change again it keeps coming back to differing expectations and values john’s expectations of a healthy longterm relationship clearly didn’t include giving up all the advantages of an active and healthy lifestyle while he and his partner were still in their twenties whereas his so’s expectations were quite the contrary at this stage after only two years of living together they were already suffering attraction issues and the foundations of resentment were forming in their relationship surely that is evidence enough that their expectations in their relationship did not match and it would therefore be best for both of them to end it before it got more serious marriage and kids,1,1094,6042,139,0.04316546762589928

cmv we shouldnt judge people from history by modern day values,"today a statue of edward colston was torn down by protestors because of his involvement in the slave trade see   reason he had a statue is due to his philanthropy and historical importance to bristol wording from the plaque on his statueedward colston 1636–1721 mp for bristol 1710–1713 was one of this  citys greatest benefactors he supported and endowed schools  almshouses hospitals and churches in bristol london and elsewhere info   understand why people are angry and i dont think we should be celebrating bad aspects of the past slavery is wrong however we shouldnt hide from the past either and i dont think people are wholly good or bad i think the best way to judge someone is by the context they lived in argument about right or wrong would be complete without mentioning adolf hitler he was an evil person by modern standards and also by standards of his time hence the world war to stop him so monuments to hitler arent appropriate even if he also did some good things  on the other hand was a slave trader at a time before the abolition movement really started in england donating money to education places of worship and the care of the sickold is probably considered good in any time period or culture so in his day he would have been seen in a positive light should judge people by standards of the time they live in not by the standard of today celebrating the good aspects of a historical figure who did wrong by modern day standards is unfair and risks suppressing history change my view wanted to keep this fairly general but ill say something specifically on the european slave trade with america i think people dislike it so intensely because its still having a lasting effect to this day i doubt a statue of a roman would get this level of anger even though they had a huge slave trade same goes for the great pyramids in egypt mind was changed thanks everyone there have been some really interesting discussions on this thread thanks for the gold we still need to be careful judging historic figures by modern standards i think that it can be justified here are my new key points when considering something like a public statue was what they did ok at the time
 how bad is it by modern interpretation
 can the good celebrated by the statue be disconnected from the bad in the case of colston its a no
 time matters slavery in colstons time still has a lasting impact slavery in caesars time not so much
 there is a difference between good and great when examining someone doing something good ie philanthropy the bad counterbalances this when someone is considered great it is for something big and possibly unique that changed the course of history
 statues and monuments no longer deserving of public praise should be moved to a museum where proper context can be given",1,503,3323,65,0.06153846153846154

 while certain parts of the jedi code specifically lines 2 and 5 are good the rest of it seems to be pushing a worldview based on restraint discipline and order now this in and of itself is fine but it accomplishes this by restricting the influence of passion passion  emotion is the chief governing factor in humans maybe its different for certain alien species i dont know
 sith on the other hand encourage passion they use it control it and gain strength and inspiration from it this is their strength but also their weakness emotion can grant power but it can also blind you
 neither the cold orderly philosophy of the jedi nor the reckless abandon of restraint of the sith are necessarily worth following passion should never be without restraint but the abandonment of it by the jedi is both unrealistic and harmful to its members so while i wouldnt endorse the entirety of sith philosophy i would certainly endorse leaning into the dark side more than the light

cmv changing the race or sex of a comic book character for the sake of diversity is stupid,i often see this notion online where when an actors time is up in a show movie or series of movies that the character in questions race or gender should be changed for example upon watching the recently released batman trailer with robert pattinson playing batman i saw a large group of people in the comments and on twitter suggesting that if the joker is to be added he should be played by lakeith stanfield a black actor upon reading these peoples ideas i thought to myself what the point of changing a characters race is simply for the sake of diversity when it doesnt align with the portrayal of the character at hand dont get me wrong im all for having characters on tv or in cinema be any race or gender so long as the actor playing said character fits the history of the character eg black panther captain marvel lucius fox etc another example of this issue is the conversation of having an actor such as idris elba play james bond when the character has always been white throughout the 007 movies regardless of the race or sex of a character i feel its appropriate to match the actor with said race or sex it’s been a while since i created this post and it kinda blew up so don’t think i’m intentionally avoiding a specific topic or thought process it’s just hard to keep track of replying to this many comments gonna take a bit of a break from responding it’s getting kinda hard to keep track of so many comments and responses but i thank you for giving them nonetheless also to the few outliers ruining it by calling me a racist and a sexist fuck off,1,292,1620,91,0.04395604395604396
cmv the proposed wealth tax by bernie and warren will positively impact our economy and billionaires won’t be able to avoid the tax,"i’m looking for reasons to cmv because i’m definitely no tax or economics expert i am curious about potential effects a 6 tax rate on billionaires would have and if it would actually be enforced correctly thing i’m reading about is since they can hire the best tax consultants there will be many loopholes that will keep their net worth from being taxed for example how will property’s or other assets be assessed fairly there are not many comparables to use on mega mansions so in court they could argue a much lower value i figure that even a lowball assessed value in a billionaires net worthestate will still be “good enough” though since someone with 10 billion in assets probably can’t argue all the way down to an assessed value 1 billion and they’ll still be subject to the wealth tax  goes into another area i’m not familiar with would they be able to move assets to another country without these taxes does bernie or warren have a foolproof way of stopping this these billionaires financial advisors certainly would do the math now if they feel such a policy will come into effect and if they figure a 6 tax on their wealth would ruin them in a few years they could move their net worth to another country beforehand since im assume moving the wealth would also be taxed after whatever bill passes to stop exactly this again skeptical of loopholes and would like some insight on what they would do in reality if they could do this could this end up weakening our economy 
i really would like some opinions on those who think these taxes won’t work well or if work as desired may end up impacting our economy since reddit echo chambers typically don’t delve into any of the finer details that i feel i need to have an educated opinion",1,317,1785,134,0.05223880597014925
cmv the controversy surrounding liam neesons recent interview is wholly irrational and shows plainly the counterprodictivity of outrage culture,for those unfamiliar with the controversy ill give a brief overview liam neeson recently was giving an interview about his new movie cold pursuit which is being branded as a very dark comedy with the futilityuselessness of revenge being the main theme neeson talks about how the character is ultimately lead into a life of criminality and violence by his thirst for revenge very explicitly framing this as a negative thing in being asked by the interviewer how he channels that emotion to play the character he tells a story he says 40 years ago a close friend of his was brutally raped and in asking about who the rapist was discovered they were black he then says he went around for a week in black neighborhoods hoping some black bastard would start a fight with him so he could kill them any random black person he then says that when he finally came down from that emotional reaction of wanting revenge he was shocked and disgusted with the way it had made him behave he says he had been so ashamed of it that he had never told almost anyone about it up until that point but that he learned from the experience this prompted outrage on the internet with many calling for him to be banned form the oscars to be blacklisted by hollywood and even to have his oscar taken away is insane to me whats the goal of calling out racism and identifying it so that we all as a society may learn from it grow and hope to do better moving forward but also in the hopes that the person being racist will see the error of their ways and change this case you have a man most famous for playing a historical figure who helped jews during the holocaust who is not expressing racist thoughts and not engaging in racist behavior but rather is recounting thoughts and behavior from four decades ago and self describing it as shocking disgusting and having made him feel ashamed of himself this is a man who grew up in northern ireland while it was at war where bigotry was commonplace and revenge killings and bombings against catholics and protestants happened on a daily basis growing up in an environment like that bigotry is taught as second nature so enraged by his sense of revenge he went out with violent intentions aimed at an innocent group of people because he was taught to think that way this same man then realized what he was doing was wrong learned from it grew from it and seemingly has spent the rest of his life ashamed that his emotions and upbringing had caused him to think and behaves that way  is it that people hope to accomplish by punishing him he explicitly recognized that this was horrible and only brought it up in the context that seeking revenge makes people do horrible things he has already learned hes already grown this isnt even a gotcha moment that someone dug up from his past he volunteered it as an example of not the right way to think or behave how are we going to say hes racist some people point to his use of the phrase black bastard but if you listen in the clip hes describing his thought process at that time hes clearly speaking as his younger self and to ascribe that to how he feels today is intellectually disingenuous believe that by seeking to punish a man using his own experiences to teach and display the way that bigotry and anger can make you do awful things outrage culture is actively getting in the way of having the difficult conversations that need to be had about race the reddit app is giving me trouble not loading any comments beyond what ive  already responded  to and i wont be able to respond on a computer for a while just wanted to let people know im not dodging questions or responses im just literally unable to even see them 2 wow this really blew up while i was asleep ill be making an effort to get around to as many responses as i can this morning and afternoon since ill have access to my desktop do want to add in this edit both to make it relevant as per the rules but also because ive been seeing a lot of this argument that some of you need to justify the concept that humans either cant change or that there is a logical reason to not treat them differently for having changed many of you are arguing that essentially nobody should be forgiven for having held racist views or done racist things no matter how much theyve changed and no matter how badly they feel about it those people i want to ask several questions do you think that people can change if not why not given that we have mountains of psychological and historical evidence indicating otherwise do you think people who have changed should be treated as though they hadnt if so why given that in changing they definitionally are a different person than they were most importantly why what is the advantage of thinking this way how does never forgiving people help your cause of the opinion that if one truly hates racism and bigotry one has to conduct themselves in a way that facilitates change so that these ideals can be more quickly removed from society the only way that happens is by creating fewer racists one mode of doing this is by educating the young but another is by changing the minds of those who have been taught incorrectly so that they are both one fewer racist and also one more educator of their children to think the right way in order to change my view you must logically show how it follows that punishing people for being honest about the changes theyve made and for making those changes at all encourages social progress thing id like many of you to do is provide any evidence that youd have done better growing up in as hateful an environment as northern ireland during the troubles many of you as arguing that because not all people at any given point in time were racist that to have been conditioned to behave and think a certain way is inexcusable this to me is logically identical to the arguments made by actual modern racists in the us to justify calling black men rapists and murderers it ignores everything we understand about psychology and the role nurture plays in developing personality to clarify since many if you seem patently wrong about this sorry if thats rude but its true i am not and neeson himself is not justifying his past actions he views them as disgusting shocking and shameful i also view them that way in explaining the thought process that lead him to take these actions he is not justifying them he is explaining them there is both a definitional and from the perspective of the listener i believe also a moral difference between explaining how an intense emotion can lead someone from the wrong type of upbringing to do an awful thing and saying that the awful thing isnt awful because of the context at no point have i or neeson argued that what he did wasnt awful or that it was justified 3 id like to moderators allowing make one final edit to a point that i am seeing very commonly and would more easily be addressed here though it may not seem an important distinction when you are trying to view a man as unforgivable neeson didnt hurt anyone not because he didnt encounter any black people but because none started fights with him he wasnt roaming the streets looking for any black person minding their own business to beat up and kill he was hoping to be attacked so that he could feel justified in defending himself this is an important distinction for multiple reasons one it shows though still heinous that even at his worst he was not trying to be a murderer he was trying to be a racist vigilante two it shows very clearly the social bias at the time which is still present today that he figured black people were thugs and criminals so he figured if he just walked around one would give him cause to enact his again unjustified and racist revenge three and most importantly it is exactly because he took this approach instead of killing some random black person that not only was nobody hurt but that it showed him exactly how wrong he was it proved plainly that this group of people were not all like his friends rapist that black people arent just thugs and criminals and that it was disgusting shocking and shameful in his own words to behave the way he did this is implicit in him describing that he learned from the experience because he realized exactly what he was and what he was doing in looking to be attacked and not being attacked he realized how repulsive his actions and thoughts were once the emotion of the moment had faded to fail to make the distinction between he didnt kill a black person because he never saw a black person and he didnt kill a black person because none attacked him is to entirely miss the point of the story that he was trying to make as well as to factually misrepresent it and to ignore how this event influenced his views to change in the future,1,1616,9069,148,0.04054054054054054
cmv all these surfacelevel reforms like making sure black characters are not voiced by non black voice actors are a near worthless distraction,i cant say it any better than the title whether its deliberate or not all this performative action like changing the name of streets removing ben from uncle bens rice and actors stepping down feels like a distraction and a waste of time when theres still little accountability for police action very little societal change will come from the simpsons changing up their cast but ive seen more media coverage of these changes than i have of currently ongoing protests i understand the stated benefit for some of these actions but it feels so cheap and worthless,1,97,571,145,0.027586206896551724
cmv i believe that basic financial skills such as book keeping and introductory accounting should be taught in high school,my belief is that basic financial skills should be a requirement in high school  as i went through high school then college i realized that many people including me did not have a proper understanding of how to balance our personal budgets  going through my accounting major i believe that many of the basic skills that i learned in my first intro accounting class would benefit many young adults who are just entering the real world and that these classes would be just as beneficial if not more so than classes such as history or social studies  my reasoning for this is that everyone who lives in society has to balance a budget from the lowest level workers all the way up to the csuite executives  these skills could also help students to look at their post school prospective student with a keener eye such as balancing their chosen major and the school they want to go to relative to the cost and future benefit those majors would bring in their careers  and if they don’t choose to go to higher education they can still benefit from the basic book keeping and budgeting skills in their personal lives  i would like to know if anyone doesn’t feel like such classes would be beneficial in high school or earlier and am open to changing my view,1,231,1266,124,0.03225806451612903
cmv modern education must focus on interpreting and applying information rather than simply memorising it,most information taught in school is completely redundant and of little practical use today in the age of intrrnet we have access to any piece of information we want so there is no point in memorising it if randomly i needed to know the boiling point of ammonia i wouldnt rely on my memory from 8th grade within a few clicks i would have it in front of me are already free and certified courses for all types of studies rather schools should teach how to better understand what is available online and make sure only accurate and proper information is taken this will also help students explore on their own and come up with different ideas not cramming the same paras should be encouraged to access information on their own and how to do it this will also make them better understand internet as a whole and all its antiques along with what you can trust and not i dont mean to completely scrape away memorisation at an elementary level itis important but certainly not for like 85 of your education,1,182,1042,107,0.037383177570093455
cmv there should be a maximum age to run for president,so in the usa we have a minimum age of 35 to run for president although i object to that number i do see the reasoning behind it ie being too uninformed to be effective i think equally if not even moreso this should apply to a maximum age as well joe biden as an example the man is 34 years past the median age of the state with the highest median age maine 43 this is close to double the median at best  is effectively no way the man or any older candidate could possibly be in touch with the issues facing most of the country this is only going to become a larger and larger divide as time goes on and quicker advances in technology create larger gaps of understanding between age groups this there are more practical reasons such as straight up dying in office from old age again using biden as an example hes less than 15years away from hitting the life expectancy of a male in the usa obviously a man in such a position would have a higher life expectency than the average but come on its the white house not a nursing home almost no person in his 60s70s will perform mentally or physically as well as on their 40s50s and the country shouldnt have to undergo a transition of power because some geriatric decided to run for office in his twilight years is no practical advantage i can see for having a candidate over say 60 run having experience in politics is great and all but not when the bulk of your experience is in a world that no longer exists in the same way,1,284,1533,55,0.05454545454545454

cmv to be antitobacco andor antidrug and not antialcohol is hypocritical,"the crux of the antitobacco and antidrug movements is that they’re addictive and harmful to those who use them and society at large yet despite there being more alcoholics than drug addicts 2 million vs 14 million and despite more people at least in the us dying from alcohol related causes 67000 vs 88000 people seem far less 
concerned and yes people might say that “alcohol kills and addicts a smaller portion of its users” but that still doesn’t change the fact that far more people are being seriously harmed or even killed by alcohol real numbers are far more important to me personally if public health is the goal the solution should be obvious alcohol needs to be discouraged with the same vigor and much of the same tactics as tobacco i want to clarify this since some people seem a little confused i said in the post that alcohol should be discouraged and with the same tactics as tobacco i’m not a prohibitionist nor do i feel i implied so some people have mentioned that prohibition doesn’t work i agree that’s not my view",1,186,1074,77,0.05194805194805195
cmv the idea of “white fragility” is racist isn’t helpful and just exists to antagonize whites,"i’ve seen this idea of white fragility all over reddit for the past year and i frankly find it deplorable  crux of most of the postsdiscussions concerning white fragility follow the basic format of someone says something racially questionable toward white people white person says “hey don’t say that” or “i don’t appreciate that” then someone calls the white person racistfragile for not tolerating racism toward them then the white person defends themselves as not a racist and is subsequently confirmed as a racist person is then called fragile for not tolerating racism toward them and then is deemed racist through the infallible logic of “the only people who have say that their not racist are racists”  isn’t a helpful way of thinking because no one should be called fragile or mocked for calling out racist behavior or for defending themselves against slanderlibel
 idk if i can put this here but i think it’s a δ i have no issue with people being called fragile but there’s no need to create a broad idea of white fragility if someone is being a dick call them out but dont bring their race into it again don’t know if this counts as a δ but i have now read the definition from the book “white fragility” that doesn’t change my general opinion but the original definition of there term exist to antagonize",1,232,1364,98,0.04081632653061224

cmv smokers who smoke in public are selfish and ultimately dont consider other peoples health problems,"edit wow never imagined such a crazy response to this nor have i ever posted anything thats gone a bit viral i could never have the time to ultimately respond to 500 messages but i do think that my argument was flawed in that i wasnt aware that smokers had limited spaces to smokei didnt consider their side of the coin i also agree with a lot of peoples responses that ive seen regarding perfumes body odour loud noise etc although i would argue that the effects of those things are just a minor annoyance whereas my physical reaction to cigarette smoke is more severe however i am clearly a minority in that regard thank you so much for taking the time to educate me a bit more and im sorry i cant dig through that many responses were all just out there doing our best and i wasnt being very respectful of that   
 three years now ive been living in a city that has a high  of cigarette smokers while a lot of them respectfully smoke in designated areas theres still a large number that smoke while walking down sidewalks beside door entrances and other places in which nonsmokers cant avoid it makes me wonder are they aware of the fact that their smoke travels and unwillingly enters the lungs of strangers walking by do they understand how incredibly uncomfortable it is for a nonsmoker with asthma to breathe in this toxic air with no choice their decision to inhale poison somehow becomes my problem even driving in a car that smells like smoke seems to upset my insides trying to come at it from a more compassionate angle but the truth is we all share air and as someone who struggles with vocal cord issues and other lung related complications the secondhand public smoke highly disturbs me and leads me to believe that you are not very considerate or aware of your surroundings smoke travels and its killing our lungs and our planet id like to better understand where smokers are coming from if they are in fact aware of all of this and how i can maybe help friends who want to quit etc

cmv sex ed should be mandatory,"good comprehensive sex ed should be mandatory schools in the middle of america don’t do sex ed or if they do they make it super watered down ignorant hyperreligious parents protest sex ed because they don’t like the idea of the children growing up or using birth control fact of the matter is your kid is eventually going to find porn no matter how hard you try seeing porn without knowing anything about sex is an absolute train wreck for your relationships girls will see themselves as objects boys will start to view girls as objects both will get unhealthy kinks and fetishes relationships will depend on sex children will be losing their virginity wayyyy too early and they won’t have condoms because their sex ed class isn’t providing them and they’re too scared of their toxic religious parents to buyget them boycotting sex ed you’re risking that your child will have an unhealthy sex life i haven’t seen someone provide an argument that isn’t “jesus jesus jesus bible bible bible premarital premarital premarital”
 abstinenceonly sex ed isn’t something i support i’ve experienced sex ed that included a teacher who only showed us anatomy and how puberty works they didn’t mention sex at all they just hinted at it saying “don’t do anything bad” if you’ve seen the episode of family guy in which a religious leader does the sex ed for meg’s school though it is exaggerated i’ve heard that a few sex ed classes do run similar to that and i know that many parents want sex ed to run like that

1 not all parents teach their kids about the birds and the bees of course abstinence is 100 guaranteed to keep you from stis and it should be taught but birth control should also be taught
 i know a lot of parents i know a lot of kids at the age in which they should know about birth control and sti’s i don’t like the government and of course i would want the guideline for the lessons to be approved by the public but i think the government would do better creating a sex ed program than some parents course no one is going to agree on one program i think that nearly all parents who disagree with what it’s teaching will tell their children what they are learning is wrong and at the age where they would be learning sex ed they would’ve developed a relationship with their parents if something that’s taught in sex ed isn’t right and parents point it out to their children children with good relationships with their parents will listen to them children with toxic parents likely will trust educators over their parents i sure would’ve trusted my sex ed teacher over my parents",1,463,2673,32,0.125

there is nothing wrong with assuming someone’s gender the vast majority of people especially in western culture are not in the lgbtq spectrum and even within those that are people that are gender nonconforming are a small minority these people makeup such a small percentage of the population that they are rare given this assuming someone that presents as malefemale  is assuming something that is going to be the case in 90 of instances so assuming that someone falls into the largest category is not wrong but is safe for most of modern history correct me if i am wrong on that and majorly observable instances of society we have only known two genders though evidence suggest some societies recognize a third ie thailand ladyboys and in south america some cultures historically recognized transgender people it is therefore most likely that we only understand two and expect two and most likely that they are what they were assigned as birth so it seems that if someone presents male or female it is fair to assume that they are male or female given that these are likely to be the vast majority of experiences i am assuming here someone that is mtf being called male rather than someone that looks like a mtf but wants to be called male it seems fair that someone would assume gender based on what is observable that get upset are being over sensitive  i know that it is not many that truly get upset about this on reddit it looks like a huge swath of the population thanks to things like rtumblrinaction but i know they are the minority thanks to this and other times it seems that these people are wanting to yell at anyone and are playing victim when they aren’t understanding the other will gladly explain more as needed and look forward to replies",1,324,1874,124,0.03225806451612903
cmv instead of teaching youth to not judge we should be teaching them how to judge with kindness mercy logic and fairness,"let me start by explaining what i mean when i say judge in this context  am a father of a 5 year old girl and as anyone whos spent a lot of time with babies and young children i want to help guide her through life and give her the tools to interpret the world around her  we see a child behaving very poorly in public there are times when i choose to speak with her about whats happening at the onset of this moment when we are going to voice our thoughts about the behavior of others whether its my daughter and i you by yourself in your head or anyone in really any circumstance we are entering a judgmental space by its literal definition  way to frame or speak about some elses actions requires judgments to be made our society has made the word judgmental have strong negative connotations and i believe people are uncomfortable with using others as teaching opportunities for fear of being judgmental  an example of what im talking about daughter and i see a child screaming in the market jumping up and down creating a massive scene hitting their parent ect ill ask my daughter why do you think theyre being so terrible i insert the view im teaching that the behavior is terrible so judgment is made but begin a dialogue normally shell say theyre mad or something like that and well talk about things that make us mad what might have this other child mad  ill say something like i get mad you get mad everyone gets mad sometimes its ok to be mad but thats not how we act when were mad right yup  why do you think we dont want to act like that and discuss how its disruptive and rude to other people in the store ect believe we should be creating a template for judgment to exist where its where the persons identity isnt attacked but their behavior and actions content of their character are understood and discussed  we incorporate lessons of what and what not do from others as well as we do from ourselves and judge things in a manner thats kind to the individual not attacking their identity thats with mercy understanding we all experience these things with logic and fairness  by being honest about how those behaviors impact others around

the person who could change my view would do so by showing me how this style of parenting causes more harm than good and i shouldnt have a conversation with my daughter making judgments about the misbehaving child 
 after reading lots of really amazing responses i have learned a few things firstly that framing things this way with some of the specific language could be bad for my daughter because when she steps out of line she inserts herself as the terrible child or that she is doing terrible things which may be true by whatever definition we have for terrible it can damage self esteem and doesnt promote healthy learning  there is a problem with syntax and semantics with the term judgment and while none of those arguments swayed me they are still very much relevant  its friday afternoon and im going home be well  this is a footnote from the cmv moderators wed like to remind you of a couple of things firstly please read through our rules if you see a comment that has broken one it is more effective to report it than downvote it speaking of which downvotes dont change views any questions or concerns feel free to message us happy cmving",1,614,3728,130,0.03076923076923077
cmv the push for political correctness is what indirectly caused the rise of people like trump and his ilk around the world,its  a pattern that you can see throughout history all the time the society  is always somewhat split on certain topics but its only when one side  tries to push a little too hard that the other one is provoked into a  strong counterreaction you can see that in every other discussion   the more selfrighteous you are the less likely youre to convince the  other person to agree with you or to at least not violently disagree  with you that applies double for the internet  political establishments of pretrump era thought that they could  simply enshrine their progressive views in law and all would be well  you cant say this or that anymore it could insult someone you would  often hear how can you say that  in 21st century would be a common line too youd have people  lecturing others on how the world should change what everyone should  and shouldnt do and meanwhile some people got the impression that rug  was being pulled from under their feet the world as they knew it  started disappearing before  someone brings it up im pretty much what the americans would call a  liberal but i dont believe in revolutions and sudden changes   thats political romanticism the more sudden a change the smaller a  chance that its going to stick the true change is a slow progress and  is made through meaningful dialogue you may feel righteous when you  insult conservative christians as backwards and deluded because there  is science to support your views you can get outraged over another  persons view on sexuality and call them whatnot if you disagree with  them you can call progun people nutjobs and beat them over the head  with statistics but keep in mind that if you try to convince someone  too hard they are more likely to go in the opposite direction  the next time you feel like youre completely in the right wherever on  the political spectrum you are lets remember that the other side  thinks so too its okay to disagree we are human beings and we are  not completely rational if we want the other person to at least listen we need to be kind first my view has been partially changed ive come to agree that political correctness was not the sole reason for trump getting elected but i am still unconvinced that mockery lecturing humiliation and insults are a way to go in political discussion and that i still insist that the only thing this accomplishes is driving the other side further away post has kinda exploded so its not within my power to answer everyones replies so i apologize about that there have been some great points in the discussion so thank you very much for taking part,1,492,2709,125,0.04
cmv just like sex education religion should be introduced to children only after they have reached a certain age and level of maturity,"let me be clear i know this cannot be imposed in any form by a government or a law i am proposing this simply as a guideline for current and future parents  arguments are as follows children in their early formative years are incapable of rational informed thought their entire universe is structured around what their parents tell them if you tell them that the earth is the shape of an upside down icecream cone and the sun is at the tip of it they will believe you not just believe you this will become their truth 
 as an adult your religious beliefs directly influence the life you lead  it will influence the decisions you make in terms of your life partner you choose the company you keep the vote you cast and the path you take in life it should not affect these things in an ideal world but we do not live in such an ideal world 
 considering the vast impact that your religious beliefs have it seems very unfair to have one particular strict unflinching dogma drilled into you during your formative years as a kid religion should be a choice just like your hobbies your friends and your career you may argue that many of us were raised this way and we eventually grew out of it or changed our views once we reached maturity and broadened our horizons but that is not a valid argument in my book for every story of a person who has changed or given up religion there is another story of someone whos upbringing was extremely strict or orthodox and it continues to define them as an adult with our without their knowing consent  this particular point may be directed to a very small subsection of the parent population but im going to make it anyways some parents use religion as a crutch to assist them in raising their children by this i mean that god is the perfect scary allpowerful metaphorical carrot  stick for your kids teach your kids not to steal because it is the wrong thing to do not because god is watching teach your kids to help the poor because it is the right thing to do not because it will help them get into heaven i dont want to tell parents how to raise their kids but i am drawing from my own personal upbringing gist of my argument is this religion is a beautiful thing if understood and practiced as it is meant to be if not it can turn ugly and cause misery to oneself and others therefore it should be introduced to children carefully and only once they are mature enough to grasp its meaning and purpose",1,461,2525,137,0.029197080291970802
cmv police officers should face harsher punishment for committing crimes than the general public,we see it all the time cops abusing their power committing all sorts of crimes dui assault sex crimes extortion etc  and the judicial system consistently lets them off the hook i dont want to pretend that we dont see people fighting against this behaviour because we obviously do but at the same time it is still wildly obvious that this stuff happens far too often and continually puts the safety of the public at risk  huge problem that comes directly from this issue is that officers who do attempt to stop this type of behaviour whether it be willing to arrest other officers or just refusing to participate face massive backlash in the workplace from the rest of the force theyre actively incentivized to not stop this behaviour  believe that if cops knew that the punishments they would receive for committing these crimes were harsher than those given out to the public they would be less willing to commit these crimes and fellow officers would be more willing to fight back against it as they may see that ignoring it is the same as participating and their livelihood is on the line too the same time i understand there may be other ways to achieve this i just have no idea what it could be so until then this is my belief change my view,1,229,1289,98,0.04081632653061224
cmv the freedom of speech must remain nearly absolute  not because hate speech is okay but because the government would abuse a restriction on freedom of speech,"when we talk about restricting the freedom of speech what were typically talking about is the elimination of hate speech from the definition of what counts as free speech this comes from an admirable place  hate speech is absolutely a social evil  but removing hate speech in general from the definition of free speech on a legal level is a horrific idea because the government would improperly dictate and thus abuse what hate speech was ill provide three examples to demonstrate what i mean  
  
1 the nword undoubtedly the nword is hate speech in certain contexts however the caveat is that it simply isnt in other situations when a character on boondocks says it or an actor in american history x says it etc the context is appropriate however this level of nuance is unlikely to be handled properly by the government and either black people would lose the freedom to say it along with racists or else racists would retain their ability to use it as hate speech making the law more or less ineffective if you dont like the example refer to the other ones  im not here to debate when its okay for which people to say the word  
  
2 the police and other notatrisk groups in several countries the acronym acab all cops are bastards is considered hate speech being a policeman is however a vocation and not an atrisk group in any sense for the same reason that cracker and honkey arent really hate speech acab is also not hate speech  white people arent at risk of racial discrimination and the police suffer no discrimination whatsoever this is all to say even if you dislike the examples that the government will get to nitpick what counts as hate speech and will inevitably include some stupid shit im not here to debate if its okay to say acab honkey or cracker either pick a different example of fake hate speech if you prefer
  
3 the alien and sedition acts when the government is given an inch it takes a mile the alien and sedition acts both times are the perfect example of what the government would almost certainly do if hate speech broadly defined were made illegal like acab other antigovernment antipolice and antipolitician speech would become socalled hate speech and thus be made illegal through semantic games and if you think weve learned since then just remember that the same logic lead to the 2007 american banking crisis since it was used to repeal glasssteagal things dont change as much as people think they do  
  
all in all the people in power dictate what speech would could as hate speech and this fact would not create a situation with less hate speech but with either no change or primarily in absurd restrictions on nonhate speech",1,484,2783,163,0.024539877300613498
cmv reddit has become extremely infected by us politics and propaganda,"most subs have turned into a “trump bad bernie good” circlejerk even when completely unrelated to us politics prime example is rworldnews  everything on the front page is antitrump or usrelated when it is for world news don’t get me started on the net neutrality hysteria of 2017 i’ve actually almost got ptsd from that website is way too uscentric and most of americans think they are the only country that uses reddit so much gatekeeping
 feel reddit would be in a much better place if people would just calm down with the politics there are subs for that not to mention people should be more inclusive of other countries and not talk like america is the only country that uses reddit i didn’t expect this to blow up i myself am a bernie fan and hate trump however i live in australia and kinda want a breath of fresh air when i go on reddit and not be brainwashed by all the us stuff on here example i only just found out what an arby’s is this year and i’m 25yo xd the people here assume everyone on reddit knows about american things that are otherwise nonexiststant in other countries yeah that’s what i mean",1,207,1174,71,0.09859154929577464
cmv it should be legal for homeless people to sleep in their cars or in public places as long as they arent bothering anyone,its illegal in most places in my state at least for people to sleep in their cars or in public parks etc a homeless person i know very well told me many stories about basically being shuffled around by cops for parking his car in a neighborhood and sleeping in it no interaction with any of the people there or anything just sleeping in the car some homeless people are disruptive or doing illegal shit which of course should get them moved but really whats the plan if they have no money just tell them to buy a house i think being unsightly isnt enough of a reason to kick someone out of a public place and a minimum of human dignity should at least allow them to sleep in someplace safer than the woods being poor shouldnt be illegal and sure maybe getting thrown in jail gives vagrants a place to sleep but that should be their decision and not the states a couple of people have mentioned congregations or minicities arising which i think is a fair point especially due to health concerns at least for restricting sleeping in certain heavily populated areas not sure who to give a delta to new to the sub do i just give them to everybody who made the point 2 also im getting a vibe that incorrect sedantry is the perceived problem not people who live nomadic lifestyles id like to clarify that im including nomadic people really just anyone who gets fined for sleeping especially those who park their car at 10pm in some quiet neighborhood and intend to leave at 6am im also wondering more about the moral aspects of the problem   3 do somewhat agree with the comments about sleeping in a park implies they wont have a place to throw trash shit etc and causes an implied health hazard im not entirely convinced the implied hazard is a justification for sleeping to be illegal but im willing to listen id also like to point out im talking about sleeping not setting up businessestents and blocking the sidewalk during the day also im on board with the congregationalism problem as those are specific circumstances the local government needs to specifically address   for the people telling me to invite a ton of homeless people to sleep on my driveway rude there have probably been homeless people who have parked legally on your street and slept overnight that you didnt even notice if homeless people turned your street parking into a car apartment that would be a problem but there are already laws in most places to prevent permanent parking i dont want homeless people to live in your house or for your neighborhood park to become a tent city     live in a somewhat poor neighborhood and the people living in homes around cause much more trouble than the occasional homeless i see sleep on the street i get that you dont like homeless people existing a large portion of the chronic homeless population do have drughygiene problems i dont want those people near me either but thats a different problem i just think it shouldnt be illegal to park your car somewhere and sleep overnight or sleep under a bench if youre too poor to afford a car please keep responses limited to the legality of sleeping in public spaces without inebriation or public disturbance,1,574,3280,127,0.031496062992125984

cmv all religions are just oldbig cults,"i thought about it recently both sides are literally brainwashed by their leaders and sacred text
i was born in a religious house and ever since i remember myself there was always a push to be religious and not ask questions some are welcome but the questions i asked was always left unanswered ignored or just completely telling me that i cant ask it 
when i understood that i stopped asking questions and figured out i dont have to be my parents dream cause im my own person
lately ive seen some videos about cults and i cant see a big difference between religion and cult both are following blindly whatever the higher being they believe in and will diekill for it trying to be offensive or anything but it does really feel like it

 thanks for all the answers i got my conclusion
 conclusion is that first of all my question wasnt phrased right i shouldnt have said all religions i was only talking about judaism islam and christianity
second of all i got to the conclusion that only certain parts of religions are like cults and share plenty of similar traits in extremists parts of religions everyone for your help and time dedicated for me today",1,205,1203,41,0.024390243902439025
cmv people who wish to carry guns in public should have to attend a mandatory training session to learnpractice how to handle reallife situations active shooter being held up etc,in the us people are just going to have guns no matter what kind of bills get passed its just a culture that is very attached to guns people who would use them for ill purposes will usually be able to find a way to get them and people who wish to protect themselves from those people will arm themselves no matter what theyre told a gun in the hands of an illinformed poorly educated jittery person who has never in their life been in a highpressure lifethreatening situation where they had to act fast and decisively can make a bad situation more chaotic and dangerous so im putting forth the idea that anyone who wants to get a concealed carry license or even anyone who wants to own a gun should have to attend a training course to learn how to do just that as well as gun safety and if they dont pass it they arent able to get that gunconcealed carry license just like a driving test woah thanks for all the very informative comments i think weve pretty much covered the basic major reasons why this would not be effective and even make the problem worse in reality even if it seems like a good idea on paper id like to add that it turns out most states do require a bit of training to get a cw permit but i happen to live in a state which does not it would de facto violatehinder the 2nd amendment right beyond the argument some people have that any hurdles to owning a gun is actually a violation of this requiring people to pay  for the class get to the class buy the material to practicetake the class would all create barriers to obtaining an cw permit that would effectively be socioeconomically driven ie you could only get one if you had the means to take the test if the legislation wasnt done right some states could make taking and passing the test so prohibitive that it would essentially enact a gun ban at least to all except a certain class of people which would be even worse than no on having guns in my opinion having training doesnt mean that a person with a gun would improve any situation in fact having only some training might make a person without realworld experience think they were capable of handling a situation which in reality they were not and if they hadnt had that littlebitoftrainingconfidenceboost they probably would have just had the sense to stay out of it even if they were carrying a gun very good example of this is all the police out there who have drawn their weapon out of sheer fear and killed an innocent person honestly when someone made that point it alone was enough to make me realize that this training wouldnt change any statistics were a lot of other good points and i learned a lot but i think those are basically the two major reasons that pretty much made this argument a moot point at this point it seems like theres a lot of restating of these same points i thank you again for all your opinions and information you gave i really do not believe that the us should or can be a gunfree place i actually started thinking more about responsible gun ownership after my boyfriend got into them and made me start training some with them i realized through this discussion that i am actually carrying around some bias towards the stereotypical bible belt gun fanatic but that in actuality the majority of gun owners are responsible people who know their limits if you thought i was just trying to get on a preachy liberal soapbox then i hate to disappoint you know that your smartallecky comments did not add much to the conversation and keep having a great discussion,1,653,3724,186,0.021505376344086023

cmv copyright in the us and around the world should be 20 years and not 75 years,"the intended purpose of copyright is to give an incentive to create content but if you cant turn a profit in the first 2 decades then tough your content wasnt very good but the larger purpose of having a lengthy copyright is not to incentivize content but amass a huge library that in aggregate can still be profited from long after the original artists have likely moved on to other projects obvious downside is that there would be that financing of content would be disrupted there wouldnt be the willingness to sink costs upfront if there wasnt a chance for a lifetime of income from the copyright but i believe that this discourages content since content creating companies become overly dependent on their catalog of content rather than create new material i understand that making friends and seinfeld along with the beatles and notorious bigs  entire discography public domain would be the upside but what major downside would there be if the copyright would be limited to 20 years im not attached to the set years of copyright so thats going to be pedantic if you try to argue with me about it being 20 years but 30 years instead i want see why if any reason that we should continue to have steam boat willie not in the public domain and congress extending the copyright length every couple of decades since we are going to be due for another extension soon

cmv the american flag plays the same role as the image of chairman mao in china or ho chi minh in vietnam  it is a symbol of the state which is designed to develop strong nationalism to retain control,i come from england where you rarely see the union jack or the english flag anywhere outside of government buildings during the world cup or a few unusual people who have flagpoles actually having a flag on display is someones home has negative connotations  associated with ethnonationalism and by extension some farright views not saying i agree with this but it seems to be the prevailing view china the visage of chariman mao is everywhere and the same for ho chi minh in vietnam they have huge images of them in all government buildings and there is an image of them above the board in every classroom they are described as the father of the nation and ho chi minh is referred to as uncle ho my own belief for this is as a form of control  they both represent their own political parties and cultivate the feeling of trust towards the party in order to retain control this is done in schools in order to develop that belief from a young age i believe the us flag plays the same role within america have extensively travelled america and i have always found it rather jarring seeing the number of houses which have flag poles and flying old glory i also find it unusual that american school children have an american flag in their classroom or school which they pledge allegiance to to me it feels like attempting to brainwash children from a young age to be hypernationalistic and associate the american flag with themselves personally this is the government cultivating nationalism to retain control an attack on the us flag is an attack on american citizens this is apparent in situations such as when colin kaepernick took a knee against institutional racism in the us and cannot get a job because so many people are incensed that he disrespected the flag and therefore them personally,1,318,1829,202,0.0594059405940594
cmv all elected officials should have to swear on the constitution not a religious book,when it comes to publicly elected officials they all seem to swear on the bible quran etc the way i see it is that these people are making a promise to themselves to uphold core beliefs within their faith such as hard work perseverance honesty and a servants heart among other things while it will not entirely solve the problem i think that swearing on the constitution is a way that we can hold these people more accountable every single day politicians and other elected officials lie steal and cheat the people of this nation of course there are a few good eggs however i firmly believe a majority of these individuals are bought and paid for  a lot go in with a clear mind however when an organization like the nra no political bias here at all comes in and says “hey if you vote yes for this and no on this we will make a big donation to your reelection campaign” it corrupts the system the same thing could go for a liberal organization their votes can change dramatically when someone is putting money in their back pocket behind closed doors i think it is totally phony that these people swear on their selected book knowing that they are not going to uphold those standards i really respected kyrsten sinema of az when she swore on the constitution because that’s what these people are elected for to uphold the law of the land it shouldn’t be such a taboo thought to do this religion and politics are meant to be separate so why would swearing on these holy books be the first thing these people do you can hold religious standards for yourself without swearing on a book practicing those values is something you should do everyday if you follow a specific religion you shouldn’t have to swear on them to remind yourself to do so representation of everyone under the constitution is important and when officials are upholding christian muslim buddhist etc beliefs to the extent of everyone that’s wrong because we all believe differently besides the big things that most people agree on like not murdering stealing and so on swearing on the constitution ensures that everyone is included not just those who follow or agree with a specific belief system  i also understand that people are still going to have differences however if religion was kept out of politics those differences would be strictly political and not involving religious views i know religion does shape how people think but i try to look at it like law you have to keep your personal feelingsbeliefs out of the way and uphold the law because the law doesn’t care how you feel it’s about doing the right thing so that justice can be served,1,469,2664,90,0.05555555555555555

cmv judging christians on the actions of pedophile priests is no different than judging muslims on the actions of islamic terrorists  both are wrong,just in case anyone gets the twisted idea that i’m supporting these wicked people i’m not at all every single pedophile regardless of race or creed should face the full arm of the law simple a few articles got pretty popular on rnews about pedophile priests being arrested that’s great it spreads the important message that even those who we are taught to trust aren’t all truthful and can be truly evil what’s not so great in my opinion is the slew of comments denouncing not the pedophile priests but the faith itself calling all contemporary christians evil hatred people now of course there are evil christians of course there is do they represent everyone no the faith is so diverse that no two christians are alike truly don’t see a difference between this and calling all muslims terrorist both pedophile priests and islamic terrorists maintain a sick sense of twisted morality where they wrongly use their religion to justify their actions someone calls all muslims terrorists or uses the actions of a terrorist to label the islamic faith they are condemned rightfully so yet when people judge christianity on the actions of pedophile priests there is no sort of backlash only an echo chamber of people filled with hatred don’t get me wrong there is nothing wrong with joking about these topics in the right atmosphere however the comments that i’ve recently seen go beyond a joke and are purely spiteful and disgusting against the wrong people my view has been changed all thank you to everyone who took the time to respond i’ll still be responding if anyone wants to know why my view has been changed it’s because some people have made clear the distinction between an apparent institutionalisation in some christian denominations whereas terrorism in islam is distanced,1,302,1855,150,0.05333333333333334
cmv it is hurting your child to not be open with them about things like religion drugs and sex,"i feel that without bring open to your child you’re causing them problems in the long run the more mystery is surrounding a topic the more interest a kid has in it obviously don’t start talking to your kids about sex and drugs at 8 years old but at an appropriate age  people want to believe their kids will never have sex or never drink or try drugs which may be true in some cases but if it does happen i think they need to be aware that teenagers try things  example sex if you’re not open with you’re kid about sex and offer to buy them condoms or allow them to be on birth control or whatever else you’re going to hurt them in the long run by making them believe it is a “bad” thing

cmv netflix is becoming less of a way to cut the cable and more like just another premium cable service like hbo,here are my views by focusing on original content netflix is becoming less of an alternative to a cable subscription and more of just another albeit amazing and unparalleled hbo type service due to this and the glut of other subscription streaming services the dream of drastically lower costs for the average consumer by cutting the cable while retaining most of the benefits of a traditional television are slipping away to the realities of a fragmented subscription market netflix came out and started gaining steam the was a lot of talk about how it would possibly replace traditional expensive cable bills  but as the market has developed it seems to me that netflix has changed  if i look at how ive used netflix over the past couple years it is almost entirely driven by their original programming  and indeed this is what netflix wants and i do love their original shows  but it isnt replacing cable for me  i dont really watch their movietv show selection much anymore because ive already seen most of what im interested in  narcos and stranger things and unbreakable kimmy schmidt are great but they are just fleshing out the lineup of shows i like in conjunction with all the other shows that i can only get with my 100 a month cable subscription  i also like to watch the walking dead and game of thrones and the news  if i want to watch the new star trek now i have to shell out even more money for another subscription service  if i want to watch sports i need either an expensive subscription 40 just for sports or my normal cable subscription  now disney is starting their own subscription service as well  if i want hulus offerings that is another subscription  my point is that yes if netflix had been allowed to grow without competition it would be great to have one company dominate streaming and have all the content in one place for one cost  but obviously other companies want to get in on it too expect the main counterargument to this is that you dont need every scrap of content out there so you can cut the cable and just get by with less entertainment  fair enough  but that isnt really fulfilling my dream of cable cutting  i didnt envision that these services would morph into a low budget option for people who can live with less content than they used to get  in fact i suspect that in this age of streaming options most people will spend roughly the same amount for tv entertainment as before  because most people i know are still going to keep their cable subscription and supplement it with a couple streaming options of their choice  realistically i dont think we are in for an age of drastically lower prices  it is a great option for a low budget or a college kid who can now get a lot of value for 10 a month but i bet the average person doesnt save any money in this new age of streaming  so after reading all of your really well thought out comments i still think i retain my view  however i do have a greater understanding of what cable cutting is for most people  i appreciate more that netflixs trajectory is just fine for a lot of people  and that if you dont care about certain specific aspects of live tv news sports etc then it really is possible to pay less and get rid of your cable bill  but i still believe that we arent really in a new paradigm of cable cutting like some predicted until subscription services are the default instead of cable most people i know for what its worth are going to keep both  and due to realities of the business that many of you pointed out it isnt netflixs goal to fill every niche  so hopefully we can all agree that the view i expressed isnt really wrong but it misses the point this is a footnote from the cmv moderators wed like to remind you of a couple of things firstly please read through our rules if you see a comment that has broken one it is more effective to report it than downvote it speaking of which downvotes dont change views any questions or concerns feel free to message us happy cmving,1,759,4361,117,0.05982905982905983
cmv the majority of government economic disaster relief funds should go directly to the consumer not to corporations,whenever there is a major economic disaster as opposed to the natural kinds financial fear can spread quickly and cause consumers to scale back spending cash flow dries up and the economy grinds to a halt governments can jumpstart the economy by appropriating funds and injecting liquidity which acts like financial grease of relief funding should go directly to individuals and families not corporations exceptions follow below heres why  it is far more efficient to rescue an economy by helping the consumer than it is by giving the same amount to corporations the consumer will spend the money where they need it most which will incentivize companies to supply those needs and do so efficiently imagine that there are two farms  one farm raises chickens and produces eggs and another that only makes artisanal cheese from the rare milk of wild siberian grassfed goats if you give 10 families each 20 they will likely reward the chicken farm with most of that 200 buying their chickens and eggs but if instead you give each farm 100 the chicken farm producing the product in highest demand at this time will not get the funds they could use to expand their operations hire additional workers and better serve the community there may be a need to target specific industries but it should be evaluated for health and safety reasons not for mere convenience hospitals are one example where one can make a reasonable argument that their financial viability serves the public good the relief funds to the consumer and allow them to direct it to the products and services that are the most  valuable for them the money gets spent and will still go to businesses  and corporations but this way maintains market efficiencies while still  achieving in the desired outcomes,1,304,1839,119,0.03361344537815126

cmv trump will retain the vast majority of his supporters 80 no matter what he says or does,"given how his base has remained largely intact despite the jawdropping things he says and does i dont think donald trump will lose more than 20 of his current supporters for any reason a few things to make my view clearer i define supporter as anyone who would selfidentify that way andor is currently planning to vote for trump so someone who doesnt like him as a politician or leader but is planning on voting republican at the federal level would count such a person might fall under the 20 who would possibly change their mind
 i realise 80 is an arbitrary number but i thought it best to put a figure beside vast majority i think that 20 can account for swing voters and those who arent really committed to being his base order to change my view you have to convince me that there is something trump could feasibly say or do that would cause him to lost more than that amount of support note that this doesnt have to be something that will happen or even is likely to happen just that it is feasible according to five thirty eight trumps current approval rating is 441 so looked at that way if my math is correct that number would have to drop to 35 for that to happen if you have a better way of defining the loss of 15 of his supporters i am open to it thank you everyone for your responses between work and having a newborn at home i do not have time respond to most people and for that i apologize i would like to clear up a few things that have come up in the comments i am not american the democrats are not my camp and i did not particularly like clinton and i certainly do not like biden if he were running in my country he would likely be a conservative but thats sort of besides the point there have been a lot of assumptions made about me and a lot of people have sought to reflexively defend trump without really addressing the point of this post in an effort to change my view if anything this reinforces my point
2 related to the first point some people have said that the devotion shown to trump is equally mirrored on the democrat side as an outsider looking in on america i do not believe this is true nor do i believe it is true in my country nor even of the republicans to this degree a few years ago  i would not be making this post if say mitt romney was president right now i do not believe there was this level of fervent and undying devotion to clinton bush jr and obama they had their diehards dont get me wrong  every president does  but the cult of personality around trump is in my opinion unprecedented this is of course exacerbated and modelled by trump himself who will not tolerate any disagreement or even open questioning of his words or actions in the media or in his own administration again at a level i have never seen outside of dictatorships there is a false equivalency about how dems and republicans fall in line behind their leaders that this post goes over nicely  it is objectively untrue that democrats rally around their leaders and change their opinions on topics to suit that purpose the same way republicans do
3 a lot of people have made the argument that a very large amount of his supporters only support him because they believe they had no alternative as people deeply opposed to democratic policies while that might describe a few people i just dont buy that it makes up a big enough voting bloc to meet the threshold of this post they had the choice of many other gop candidates who would have basically towed the line on republican issues but they chose trump please understand that one of the main reasons that i have this belief is because i dont believe trump is a conservative at all this post sums up nicely why its so bizarre why conservatives support him  hes not an anything he is a vacuum a populist and demagogue
4 some people have convinced me somewhat the number one thing i think would get it done is if he actually took peoples guns without due process i dont think just saying he would do it would get it done because hes already said it and while it hurt his support it didnt cause a big enough drop i think he would have to actually take the guns abortion also came up but i think he would have to support prochoice very vocally for that to happen",1,800,4978,97,0.041237113402061855
cmv our current presidential debate formats are pointless and need to be overhauled,straight and to the point as i’m sure anyone who has watched both debates would know why this is being posted  microphones should be cut off after the candidates time runs out if you have 2 minutes you have 2 minutes once your time runs out the microphone cuts off and it moves to the next personmoderator  while another candidate is speaking the opponents microphone should be muted so there will be no interruptions refusal to answer a question leads to a warning and if the candidate continues the microphone is cut off and the remaining time is taken away  non answers are called out by the moderators no more allowing a candidate to speak for 2 minutes about something unrelated and not giving an answer moderators should pause a candidates time and microphone ask that they answer the question at hand and then allow them to continue  misinformation should be fact checked in real time if a candidate says something false the moderator should be able to go back and inform the viewers that said statement is incorrect and provide them with the facts there should be a round that allows candidates to challenge each other they can both ask each candidate a few questions which are pre screened by the committee so there are no personal attacks on family and such this would be the round where they can call out the others policies voting habits bad faith statements etc  think this would dramatically enhance our debates and make it so the american people actually gain value from these debates obviously these are weird times but that doesn’t mean we need to just have hour and a half long pointless arguments the first presidential debate was one of the worst things i have ever seen  need moderators who are not afraid to cut off candidates and call them out no more “thank you for this question but let me talk about something else for two minutes” these are serious issues people want to know about we don’t want to hear you give us the same 4 answers for an hour and a half  should be forced to give answers relate to the questions otherwise what is the point of these debates this blew up way more than i thought it would i did my best to answer as many responses as i could i appreciate the good conversations at the end of the day all that really matters is everyone doing your research beyond these debates get to know the topics that matter to you and make sure to vote,1,439,2481,84,0.047619047619047616

cmv the a character should be voiced by a voice actor of the same race issue going around doesnt make sense and is hypocritical,"view has been changed


 big edit thank you for all the upvotes also i have been rightfully corrected by many commenters and i want to set the record straight 
this isnt really about accurate casting but about giving nonwhite voice actors more opportunity to test their skills and represent minorities in general have been severely underrepresented in media not just in cartoons as an asian who loves film i would love to see more asian actors and actresses on the screen  the characters race is a vital part of hisher story then the race of the va should take high priority  post actors such as jenny slate and allison brie stepping down from their roles on cartoon shows big mouth and bojack horseman respectively i feel like i have to speak out against this current trend the argument that a voice actor can only play a character of hisher same race is fundamentally flawed in the current and historical state of voice acted media what ive noticed is that the only voice actors getting called out for this are white but if this was truly a all race issue then why havent these other voice actors been called out samurai jack is played by phil lamarr a black voice actor most of the main cast of avatar the last airbender are played by white voice actors if this discussion was truly about all races must be played by their respective race then why havent these shows been called out in my opinion this is a whitewashing issue but its not even really whitewashing all im asking is for the people pushing this forward should be consistent in their judgement but i feel like if there was an animated show with an all asian cast played by mexican voice actors no one would bat an eye because the voice actors arent white i see now that most of my argument complains about things that have already happened and cant change lets switch the conversation to look towards the future 2 its been brought to my attention that actors who are involved in this debate such as slate and brie voluntarily spoke out thats my mistake i was under the assumption that they had been called out by the internet which led them to act 3 this topic is less about who plays who but about more nonwhite voice actor representation there are so many talented nonwhite voice actors that lose a chance at a role because a white actor gets chosen instead 5 this issue is complex and should be judged on a casebycase basis",1,436,2504,132,0.030303030303030304

 if an american born person with no political experience or qualifications can become president why cant an immigrant who has citizenship and a good political experience not become president america is great the main part because of its diversity but where is the logic behind not letting an american become president just because of their birth in a different nation  whole point of democracy as i understand it is to give the people the voice on who will lead them and it seems that americans dont care too much for the place of birth for example ted cruz was runner up for the republican nomination even though was born in canada same for john mccain as he was born in panama point is that it would do no harm for this country to let non naturally born people become president and it would let a good amount of new smart people have the chance to lead the united states",1,189,1042,113,0.05309734513274336

cmv job postings should be legally required to include the minimum pay rate offered,job vacancy advertisements should have to include a minimum pay rate that the employer is willing to offer so that job seekers immediately know what to expect for a wage range prior to applying requirement should be in a commonsense format like minimum 850hr 45000 annually or commissions only but minimum wage guaranteed  probably would have to forbid benefits from being mixed in to make the direct gross pay rate look bigger already has a similar law regarding advertisements for lending offers bs things like your earning potential is limited only by your drive to succeed as a maximum is a separate issue from my proposition first guess is that some kind of obfuscating phrase like 725hr for completely inexperienced candidates much more for any experience might become commonplace at first because so many shyster hr departments would want to circumvent the spirit of the law  but i would guess that eventually the work force would come to associate that phrase with thats gonna be a lowpaying job much like we now associate the lie we work hard and we play hard with the reality that theyll just work the dog shit out of you  and then the betterpaying employers will eventually realize it helps them to actually advertise their higher pay and wage competition within industries will increase seems to me that this would help put upwards pressure on wages pleasing the left through freemarket competition pleasing the right just by mandating that the truth be disclosed up front which should please everyone  it would also very slightly reduce structural unemployment because job seekers would waste less time wading through applying for interviewing for and sometimes even accepting jobs that they later discover pay relatively too little am i not taking into consideration in my fantasy my first edit because i didnt know deltas were autologged getting a lot of great perspectives and info here hard to keep up but on the plus side that gives others a chance to rebut and bolster comments besides me  forgive me as i try to keep up and thanks to most of you for staying civil udadthemaskedterror commented on a link to a california law that is already moving in this direction  one thing thats tripping a lot of new folks up its currently common for companies to advertise for one job posting then come across a candidate who is absolutely unqualified but they want to hire him for a different position  this law wouldnt prohibit that in fact a delta went to a commenter who pointed out that this law would have the additional benefit of encouraging companies to write more accurate job postings and think more deliberately about who they want to attract which benefits everyone,1,463,2944,85,0.047058823529411764
cmv this is a racial cultural socioeconomic and police brutality issue not just a single one of them,"recently i have been seeing many posts suggesting that its only one of these issues there can be multiple issues and multiple solutions to this problem 
 want to start by explaining why i think its a racial issue followed by socioeconomic status then culture and lastly police brutality
 think that this is an issue that goes back to the beginning of america for centuries black people have been oppressed slavery was immensely damaging to the black family this is not comparable to how the chinese were treated and how the irish were indentured servants  also the confederate constitution specifically singles out african negroes as slaves not irish people also neither country was ravaged as heavily as african countries by european people  in any case after literal lifetimes of slavery black folks were hit very harshly with jim crow laws which didnt end until the 1950s the origins of gangs with african americans actually started because they had to defend themselves from racists while also trying to make a dollar  final factor encouraging gang formation was the chicago race riot of 1919 in which gangs of white youth terrorized the black community and in response black youth formed groups for selfprotection60 quote  antiblack violence on the part of white youths directly contributed to black youths forming selfprotection societies that transformed into black gangs by the late 1960s61 wikipedia page theres redlining which still hurts some minorities today the war on drugs was specifically targeted to harm black people  so many racist laws and practices were put into effect and still affect so many black families today black folks were oppressed for so long and then pretty much expected to catch up and build on a foundation that racist society effectively shattered and did not take adequate measures to repair also according to yales empirical analysis of racial differences in police while the police shoot and murder black and white folks at roughly the same rate controlled for different factors they also found that black and hispanic folks are 50 more likely to be subject to some force when being arrested the study suggests that when controlled for contextual and behavioral factors the number is reduced but still doesnt explain racial disparities this has the same abstract section furthermore yale concluded that while being compliant and no arrest has been made black people are 213 more likely to be subject to force  this article points out some disparities in drug use blacks in our study were more likely to be incarcerated on charges explicitly labeled as drugrelated blacks would also be more likely to suffer the collateral consequences specifically associated with drug charges such as exclusion from certain forms of financial aid housing benefits and job screening scrutiny  response to the current opioid epidemic a public health crisis with a “white face” has been contrasted to the crack epidemic that hit black communities hard in the 90s and was met with war tactics in affected communities rather than compassion for offenders black and white people use and sell drugs at the same rate black people are punished more for it source 2 ironically in the study linked above it showed that in that particular city black people were more interested in marijuana as opposed to white people who were more interested in heroin black drug offenders also get sentenced more harshly  black people are more likely to have their cars searched and less likely to be explained a reason why a rhode island study also showed they were likely to be stopped and somehow less likely to receive a citation to me this suggests that they were effectively stopped for no reason a study in new york city showed that blacks were more likely than whites or nonblack minorities to be in jail while they await trial even after controlling for the seriousness of charges and prior record black people are also 13 more likely to receive a plea deal that included longer jail time again controlling for factors such as prior record researchers found that north carolina prosecutors were excluding black people from juries in capital cases at twice the rate of other jurors even when controlling for legitimate justifications for striking jurors such as employment status or reservations about the death penalty black convicts have their probation revoked more often than whites and other minorities according to a study of probation outcomes in iowa new york oregon and texas these racial disparities held even when the study controlled for other characteristics of the probationers such as their age crime severity and criminal history source even disparities in speeding tickets and frisk is also widely considered to be a racist policy directly attributed to blacks being unable to move from poorer areas to nicer neighborhoods and gain wealth through owning property in nicer neighborhoods it also prevented their children and future generations from accessing better schools

 implicit racial bias plays a big role in black kids underperforming

 

 status studies have shown black people are directly harmed because of their socioeconomic status even in health care redlining and poor schools did not help with this while a lot of people enjoying citing that black people commit substantially more crimes than white people they forget to acknowledge the context surrounding black people besides just the racial element we see that crime is heavily linked to poverty and the rate of poverty among black people is quite high while it is true that poor white people still commit less crimes they also seem to live in less densely populated areas as well for example centreville illinois has a population of about 5000 according to the census and a population density of 1170 and 95 of the people who live there are black the crime rates are 72 higher than the national average similar results were found for selma alabama it may also be attributed to a culture  study finds that the gross rates of violence are two and a half to five times greater in the three types of nonwhite neighborhoods than in white areas 5 but these differences drop to a maximum of one and three quarters after critical community conditions are taken into account table 2  these ccommunity conditions seem to be differences in access to external resources such as home loans and socioeconomic disadvantages
 status has been proven to be one of the best predictors for success study showing it’s just as important as cognitive ability and personality traits

 are directly influenced by their environment they dont just appear out of thin air and they certainly arent genetic there are no inherent genetic differences such as being more prone to violence either this notion has been denounced by anthropologists and biologists alike and no humans are not like dog breeds and that is a historically racist analogy the number of loci analyzed is the most critical variable with 100 polymorphisms accurate classification is possible but ω remains sizable even when using populations as distinct as subsaharan africans and europeans phenotypes controlled by a dozen or fewer loci can therefore be expected to show substantial overlap between human populations this provides empirical justification for caution when using population labels in biomedical settings with broad implications for personalized medicine pharmacogenetics and the meaning of race source from the same report in a reanalysis of data from 377 microsatellite loci typed in 1056 individuals europeans proved to be more similar to asians than to other europeans 38 of the time another quote  it is also compatible with our finding that even when the most distinct populations are considered and hundreds of loci are used individuals are frequently more similar to members of other populations than to members of their own population thus caution should be used when using geographic or genetic ancestry to make inferences about individual phenotypes
 no black folks dont just disregard education because they arent genetically capablehere is an article i find interesting the various studies cited in the article found is that black students value education as much or even slightly more than their white counterparts in any case i believe that this culture is a direct result of racism a society that was once extremely racist held black people down and it effectively molded the culture that others now deem ghetto for example the gangs i mentioned above and also more unfair practices even into the 90s lots of people dont realize that only until half a century or so ago blacks were effectively not allowed to buy houses in many cities redlining is not an ancient practice realtors and city lawmakers got together in the early to mid 20th century and literally drew lines where black people and other nonwhites were allowed to live outside the line and nobody would sell you a house banks wouldnt give you a mortgage regardless of your ability to pay typically the minority districts didnt have much real estate for sale as it was mostly rental property so you have multiple generations of people barred from building up any kind of equity or wealth parents unable to help save their children from financial ruin people having to rely on welfare to survive welfare is tricky because its a system designed to keep you reliant on it
id argue the current hood culture is a direct result of racist policies like redlining as well as misguided wellintentioned social engineering creation of housing projects welfare system in the 1960s the end of slavery black people have beenand continue to be either in law or in practicesubject to housing discrimination mortgage discrimination job discrimination exclusion from political representation police brutality the schooltoprison pipeline the prisonindustrial complex and so on and so forth prejudice and disenfranchisement in turn contribute to worse health outcomes the cycle of poverty and limited social mobility idea of a black culture as the single cause of systemic poverty of black americans is fairly incoherent it assumes that there is some uniform black culture with stable features and asserts that the characteristics of that culture account for some unique varianceover and above other factorsin the present socioeconomic conditions of black people this portion was an answer from a redditor a while back note that i am only referring to the negative aspects of the culture that people like to refer to rnb rock and roll soul disco house and jazz originated with black peopleculture for example also one of the biggest disadvantages that is specific to black americans is the removal of their culture and heritage african immigrants are more likely to have a college degree than the average american as a user mentioned earlier i failed to acknowledge black fathers not purposely though i was just caught up with other issues  to this statistics show that close to 70 percent of all births to black mothers are nonmarital giving rise to the stereotype that black fathers are largely absent however while black fathers are less likely than white and hispanic fathers to marry their childs mother many black fathers continue to parent through cohabitation and visitation providing caretaking financial and inkind support 


 brutality and by extension inappropriate actions have addressed a lot of this above so i have less to say about it it is undeniable that police brutality can occur to anyone and it has i think a problem equally as large is how easy they get off though the same yale study i mentioned above actually suggests that it is quite rare for police officers to be held accountable even jimmy atchisons philandro castiles tamir rices breonna taylors though her situation is recent and eric garners murderers have been fired at worst i mean even this man also even at the protests there are several instances of unprovokedunwarranted violence from the police for instance example 1

 example 3not police violence but a questionable act  4

 trivialized  you come and you’re good  what do you expect a back massage   risk of generalizing the sexual psychological experience of many male sexuality is neither animalistic nor gamelike nor silly it’s a strong part of who men are and it can be complex or painful or transcendent just like the sexuality of women  example take the perverted addiction aspect of male sexuality men are very visually and physically guided as a couple studies have shown eg chung et al 2013 book by paul martin men can be very susceptible to porn addiction this isn’t necessarily fun and isn’t always a choice  it can be a powerful unconscious impulse men may feel stigmatized in getting help or talking about this our society either ignores the unconscious objectifying aspects of male sexuality or completely extremifies it  comparing all men to weinstein or charlie sheen  example is sexual pleasure men with circumcisions may feel much less sexual pleasure than females and have far weaker orgasms  yet this completely unacknowledged by media outlets  i would argue contemporary psychologists as well but that’s debatable the thought of trying to help men have better orgasms feels crazy in our current societal climate  yet helping women  absolutely  men may value the intimacy and shared pleasure of sex just as much as women all the media tropes of men sleeping around hating cuddling etc may keep our partners from adequately valuing and supporting those needs  summarize male sexuality can be objectifying and unconscious but it is either completely disregarded or treated to extremes perverts  charlie sheen male sexual pleasure is sometimes trivialized or outright considered taboo see circumcisions  and should be treated as important and talked about in the same light as sex positivity movements for women  could change my mind by explaining why i’m being overly reductive about male sexuality  or show me strong examples of male sex positivity  or explain why our society should be prioritizing discussions of female sexuality over men’s  realize that i have a slant slants here that people may take issue with i may come off as blaming women i’m making no arguments about who’s fault it is  in fact it’s probably men’s fault because we need to be the ones brave enough to talk about it i may come off as completely unrepresentative of male homosexual or transexual experiences please enlighten me in both cases i wish to learn more and help correct my gaps and ignorances deltas i’m taking a break for a little while some takeaways from my discussions below i should host these discussions from a place of “yesand” instead of pitting male vs female sexuality against each other  also in many places cultures and contexts in our world the treatment of female sexuality is so backward and repressive that it makes perfect sense to prioritize femalecentered movements lastly for understanding my own male heterosexuality i should look into communities here on reddit like rmenslib and talk openly to people i trust

cmv all hidden costs including tax should be included in consumer prices,us has weird habit of not including sales taxes in products they sell in stores this is confusing and makes almost impossible to estimate your expenditure i know that they do this mainly for two reasons one is that taxes varies between regions and other is that they dont have to tell you how much the product actually costs and can advertise a lower price i go buy anything i want to know how much it will cost me dont have issue with taxes only but other hidden costs as well i get upset when i have to pay mandatory handing fees cloakroom tickets package fees etc just last week i bought two concert tickets and had to pay a delivery fee for an eticket i had to pay them for each ticket i printed myself this is nonsensical i understand if the hidden cost is something that is dependent on the whole purchase like for example postage cost this is fixed cost that gets lower more you buy and cannot be directly added to the products cost but if you have to pay the cost independently from your other purchases that price should be added to the items cost argument i can think for this kind of system is corporate customers they will pay taxes  separately and pay the lower price of the items but that is why the title said that consumer prices should be clear please dont make a bandwagon argument this is system we have deal with it that is not a productive comment i know that changes has to made to laws but better consumer protection is always worth it change my view show me a benefit for a consumer of showing a lower price that they actually mandatory has to pay many of you are pointing out that it is hard to make nation wide advertisement that includes the local tax first of all most adds can be localized with ease those that cannot should include the highest possible price and something like this or lower and nothing like this doesnt mean that the actual store couldnt include the actual price in their stickers that cost is non existent for the store utuxed0mask pointed out interesting fact tshirt at german hm and in france hm will cost the same amount to end consumer they have same sticker price can use same advertisement material etc all this despite the german having different tax code vat than france so this shouldnt be a issue,1,419,2354,75,0.05333333333333334

2 people who point out that injustice and evil in the world thrives when individuals espouse my selfish perspective  i have considered this carefully however many of those comments are either asking me to do things i already do stuff that i consider to be under my micro heading or are not clearly offering me any alternative actions to take i find some of those responses to be full of campy rhetoric insubstantial and unconvincing for example lets use 1930s germany as an instance to explore this perspective suppose i were a welltodo citizen of some means and i saw nazis taking over my reaction would most likely have been to sell all my assets take a pile of cash and bail out with my family this was not an uncommon practice many people simply ran away from the nazis one could argue that had more stayed and fought things would have been different but i dunnoa large angry mob with guns vs some civilians standing up for whats right which side ends up with more casualties instead the runners were able to live and have children and grandchildren scientists left and worked on the atom bomb for the us isnt it better to live through the situation than die meaninglessly one death the hypothetical me in this case is inconsequential but the life of someone keeping their head down and in the extreme case running away can have far more utility
3 people who are working on the phrase it is acceptable to  it can be pointed out that this is mostly just semantics but i asked this question not because i had doubts about my perspective more like i wanted to take the temperature of a larger community to see where i stand it sounds like most of you would agree that it is acceptable and thus my view is unchanged",1,775,4363,139,0.02877697841726619
cmv class and wealth distribution are more important then issues of race and would be more effective to focus on in order to get positive change corporate america will always focus us on race rather then class,obviously racism exists and it is a problem i am not arguing about that  i just think it is the lesser of two evils  i think we are sort of missing the point with these protests  i think democrats will back them 100 because they know they get easy votes from it  obviously as you read on i voted for bernie and i dont know for sure what would have happened if he got elected it is hard to trust any politician especially national ones because all you see is them on tv  but i am curious if i am missing something here  i like to say corporate democrats basically the democratic party will use identity politics and social issues as sort of their crutch to get elected  but when push comes to shove they will not do much for working class lower income people  they will be mostly bought and paid for by large corporations and special interests and wont rock the boat too much  now i think they are the lesser of two evils when it comes to democrat vs republican sure and they do at least pass some policies probably just the bare minimum to keep their base happy and to get enough votes will admit i dont have a ton of specialist knowledge in politics but i do listen and consume what i would like to think is a vast array of content that contains perspectives from right to left up and down  and have for years  i do my best to avoid echo chambers and to really try and listen to all opinions regardless of source  i understand some people think of obama as a hero and someone with true class  i will admit he speaks well and by all public facing evidence is a gentleman  but is he much better than a corporate shill  what besides obamacarewhich he 100 had to do or else why would anyone vote for a democrat again has he done for the poor and disenfranchised we really being bamboozled by corporations into buying into lesser narratives like a race war in order to avoid talking about the larger and more impactful issues of class discrimination and massive wealth distribution inequality  i think corporations and corporate democrats will always talk about race because it is a social issue and so long as they make their solidarity posts and maybe hire a minority leader they will quell the mob and the mob wont talk about how they refuse to allow unions or provide decent healthcare or a decent wage regardless of race  race keeps the lower class divided and it keeps corporations out of the public eye   i think liberal mediacnn cbs etc aka corporate media will continually push the race war narrative because it is in their best interest my view,1,490,2612,212,0.02358490566037736
cmv research surrounding vaccines should never be in a situation where it can be stolen and should be readily accessible to scientists around the world,while the title is selfexplanatory i woke up this morning to the news that the united states was accusing china of attempting to steal their covid vaccine data i recognize that there are situations where states may not want their information taken by other state actors see defense information from the us and china however especially amidst a global pandemic where  over 15 million people have been diagnosed and over 600000 people have died from the virus google covid statistics it is unethical in my mind to withhold research information that could bring the world to a successful vaccine believe there is a sort of historical precedence both for and against this but the best comparison i am able to make is how jonas salk the creator of the polio vaccine refused to patent his discovery due to the morality of such a choice with a quote akin to would you patent the sun here is a source that sums it up though if you can find a better one please let me know while this isnt vaccine research the point stands that if there is access to lifealtering technology it should be shared not sold or kept a secret get we live in a capitalist society but morally i cannot fathom this lack of sharing knowledge even if initial costs are high wouldnt costs overall decrease as more people have access to it i would like to clarify that my concerns while stemming from news that came out today are more holistic in not sharing medical research that can have significant impacts on global communities cancer research malaria vaccines hiv arvs are all great examples a generous amount of deltas and explanations will be coming out shortly there is a lot of good information in here and i strongly recommend you take a read through it a lot of people are getting hung up on the morality of healthcare costs  which i am sure in some facet we can agree on that this conversation is focused on the sharing of knowledge to create vaccines and treatments not their subsequent costs thanks everyone who continues to share their thoughts the scholar in me is going through making notes and of course always researching ill continue my replies as promptly as possible,1,383,2796,155,0.025806451612903226

 to my main point ive lived in the us in the past for around 5 years and id say i watch a lot of world news following social economic and scientific views and problems the recent blm movement in the us makes sense and i do support it however what doesnt make sense to me is the acab movement and the blm movement as of today they say they should defund the police among other things such as how every single cop is bad rather than spending more on their education and making stricter passing conditions like other 1st world countriesmost countries have academy training that spans years with yearly retests additionally ive seen news on how people of the movement are looting and destroying the businesses of their own community which doesnt make sense to me at all ive also seen many people on the blm side complaining about whites and insulting them isnt this exactly what they were protesting in the first place conclusion us politics for me seems like a mess that is highly hypocritical yes in the us the most major form of racism is arguably racism against poc but everything seems far left or far right with no middle ground not every cop is bad like how not every teacher or politician is bad yes there is a much higher percentage of bad cops in the us but using the word all makes little sense to me additionally not all white people are racist and pocs can definitely be racist too but the solutions each group seem to be making are absolute ideals with no consideration of a middle greyarea argument politically this would be called as centrism which has its own faults but i believe is still better than what is going on at the moment not white vs black its everyone vs racism if it were to be white vs black what would you say about the white people who died fighting against the confederates i also see people saying but youre an exception we dont include you in  isnt that the same as unconsciously admitting the flaws in your statement there are people saying reverseracism doesnt exist whilst going full circle and being racist and judging people who dont believe their ideas this however does not mean i support all lives matter i believe this because i know that alm was born as a very flawed counter argument against blm similar situation i believe that exists within the us is the feminists vs men when it should actually be everyone vs sexists everyone vs racism since everyone vs racists doesnt make sense grammatically
 
edit 2 centrism not centralism and other typos 3 after reading many of the comments i have improved my opinion on acab and a better understanding of blm however i still inherently believe that these acronyms are a very dangerous way of addressing problems as they can be easily misunderstood and there should be a better solution the blm is a movement as a whole i still think that because it operates under different viewpointsinterpretations by different people it has its weaknesses i still fully support it under its core cause but i think it has veered off course in multiple ways 4 makes sense not complete sense ive also seen people mention my asian background and saying that its part of the problem im not trying to use it for anything or to change anyones opinion on how they should read my post im just mentioning to say that i am not asianamerican i am culturally attached to asia but i do have better understanding of the western world compared to the rest of my people this is purely an outsiders point of view one that can have no direct influence as again since im not american i cant vote for american politics i can only state my opinion",1,763,4452,57,0.14035087719298245
cmv rpizzadare is a subreddit showcasing and glorifying sexual assault of mainly workingclass men it should be banned,"here is the sub i’m referencing rpizzadare obviously tldr is that nude women get off on opening the door for delivery people or room service sometimes forcing them to interact touch them or watch them perform sexual acts my opinion this is significantly worse than say a dick pic which many would agree to be quite offensive if not actual assault  a because it is done in person b because they are in middle of doing their jobs which means the victims either cannot disengage or face repercussions if they choose to do so now obviously there are some instances where the men appear to enjoy the encounter or even get sexually involved with the women although a good number of those seem staged but i do not believe that excuses the vast majority of these situations in which the victim feels awkward and doesn’t know what to do with themselves not to mention the invasion of privacy of being listed in a sexual video on the internet know the super woke on twitter might object to this line of reasoning but if the genders were reversed i 100 believe the cops would be called and the guy would be labeled a pervert and sex offender his life would be ruined a subreddit glorifying and specializing assault on innocent people trying to do their jobs in peace is just beyond me it is clear that some of the women are being encouraged to perform these acts by others in the subreddit and therefore i believe banning the sub will directly decrease the amount of men getting assaulted in this manner

cmv social media is a problem because it gives stupid people power,disclaimer i do not wish to offend anybody nor am i saying that i am particularly smart theory average person is pretty stupid and a very large number of people is even more stupid than that and lets further say that 810 of those very dumb people think that theyre actually not dumb but in fact they think themselves rather clever this in turns make them extremely vocal about their views and opinions  because heck why not they are smart right they have all the answers and want to share them with the world before social media those people were a contained problem they were the weird guy in the pub or the kid on the playground who wouldnt shut up about conspiracy theories you could simply ignore them or tell them you werent interested since social media it has become as easy as never before in human history to inflict your opinion on the world you just twitter away  you blow your 2 cents into the aether and guess what  youre very quickly and easily going find someone that thinks alike that is the problem stupid people are becoming a force to be reckoned with not because they are right about something but because they are collectively stupid and that gives them power of the one weirdo you could just ignore you have hundreds or in some cases even thousands of people who are organizing themselves and are spreading their message  the best example i can think of here are flat earthers youve read until here  cheers  i have read through all the comments and answered a fair bit of them i havent responded to any of you its probably because it would only serve to repeat myself please dont think me not replying has anything to do with me not appreciating your input almost all the comments have been very constructive and insightful i have very much enjoyed this discussion with all of you thanks a lot ,1,336,1933,67,0.07462686567164178
cmv divorce is not a tragedy a tragedy is staying in an unhappy marriage,here are my reasons why staying in an unhappy marriage is worse than getting a divorce especially with children involved and i am not going to address marriages that contain abuse drug use or financial irresponsibility im just referring to marriages that have become roommate situations at best daily fights at worst you will not grow is an opportunity to encourage one another to become a better person than you were yesterday it should be a place of mutual respect and support but if you are in a marriage with a disconnected unsupportive nagging etc spouse any growth you make will be survival skills you will likely become depressed often assume that someone is lonely if they are alone but id argue that sometimes the feeling of being alone when you are with someone is much worse that feeling of knowing things shouldnt be this way that youve tried and tried and you are still stuck and have no means of making the marriage work and just pass each day as comanagers of shared life logistics is depressing as hll the inability to fix a marriage will make this worse and while there are thousands upon thousands of counselors and books and classes and talks about fixing your marriage in truth they rarely work  you will have a negative impact on your kids so much to tackle here so ill just cover the most salient points kids will learn what marriage looks like from you if you are modeling a badunhappyunhealthy marriage for your kids the best they can do in their own future marriage if they even want to be married after witnessing yours is to use your marriage as an example of what not to do some say that they dont fight in front of the kids so its not hurting them well kids pick up on the negative emotions in the room you dont have to raise your voice or slam a door to know mommy and daddy cant stand one another and if you grow up in a family where the parental foundation is really a shaky facade the kids will be raised feeling insecure about their family and their relationships  one of you is likely to cheat on the other happened so much around me in the past few years its sad and that is one or even both spouses cheating whether it gets discovered or not its happening a lot now im not saying that having a happy supportive marriage will mean one of you will never cheat nor am i saying that you can blame an unhappy marriage for your affair if you cheat you made that decision with free will in short i think its much more likely that being in an unhappy marriage creates an environment where one or both of you may cheat  very few people have what it takes to fix a marriage you and your spouse have spent years being unable to communicate and resolve your issues if you have reached the point where you nitpick each other in front of your friends etc i think the marriage is dead and cant be saved this last item is probably the biggest one that someone may be able to change my view on what seems to happen though is that one or maybe even both parties in the marriage is unwilling andor incapable of doing what is necessary to fix a bad marriage one person cant fix a bad marriage it takes two and from what ive seen most people are unable to do what it takes to fix their marriage,1,605,3353,75,0.06666666666666667

cmv a huge number of problems in the united states would be solved if politicians were limited to a single term,i hate politicians primarily at the federal level but at the local level im still not a big fan our world needs order and someone needs to make the rules i hate however that being a politician has become a class all of its own much of the fervor and hate that exists in the country is fed and fueled by people pointing fingers at others and calling them evil republicans are racist vote for me democrats are communists vote for me it all comes to the same point getting as many people behind you so you stay in power instead of the other guy congressmen have held their office for longer than ive been alive im a mom of two with a bachelors degree in that time theyve enriched themselves and their familiesfriends in the millions of dollars talked to people about this before and theyve always said that two or three term limits would be ok i think one would be even better someone is elected they spend so much money trying to convince people to vote for them either by campaigning or posturing in the political arena saying theyre doing so much when in reality nothing happens no more reelection would erase all of that immediately  government is complicated it takes a little while to figure it out giving an extra term or two helps them figure it out i dont agree theres been many a time where important laws get passed quickly if you feel the pressure to get things done before youre replaced youll figure out a way to get things done faster  single term limits would stop the career politician from being a thing you get one term at the local level any position and one term at the federal level any position after that go back to being a dentist or a truck driver or a school teacher manipulation and lying wouldnt be something people get paid for anymore plus people in office would be more in touch with the normal american of your least favorite politiciantrump doesnt count he is a lot of things but he is not a politician how much better would it have been if theyd been released back into normal life years ago or if they had a definite end to their awfulness in a few months itd be a bummer for the very few good ones there are but with more turnover more actual good people would have the chance to make a change good honest people who would be willing to take a break from their lives for a couple of years to make good changes in their communities would really love to be taught some different aspects of this im not an expert of government or politics so i really want to be taught the flaws in my thought process not saying it would be the ultimate best answer but it would fix a lot thanks so much for the people who responded with info instead of just saying people like you are why the world sucks ive given out a few ∆s my view is changed big problem in politics is the corruption if the career field wasnt so insanely lucrative it would resolve the problems more than putting a single term limits the prospect of being reelected would be a bit more incentive to actually do good but keeping lobbying out of the picture would help a lot,1,577,3223,113,0.05309734513274336
cmv there wouldn’t be such a stigma against fatty foods if “fat” the caloric source did not share the same word as the adjective of a person being “fat”,so fats are just another source of calories just like protein and carbohydrates sugars yet fats get a really bad rap because they are associated with being fat yet a person can consume almost no fat in their diet yet still become fat if they consume too many calories from other sources think cows their diet consisted almost exclusively of grass yet they can get quite fat your body processes different types of calories differently protein carbs and fats are all processed by your body a little bit differently but at the end of the day a person becomes fat of they are taking in more calories than they are burning few months back i started the lowcarb keto diet and have actually lost weight while having a diet that consists of far more fatty foods than i used to because again fats are just another form of calories and as long as you are burning more calories than you take in you will lose weight my experience lots of carbohydrates are far more indicative of gaining weight yet there isn’t widespread stigma against carbs my view is that fatty foods have such a stigma because of the association of the noun “fat” with the adjective “fat” people are often far more concerned about a piece of food being high in fat than they are about apiece or food being high in carbs even if the piece of food high in carbs has far more overall calories for example we started calling fats something else like “lipids” there wouldn’t be such a stigma against eating foods containing lipids if the condition of being overweight was called something like being “carby” and having lots of “stored carbs” around your gut there would be a much greater stigma around eating carbs instead of fats my view,1,304,1773,157,0.025477707006369428

cmv resisting arrest should not be allowed as the solo criminal charge,in march of this year police officers in sacramento arrested a man they misidentified as having a warrant out for his arrest the arrest turned physical with an officer kicking the suspect while he was being compliant even though he was later confirmed to not have a warrant the police charged him with a single count of resisting arrest  earlier today a disturbing video was made public that showed an officer from the anderson police using a recently banned chokehold restraint to arrest a man that was only eventually charged with resisting arrest  this as a sole charge is often the byproduct of a police mistake or even an unjustified arrest i believe that the charge is meant to deflect from police misconduct and place the blame on the defendant it does not serve the interest of justice to use resisting arrest as a sole charge especially if the arrest was a case of mistaken identity,1,158,919,71,0.056338028169014086
cmv the delay of merrick garlands scotus nomination for 293 days  while a kavanaugh vote is being pushed for this week  is reason enough to vote against his nomination,i know this post will seem extremely partisan but i honestly need a credible defense of the gops actions  all the things the two parties have done its the hypocrisy on the part of mitch mcconnell and the senate republicans that has made me lose respect for the party i would say the same thing if the roles were reversed and it was the democrats delaying one nomination while shoving their own through the process want to understand how mcconnell and others republicans can justify delaying merrick garlands nomination for almost a year while urging the need for an immediate vote on brett kavanaugh after all garland was a consensus choice a moderate candidate with an impeccable record republicans such as orrin hatch who later refused garland a hearing personally vouched for his character and record it seems the only reason behind denying the nominee a hearing was to oppose obama while holding out for the opportunity to nominate a farright candidate after the 2016 election simply do not understand how mcconnell and his colleagues can justify their actions how can lindsey graham launch into an angry defense of kavanaugh when his party delayed a qualified nominee and left a scotus seat open for months feel like there must be something im missing here after all these are senators  career politicians and statesmen  they must have some credible defense against charges of hypocrisy still it seems to me on the basis of what ive seen that the gop is arguing in bad faith,1,256,1534,171,0.07602339181286549
cmv you arent a strong person if you cant understand or at least acknowledge the importance of vulnerability and being emotional,i have always seen people down play the importance of letting someone know more personal things about yourself i understand being vulnerable takes trust but theres a point when people just have to accept that they can get hurt too i know people in my life who dont say anything about their emotions or feelings and that includes my own dad feels like people want to avoid getting hurt so bad that they cant accept that its ok to reach out to others that getting hurt from others is normal and that you shouldnt avoid being vulnerable entirely but learn to know which people to trust irks me the most is people downplaying the importance of emotions as if those emotions arent part of who they are some may see those types of people as strong to be able to repress their emotions but not me to me you are stronger if you can face those emotions and be able to ask for help when needed,1,166,907,131,0.030534351145038167
cmv just like anorexics are forcibly hospitalized and made to gain weight overweight people should be hospitalized and forced to lose weight,society seems to agree that you can take away an anorexic’s rights if they are too thin and medically unstable  was hospitalized four times for being seriously underweight and i didn’t have a say in the matter i was forced to gain approximately half a pound a day with the consequence of having certain things withheld showers visits phone calls if i didn’t meet that goal and ultimately the threat of a nanogastric tube being shoved up my nose if i consistently failed to gain weight  eating disorder is recognized as an eating disorder yet in each of my hospitalizations there was maybe one or two severely overweight person on the unit and they obviously escaped the consequences related to weight gain  believe that those who are severely overweight due to binge eating disorder are just as at risk for health problems both short and long term as any anorexic and should face the same swift action that i did there should be a medical component that forces them to lose weight at a determined rate with cooccurring therapy to address the underlying issues  they refuse treatment they should be forced into it with signatures from psychiatrists same as an anorexic would be for reasons that they are a danger to themselves  clearly this isn’t happeningso i’d like to believe that there’s a good reason for it so change my view i know the title says “overweight” but i’m specifically talking about overweight folks with a diagnosed underlying mental illness of binge eating disorder some level of physical health problems and an inability or unwillingness to treat their issues on an outpatient basis i’m not advocating for rounding up every overweight person on the planet and sticking them into treatment centers  2 this has been fascinating and so enlightening thank you to everyone who broke things down for me and helped me see the difference between the health risks associated with malnutrition vs obesity i knew i was biased in this situation but i don’t think i realized how much so to anyone suffering from an eating disorder at any size weight or variation of behaviors i wish you healing and true recovery i didn’t think my life could be this good but it’s amazing ,1,382,2260,143,0.027972027972027972

cmv if you are still talking about hillary clinton in 2019 then you dont actually care about the united states,hillary clinton has had zero relevance in terms of any actual policy in this country since she lost her bid for president in 2016 and really not even since she ended her gig as secretary of state in 2013 she hasnt done anything in that span other than write a book tweet a few times and spend time with her family all of which are pretty normal things to do for any american citizen yet i still see people creating fresh slams against hillary new memes about her more rhetoric about how good it is that she didnt win this is years after she stopped being important is only one reason i can think of that explains why anyone still feels like hillary clinton is still relevant that politics is a game where people win and lose and the only thing that matters is that your side wins this mentality is not focused on the country as a whole and i cant possibly imagine why fostering a deep division is really helping anything it highlights that people view politics like they view sports where all they really care about is winning and what you do with that victory is not to use your gained power for good but rather to just gloat about the fact that you won how democrats kept on railing about mitt romney in 2015 two to three years after he lost what you dont well why not i mean he ran for president and lost and i think the majority of americans seem to be glad about that so why is that any different from hillary in 2019 my response is that democrats actually do care about the direction of the country and want to win so that they can change the country for the better and the fact that they left mitt alone after he lost is proof of that the fact that people still care about hillary in 2019 is proof that these people dont actually care about the direction of the country they only care that their side wins elections so they can feel better about themselves why else would hillary still be relevant in 2019 lots of good dialogue here let me respond to some of the common points brought up first the delta i awarded was on this point that she is not relevant i admit now that she is relevant but i still maintain that she is not any more relevant to current politics than any other retired democratic politician i dont take seriously this idea that she may run for office since she said so herself and secondhand conjecture is not going to sway my opinion on that  than anything else it is that she is disproportionately targeted by trolls in comparison to her relevance it doesnt mean anything to me that people might discuss something she said recently its the fact that in the general media sphere ill see more memes  complaints  discussions about hillary than i will about really any other retired politician and in some cases even more than someone who actually holds office right now  the way if people discuss things she said thats fine but when it becomes about her as a person thats when i really scratch my head and wonder what the real goal is there if she says something foolish then one can easily disprove it if you attack her instead then whats that going to accomplish  if she is actually guilty of anything then why havent any republicans with all their current wealth and power managed to get any charges pressed against her i havent seen anyone address this point i did see a super long hearing about benghazi a considerable and protracted effort that tried to achieve this and failed  ought to be more discussion about how i link obsession with hillary to not caring about america and i think the biggest point i want to make there is that hillary clinton is not a priority for this country and yet i see so much shit about her all the time so much discussion so many memes so many insults so many concerns about unfounded conspiracy theories and criminal charges that even the most powerful republicans cant make look i dont even care if youre republican democrat green party supporter libertarian etc i guarantee you that you probably have plenty of actual political priorities in this country like our economy immigration health care the climate research and development foreign relations infrastructure all of these things are so much more important and so vital to our country that i cannot help but think that anyone who actually thinks that hillary is worth talking about in this political climate must clearly not care about any of those things as i cannot otherwise explain how a person can rant and rave about a retired politician but then not have much to say about infrastructure in a country where some bridges just collapse out of the blue i lived 2 blocks from the 35w bridge when it fell and drove on it daily or any other number of major problems take your pick i dare anyone to present an actual concern about hillary clinton that really is a bigger deal than anything i just mentioned ,1,889,5010,114,0.07017543859649122

 don’t really want to discuss how we got here or if it was on purpose i don’t want to entertain illuminati conspiracy bullshit i honestly want someone to help me change my view i’d love to discover this isn’t true but atm i believe it is
 there is more than one type and definition of dystopia here is a good primer

cmv there should be realtime thirdparty factchecking broadcast onscreen for major statements made during nationally broadcast debates,im using the us elections as my context but this doesnt just have to apply in the us in the 2016 election cycle and again now in the 2020 debates a lot of debate time is spent disagreeing over objective statements of fact for example in the october 7 vp debate there were several times where vp pence stated that vp biden plans to raise taxes on all americans and sen harris stated that this is not true my view that the debates will better serve their purpose if the precious time that the candidates have does not have to devolve into thats not trues and no they donts understand that the debates will likely move on before fact checkers can assess individual statements so here is my idea for one possible implementation a quote held onscreen for no more than 30 seconds verified as true false or inconclusive there would also be a tracker by each candidate showing how many claims have been tested and how many have been factual  understand that a lot of debate comes in the interpretations of fact that is not what i mean by factchecking my focus is on binary statements like climate change is influenced by humans and president trump pays millions of dollars in taxes,1,214,1219,140,0.02142857142857143
cmv political debate has been destroyed by strawmanning and echo chambers,i am incredibly disillusioned with the state of political discourse online and irl it seems to me there is very little space for meaningful debate across the leftright divide and it has only gotten worse  1 strawmanning  people cannot have a meaningful debate when they do not understand the other persons position ill choose a nice noncontroversial topic to demonstrate this abortion  prolife opposes abortion because they think it is morally wrong to end a life and that fetuses constitute a life they dont all agree about all the circumstances and they have a variety of arguments for this but at the core that is their position  prochoice side has two distinct stances 1 abortion is not wrong because a fetus is not a lifedoes not trump a womans bodily autonomy or 2 legalized abortion is a lesser evil when compared to the ramifications of making it illegal  course people dont actually argue about these positions  prolife side calls prochoice baby killers accuse them of genocide and eugenics and become susceptible to outrageous claims like abortion being a forprofit industry and fetal tissue ending up in pepsi cola  prochoice side claims that prolifers want to control women want them never to have sex and prefer them dying from back alley abortions to having a safe and legal one  are strawmen which are much easier to argue against than the actual positions  2 social media amplifies extreme views generated enormous traffic for measured and nuances views these views are then found by the other side and used to paint the entire opposition with this seems self explanatory 3 echo chambers and liberalleft thinkers barely interact except to fling insults slogans and misinformation with each other the only places for real discussion are safe spaces typified by subreddits rpolitics for liberals rconservative for cons this is a great way for people to share content and views that confirm their own biases without challenge people on these subs dont see their opponents explain their positions they see them misrepresented by people they already agree with so on the occasions they do interact with people outside the echo chambers they are primed not to listen to a word they say when you bring in discussions of biased media and fake news it gets even worse  a looney leftist who hates cops i dont have to listen to you a racist homophobe i dont have to listen to you dont make this post because im a moderate or centrist or because both sides are equally bad if i did think that itd be a lot easier not to care about this but im concerned if we lose the ability to debate we lose the ability to progress as a society i hope its not too late but i increasingly feel that it is,1,478,2887,74,0.10810810810810811
cmv removing or changing apu in the simpsons isnt constructive to south asian stereotypes,this post stems mainly from the developments around hari kondabolu and his view of apu in essence for those unaware he made a documentary called the problem with apu where he and a bunch of guests talk about their experiences of apu and how it affected them he talks about the fact that apu should be made less of a stereotype and given more character development eg via getting ownership of the kwikemart as well as not having racist undertones eg hank azaria voicing him being replaced by a south asian actor instead also worth pointing out here and now not that it should change anything that im also of south asian ethnicity living in the uk my view is this focusing on the apu problem entirely misses the wider point on racism and stereotypes almost every character on the simpsons is satirical being an exaggerated version of a reallife archetype but we arent having the discussion about the fat tonyluigi problem or the groundskeeper willie problem or the bumblebee man problem the list goes on basically forever so why is that maybe its because those are coming next but im thinking its because to use the fat tonyluigi example other archetypes have representation in a noncaricatured way in popular media or at the least in a more varied way  think the sopranosthe godfather for more gritty representations through to happy days for benign comedy south asians on the other hand have very few when apu first appeared on screens there was virtually no other representation nowadays there are more actors representing eg kal pennaziz ansarimindy kaling even so the characters tend to be either outright plays to the established tropes or in comedy roles its also relatively unusual to see south asian actorsactresses on screen in roles that dont showcase their ethnicity in essence my view is this apu is a caricature on a show full of caricatures the reason we get racist slurs as a minority the standard thank you come again etc is because there is little to no representation outside of comedy as with other ethnicitiespopulations removing apuediting him serves no purpose here and misses the point of the simpsons the way to improve things is to make characters that arent just ethnic props cmv woah this got a lot more attention than i expected thanks so much to everyone for keeping it civil im falling behind on replies but will try and get to you all eventually,1,413,2526,91,0.0989010989010989
cmv being gay is nothing to be proud of because it isnt an achievement pride in being gay is as meaningful as pride in your place of birth gay pride tribalizes the gay community and creates stereotypes against them harming lgbt individuals who do not participate in the pride culture,pretty stoned just thinking about humans when the topic of pride came across my mind i encounter prideful people all the time both in real life and of course the internet pride seems to be considered a virtue and a vice at the same time pride goes beyond selfacceptance it is the assertion of your own identity onto others telling others that youre proud of your child is basking in the glory of what you believe to be good parenting telling others that youre proud of them is being happy that you can associate yourself with an individual that you deem worthy by nature is selfcentered which isnt a bad thing for humans pride is a good incentive for competition and allows us to continue innovating the way we do then i thought what about gay pride why would a gay man be proud to be gay its simply how they were born and raised they had no choice in being gay they just are of course when a person used to say im proud to be gay what they really meant was im proud to be brave because there used to be a huge stigma against gay people fortunately in 2019 gay pride is not as dangerous to those who are openly gay people in san francisco do not need to worry about scrutiny for their annual pride parades which means that at this point theyre merely celebrating their sexuality it doesnt seem to be an issue of pride anymore but an issue of bragging rights essentially saying i am gay and i love to celebrate the fact that i can be gay a new type of pride pride in ones tribe with that in mind i think that it is a meaningless type of pride since being gay isnt an achievement it is as meaningless as being proud to be born as an american or being proud to be born white with each pride parade the pride community also develops stereotypes on the basis that they are the loud minority of gay people not all gay people are proud of being gay they simply are gay and go on with their lives without needing a pride parade as a result gay people have been stereotyped as flamboyant overly promiscuous party animals that do not actually fit the characteristic of every gay person reddit please change my view should gay pride still be a thing in areas where the bravery component is a nonissue if so why should gay pride still be a thing  updated 2018 2019 also semanticsgrammar 2 while i have been convinced that the term pride is not used to describe actual pride but a colloquial sense of belonging and expressing happiness it still seems to me that some people in the comments are trying to convince me why one should be proud i have not yet found a convincing reason for one to be proud of being gay but do agree with the colloquial definition of pride in gay pride to mean happy to be able to be gay umrtouchngo explained this very well bravo being proud of being gay is a self realization overcoming implicit heteronormative values and has less to do with direct interactions with other people people are mean to each other regardless of being gay or straight what i truly admire at this point is the ability to transition from self loathing to self acceptance and i see that this is what gay pride is all about be proud,1,589,3278,290,0.034482758620689655

cmv the fact that minors pay taxes on earned wages and yet cannot vote is unjust and does not follow the spirit of america’s founding,my view is that minors being taxed on earned wages and not given a vote at any level of government is inherently unjust and does not follow the spirit of america’s founding of which “no taxation without representation” was a major factor  do not wish for my view to be misunderstood as that i support minors voting of any age really as a general rule i do not support minors having a vote of any age however i do not believe that you can tax a class of people that have not committed a felony at the same rates as any legal adult and not afford the right of voting to them the post is not about a solution to this it is for my mind to be changed about why the current dynamic is not inherently unjust i would like to clarify what options i believe would be available as it gives a better understanding of my mindset  believe you could afford minors that pay taxes on earned wages or other income types the right to vote i would not be overly enthusiastic about this option but i would suspect the judgement of working teens will on average be at least a bit better  believe you could lower the tax rate for minors or abolish it completely personally i would advocate for the abolishment of taxing working teenagers if they will not be able to vote but i don’t believe there’d ever be an untaxed group of working americans ever so a reduced tax rate for minors seems like a good middle ground  am open and ready to have my mind changed i look forward to the replies,1,283,1503,135,0.037037037037037035
cmv its not worth the effort to argue with religious people about their beliefs,while i dont think it is logical to believe in a religion or a god there are a lot of intelligent and interesting people who are religious arguing with them about their religion or trying to change their mind often leads to nowhere and the person just feels offended that you are critizing a main part of their identity those people are more likely to close up and then you dont get to talk about other important opinions or beliefs they have instead i find it best to just ignore it and assume most peoples intentions are good in almost all cases it doesnt hurt you if someone believes in something you dont i dont really give a shit that people think the earth is flat i might ask them about why they believe that but in the end their mind is set and its just wasted energy trying to argue about it at the end of the day they are still going to be religious and you risk losing an interesting friendthe only exception i can think of is when religion is used to trick or hurt other people like those televangelists worth millions that leech off their followers but that is pretty rare and most religious people are chill,1,211,1139,81,0.04938271604938271

cmv the pro and antipineapple pizza debate is meaningless so long as the real enemy of the people continues to exist big anchovy,back in the 80s and early 90s if you wanted to gross someone out with pizza youd put anchovies on it in theory fish shouldnt be terrible on pizza maybe a nice salmon bake maybe some crab it could work it didnt did big anchovy remove the product from market no the contracts were already in place pizza suppliers already owned the fish so they did their best to use it the contracts ran out though big anchovy wasnt doing so well since pizza places werent ordering any more but whats worse anchovy pizzas been totally demonized and no one no one is buying it anymore last thing big anchovy needs is their respective brands being hated on so they come up with an ingredient that could never work and start marketing it pineapple idea is if big anchovy can get people to hate on pineapple pizza more than anchovy pizza they can distract from all the hate they get and keep out of the negative attention and bide their time for when big anchovy can do a relaunch maybe in a few years problem is for some reason people ended up loving pineapple on pizza now im not here to argue for or against pineapple on pizza i get the idea behind the flavor combinations i get why some may like it and others not and for the purposes of this post im taking a completely neutral stance on it anchovy though is still up to their old games they constantly make posts and memes taking both sides of the argument in the proanti pineapple debate increasing rhetoric and polarization simply for the purpose of misdirecting the hate of the people away from anchovy pizza its working friends have fallen out marriages ended families torn apart and for what so a big anchovy companys stock can increase by a quarter of a point,1,314,1799,131,0.04580152671755725
cmv the antiscience that is rampant today is largely due to people using appeal to authority as an argument and not actually citing studies data and research,in the early to mid 2000s i saw the early stages of the rampant antiscience movement we have today emerging from the likes of alex jones  friend of mine had begun muttering some nonsense about global warming being a hoax and citing studies he took directly off one of alex jones pages so i invited my meteorologist friend to his house for a discussion  during the discussion the meteorologist went through all of the data cited and gave his counterpoints with data  surprisingly he didnt necessarily dismiss all of the denial data but gave his scientific perspective on it at the end he managed to change the deniers perspective and they now not only act consciously in the world but also share the information at their disposal forward to 2014 and my son was about to be born amidst all of the antivaxx hype  my sister in law was very antivaxx and would give my wife and i countless studies to read  i remembering spending many many hours trying to find just one good article actually debunking the antivaxx movement and have very little if any success again i called on a friend to supply data this time my friends sister who is an obgyn again they took out charts and moved systematically through research both debunking and explaining some of the antivaxx points  needless to say my kids are vaccinated but unfortunately most people dont have close and personal access to people they trust that have information like this significant problem is actually getting the real information  everywhere i looked whether it was reddit or articles from the new york times or any publication the argument always ended up at trust science or you are both a moron and an asshole  this sentiment has actually caused my meteorologist friend to step out of his position in the academic world because he thinks people should be encouraged to question everything and then given the data in the best way possible in order to actually proliferate science  his belief and mine now too is that if your argument ever comes down to trust usor them we are experts than you are as anti science as an anti vaxxer,1,376,2147,162,0.024691358024691357
cmv the fact that innocent people have been convicted in the us proves juries need better instruction on what beyond a reasonable doubt means,to date there have been at least 367 wrongfully convicted defendants exonerated as the result of dna evidence and though they spent an average of fifteen years behind bars those are the lucky ones we dont know how many more wrongfully convicted people sit in jail today because there is no funding to pursue their case or there simply is no dna evidence available the fact that any defendants are wrongfully convicted in a system that is supposed to presume innocence and where guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt is my main concern here i take the fact that so many are wrongfully convicted as evidence that juries just do not understand the basic underpinnings of our legal system and need better instructions it should literally be impossible to prove something happened beyond a reasonable doubt if it in fact did not happen you might feel pretty sure that something that didnt happen happened you might believe something that didnt happen probably happened but you should never be in a situation where you believe beyond a reasonable doubt that something that didnt happen happened hundreds of juries apparently came to these conclusions suggests that there are serious problems with how jurors are instructed i think that there are two places where these poor instructions need to be addressed jurors and our legal system in general do not seem willing to take into account how unreliable eye witness accounts are nearly 70 of the wrongful convictions mentioned above involved misleading or misidentified eye witness testimony psychologists have known for a long time that we have bad memories even people who are certain they are telling the truth and in fact are telling the truth as they remember it are in fact incorrect juries need to be made aware of this when they evaluate testimony you shouldnt need to call an expert psychologist in every case this should just be standard jury instruction maybe part of a juror introduction packet if you will also the reliability or unreliability of other kinds of evidence forensic tests etc should be included in instruction to the jury it is insane that many states outright refuse to define what beyond a reasonable doubt means i argue that better instructions should be given to jurors about this phrase in every case where someone is innocent reasonable doubt should exist because the crime literally didnt happen that means the prosecution is relying on circumstantial or eye witness testimony to make their case in every one of these instances it is reasonable to doubt that the person committed the crime it may also be necessary to improve the representation of defendants one could argue that reasonable doubt didnt exist based on the cases presented even with the best instructions if that is the case we need to expand our public defender offices so every defendant gets the kind of defense that can explain just why the prosecutions evidence is doubtful expect that some will come back with well if you took that definition seriously then we would let a lot of guilty people go free i agree i think it is a greater harm to imprison and potentially kill an innocent person than it is to let a guilty person go free presumption of innocence and proof beyond a reasonable doubt is our standard if we take this seriously an innocent person should never ever be convicted the fact that innocent people have been convicted means we need to make one or all of the changes above change my view never expected so many responses  a lot of them are really good but i want to respond to a few of the kinds of responses all at once as i cant get to all of these if we actually adopt this standard well never convict anyone practical implications of juries really understanding when it is reasonable to doubt something are not what im arguing here it may be that if juries really understood this we would never convict anyone if thats the case you could argue we shouldnt use the innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt standard but its not an argument against my original post which is if juries got better instructions we would have no convictions of innocent people having no convictions of any people is actually consistent with this view even if you find such a world objectionable what would you consider beyond a reasonable doubt honest answer is im not sure given what i know about the fallibility of the human memory the legal system and forensic evidence it is actually hard to think of a scenario where there is not a reasonable doubt as to someones guilt that is why i conclude that juries either must not know about these things or they just dont care or they know and care but care more about making sure bad guys go to jail ,1,824,5032,144,0.1597222222222222

cmv a middle class person is better off living in a small eu country than in us,this is not really us bashing it is actually related to a personal choice and by explaining my thought process i think i am able to represent an average person here dont get me wrong my ego is big and i dont think of my self as average in most cases but in terms of lifestyle and class i certainly think i am i also dont want to discuss trump at all i recently had a debate with someone who still thinks us provides the most to people who live in it so i want to see what can us give me that would make me want to live there instead of my very unimpressive country am croatian our country had a war is now in eu our politicians are generally incompetent we are no economic force our salaries are not impressive i find it beautiful but i also find us beautiful and i wont be discussing emotional reasons to live in either place here just saying im not from scandinavia or germany to rightfully brag about doing things better than the us but most european countries even those not in eu share certain privileges  am university educated with a masters at the moment it didnt cost me anything and i have work experience in one unrelated but very solid field however while this maybe puts me a bit above average i am not an entrepreneur like most people arent and have no interest or ability to run my own business i also dont need to make tons of money i of course appreciate a good salary and want to be able to live a sustainable self reliant comfortable and safe lifestyle  but for me that means  owning an apartmentplace to live not having debt having retirement savings being protected in cases of sickness or medical emergencies being able to pay bills go out take courses in something that interests me travel affordably have ikea furniture and wear hm nothing extravagant because i realistically dont need it and it doesnt motivate me  also care about work life balance a lot i want to have free time for myself for my interests for people i dont want my job dominating my life most people dont we need time off we need vacations i fear that if i go to us i will lose generous vacation time and work will be much more intense i would probably not have a month off or more every year and limitless sick days i will make more money but everything will be more expensive and i will desperately depend on my job for medical insurance so if i quit or lose my job for a short while i cant get sick  id rather be unemployed somewhere where it doesnt threaten my livelihood than working somewhere where i cant afford to quit  brings me to medical insurance i do understand that while us doesnt have a free health care you are often insured through work but many are not i saw tons of people on reddit explain how much they got into debt because of an accident that involved emergency so not like they had a choice not to go  it also seems that your insurance plan might not cover many things if youre not rich which leads to so many movie and show plots where characters have to do something crazy to afford healthcare for themselves or loved one i hear the argument about being able to choose your doctors but none of it makes sense to me what do i need to choose for if i am sick the only thing i want is that i am helped and cured and that i dont have to worry about money during that people still have private providers if they want to pay for some additional comforts  but even those private providers arent that expensive in comparison because they still have to make sense to people who are getting it for free  i dont want kids which saves me a lot of problems but the majority of people do so lets also explore what that would mean if i wanted to have a kid in my shitty country i would not need to be rich my medical expenses would be covered kindergardens are cheap or even free i will mention but not focus on the cultural element too where most of us get tremendous help from our families allowing people more free time but to an extent that is not a guarantee for all i head that childcare in us is so expensive that often one parent has to stop working because they simply cant manage it so in the country where without money youre nothing one person has to lose their job and the other has to better not end up losing it no matter how bad it gets  wed have t think about school public schools in my country and a lot of europe are better than private schools and poor kids and rich kids attend them together usually when rich kids go to a private school its because they werent good students in a public school so the equal opportunity is literally there i wouldnt have to save ridiculous sums id much rather have in my own savings for college because a kid will go into college by merit and if i do need to put my kid in a private college because they were bad academically and i dont want them to do a trade school which btw lead to very good employment opportunities and should not be dismissed it wont be expensive because again its competing with free stuff  will now say that at least their higher education is the best in world ok i think our free universities are very good too but objectively yes expensive private universities can afford state of the art facilities and renowned professionals who come and teach but the class plays such a huge role in where someone will end up there are some scholarships to keep up the appearance but from what i understand many of the us public schools are very poor quality or the quality ones require you to live in a certain limited location while rich kids get prepared from early on a good public school student who maybe wont get a special scholarship because they arent extraordinary in sport what does that have to do with anything or in any other way that will get huge attention will be worse off than a bad private school student because in the end while merit might help a small minority money will help everyone to get their place even if theyre not academically gifted at all it seems to me that these amazing colleges just serve to give credibility to the already rich who will go on being rich anyway so that they can pretend that theyre actually smart cause they went to harvard and maintain the illusion that even the poormiddle class can do it if they work hard enough  final point i know the least about is property in my country most of us own property  poor middle class upper middle class all have some property they inherited or are able to buy apartments for their kids during the socialist time many people were given property  my grandpa used his completely average middle class yugoslavia salary to buy each of his kids an apartment a big house on the seaside etc i understand that maybe this was an extraordinary situation and market isnt like that but i also dont understand why americans need huge houses and cars and debt either maybe this is more lifestyle issue than something that belongs here but the debt part  i understand you are forced to use a credit card in america or else you dont get access to housing loans so a person who doesnt buy into the whole consumerism and wants to save money is actually penalized the one time they need to loan to buy property and stop renting  will point out that none of these things are free and we all pay more taxes sure but again for an average persons average salary with the taxes deducted from it we get healthcare education retirement care in cases of emergencies and good social programmes as a support through hard times if your goal is to be an entrepreneur get filthy rich and dont want too many limitations or taxes because you dont have to give a shit maybe us is the place for you  most people including smart and educated people want a good life they want balance they want to be safe they want their family to be taken care of they want the freedom to quit a bad job or get sick without going bankrupt they want time to themselves and people in their lives i just dont see how the us provides that i dont think us is a good place for most people to live in because it forces you to have to be rich to have a decent life i dont really see what id get as an averagemiddle class person in the us and think life for that group is better in almost any european country including small economically weaker ones i dont think pursuit of money is really a choice in that context and i dont think its a great way to live a life,1,1597,8655,80,0.1

cmv the best way to fix the injustice in us court systems is to make the victim and the accused person anonymous to the judge and jury,"cmv people say justice is blind but for some people that doesn’t seem to be the case discrimination based on appearance and gender can often distort justice and harm the nation as a whole
as such the best way to combat this discrimination is to not let the judge know anything about these people other than the crimes they may or may not have committed and the evidence for and against it the judge should not know the appearance gender or any other physical trait except for injuries relevant to the crime of course they would still have access to criminal records but those should also have names and photos redacted for the purpose of judging them in a new trial 
as such a new anonymous form of justice would be the best way of determining how our society gets justice for its victims and it’s falsely accused",1,147,827,136,0.014705882352941176
cmv selectively breeding animals with genetic defects should be illegal,"this post is prompted by this one which shows a baby albino turtle born with an open heart cavity turns out it is the product of extensive selective albino inbreeding by these assholes  is heavily correlated with birth defects health issues and drastically shorter lifespans i see no reason why this should be legal and i think this should extend to the breeding of dogs that have respiratory and other issues because we think they’re cute creating new breeds and varieties of animals that are born to suffer edit per uitsaworkalt purely for profitvanity and not for medical research etc is pure animal abuse

cmv news coverage is now so poor that following the news will actually make you less informed about reality than ignoring it,"in the last year ive found myself very reluctantly coming to the conclusion that there is no longer any point whatsoever in attempting to stay informed by watching reading or listening to any mainstream news sources no matter its position on the political spectrum   occasional examples of good journalism or rare investigative articles can be found from nearly any source i believe that any relevant information you can learn from these rare cases is massively outweighed by the sheer quantity of misinformation and propaganda that you are exposed to in discovering them  my core points are the following the introduction of social media and clickdriven internet traffic have created a perverse environment where good journalism is punished and bad journalism heavily rewarded  
 the increased competition and pressure on the media from the above has resulted in the downsizing of traditional news rooms  unfortunately the first positions to be lost were specialist technical and expert positions meaning most journalists are no longer knowledgeable on the fields they are assigned to report on
 governments and politicians have learned increasingly effective methods of propaganda in the last decade which news sources either have no interest in counteracting or no ability to counteract  the truth is now indistinguishable from lies
 even if somehow you manage to spend enough time and energy extracting the truth from the lies you will be shouted over by the many more people who believe the lie and believe it firmly  politics has become so polarized that the truth is irrelevant the brief summary  to clarify in more depth the reasons why i believe the above internet is a perverse environment is the best example of the perverse incentives created by the way news media is now funded  it appears abundantly clear to me that the media will report stories and articles they know to be misleading or downright false simply because they know they generate outrage and traffic  this has always been true to some extent or another throughout history newspapers have been making money from peddling outrage  however until recent years there was a genuine effort by respectable news sources not to lower themselves to this kind of coverage  i can no longer find any news sources which still seem to make this effort  the economics of the internet mean that news sources can no longer survive at all without publishing false stories and clickbait in an effort to drive traffic to their website is dead part and parcel of the contraction of the media all news companies have been forced to downsize and the first places to suffer staffing and budget cuts have been the least profitable and more niche departments  media companies are no longer willing to pay high salaries to journalists with strong expertise in specific areas  this is a longer term trend which has been happening for decades even before the internet completely eclipsed paper journalism the cumulative effect of it over time is that nearly every news article is produced by someone with no specialist knowledge or experience whatsoever  errors and complete ignorance of an articles topic are commonplace and chances are any article you read on a technical topic is either lifted wholesale from a press release or published by someone with no further knowledge or understanding than any random member of the public is such a broad topic and with so much written on it that i dont feel that i have the space to go into it here  for the sake of simplicity ill stick to one propaganda strategy by way of an example believe that the firehose of falsehood has become an incredibly widespread tool within politics both national and international  i also believe that there has been a complete and utter failure by the media to counteract it and it may be completely impossible for any media source to counteract this strategy   proliferation of this propaganda strategy is one of the key reasons i believe that it is not worth trying to stay informed any more  the more you expose yourself to journalism as it currently stands the more vulnerable you are to manipulation using this strategy are poor at separating a convenient lie from an inconvenient truth at the best of times  we are exceptionally good at choosing to believe what we would prefer to believe rather than what the evidence shows to be true  this has been true since the dawn of time but the increased polarization arising from the internet driving us into bubbles has destroyed the only countermeasure to this  regular exposure to people we disagree with  the effect of this is that even if i somehow manage to discover the truth behind the falsehoods its a useless truth  it cant be spread to anyone other than the people who are already inclined to believe it because the majority of people now openly reject even objective facts which contradict their political position also add that on this point i wont be convinced by the what if everyone thought that way argument as i have no control what other people think  to quote catch 22

 but yossarian suppose everyone felt that way  
then said yossarian id certainly be a damned fool to feel any other way wouldnt i”      can elaborate on these views further if need be  on a personal level i myself was always someone who tried very hard to recognize the truth behind media sources despite the problems with journalism and reporting that have always existed  my previous belief was that even if falsehoods were widespread it was possible to slowly change peoples minds as long as you have a good understanding of the facts and could give people information without being judgmental or overly zealous   only fairly recently that ive come to the depressing conclusion that its now futile to try this and its better to completely give up on trying to cut through the wall of bullshit produced by the media  the only hope i currently hold for this is that as older generations who are unfamiliar with the internet die off newer generations will be much more prepared for and capable of adjusting their thinking to avoid being mislead by false information  however this is only a hope and i can see no evidence that younger generations are less prone to being mislead than older generations",1,1096,6618,126,0.031746031746031744
cmv the nba should not support the black lives matter movement while censoring other important social justice issues like the hong kong democracy protests,"first off i want to say that i do support the black community and i do think that athletes should use their platform to promote social justice in their community however when daryl morey the general manager of the houston rockets tweeted out an image that voiced support for protests in hong kong the nba publicly apologised to china calling the image regrettable the nba has censored players support for the pro democracy protests concerned that the loss of chinese viewers sponsors and leagues would impact revenue recently the nba released a list of preapproved political messages including ‘i can’t breathe’ ‘black lives matter’ etc these are important social justice statements however it is wrong that they will not allow players to support any other social justice issue issues like the hong kong democracy protests where is the line drawn the nba needs to either allow their players to make social justice statements without being censored or they should not allow social justice statements at all  thanks for everyones responses id encourage you to keep on discussing this there is some really great dialogue in the comments section thats worth a read am still frustrated that the nba is capitalising on social justice and the idea of standing for something even if it costs everything however as a few have pointed out the nba is a organisation that wants to make money and they are within their rights to prioritise issues that will benefit them financially will go through and award deltas to the posts that made me reconsider my original statement have changed my view on the following points i agree that it is better that the nba support one social issue than none at all
2 i agree that since the nba is not an entity that has moral obligations they do not have a duty to prioritise social justice they have the right to support social justice issues that will make them money really value a lot of your contributions it made my day to see so many aware of the financial motivations of woke institutions that want to portray themselves as champions of human rights its not just the nba that are doing this just look at the apples morning show as ricky gervais said at the golden globes its  a superb drama about the importance of dignity and doing the right thing made by a company that runs sweatshops in china reading from other redditors that see through the portrayed image of these corporations has restored a little bit of my faith in the general public but maybe its just the people in this community that have their thinking hats on thankyou everyone",1,449,2683,156,0.057692307692307696

cmv men and women who make false rape claims should be forced to register as sex offenders,"before i begin my argument id like to establish this first when i say false rape claims i do not mean cases like rapist brock turners case where its a safe assumption based on the evidence that they committed the crime yet somehow get away with it i am not trying to dissuade actual victims if you are a victim seek legal action if you havent already mean cases where evidence of the claim is either completely unfounded andor falsified or it is later found out that the claims made against the accused where false cases such as
 belle who within the space of four years beale claimed she had been seriously sexually assaulted by six men and raped by nine all strangers in four different attacks from one of the men she accused farmer a rape on campus rolling stone article by sabrina erdely where a gang rape claim against the local chapter of the phi kappa psi fraternity im a member at another chapter so i personal stake with this one claim against aziz ansari no presses charged but you can see the effect it had on his life
 could go on but ill stop there in most of these cases the false accuser was punished to some capacity however its not enough making false claims of rape is just as destructive as committing the act where a victim of actual sexual violence might experience both physical and psychological trauma that effects their daily life andor may face backlash in their socialite in one way or another the victim of a false accusation faces something similar nature they are blackballed from society and socially ostracized for actions they did not commit even if justice comes their way the damage is already done and you can never truly get rid of that brand it also makes finding justice for actual victims much harder much like how the abuse of a medicine like adderall opioids etc makes it harder by placing more scrutiny on people that would actually benefit from it the same can be said about false rape claims why make them register as sex offenders well thats fairly simple if an individual is willing enough to construct a falsified claim as a way to deface andor imprison an innocent man or woman then they clearly not meant to be trusted by society their workplace current or future and anywhere else they could easily inflict damage on more innocent people what do you think do you disagree am i being too harsh or not harsh enough im interested in hearing what you have to say my mind as they say
 formatting ill get to as many of your responses as possible fact checking the counter arguments both yours and mine edit a lot of you are asking how would you go about finding if the claim was false i did some digging and here is a journal of psychology that proposes a way to discern fact from truth they state we propose a new theory based on the literature the theory of fabricated rape the theory of fabricated rape predicts that differences between the story of a false complainant and a true victim will arise because a false complainant has to fabricate an event that was not experienced and a true victim can rely on recollections of the event on the one hand the false complainant is lying and will behave as liars do on the other hand she is constructing a story based on her own experiences and her beliefs concerning rape if the experiences do not resemble rape and the beliefs concerning rape are not valid detectable differences between a true story of rape and a false story of rape a fabricated rape will arise the current study will test the validity of a list of differing characteristics between false and true allegations constructed based on the suggested theory of fabricated rape to the journal found a way to deal with it on a case by case basis here however i think we could still talk long term punishment this is a footnote from the cmv moderators wed like to remind you of a couple of things firstly please read through our rules if you see a comment that has broken one it is more effective to report it than downvote it speaking of which downvotes dont change views any questions or concerns feel free to message us happy cmving",1,743,5118,92,0.043478260869565216

 we have taken adequate measures and might have prevented such abuse from strangers by teaching children common practises such as stranger danger ive not been able to find evidence of children being educated on how the close circle of family and friends may be more likely to house such nefarious individuals parents feel that it might cause their children to distrust every family member they meet or they dont want to create an atmosphere of fear at every christmas party but that doesnt alter the fact that creating a fanciful environment for a child makes him more vulnerable to the machinations of a proximate predator wonder if teaching stories from the grimm fairy tales might have actually not been a bad idea in the middle ages when children were highly prone to being exploited granted theyve an excessive level of violence and gore likely since adults arent sure how to ensure that children grasp the seriousness of certain situations certainly a partially diluted version or an interactive version of the same could be used to teach children the possible dangers of sexual abuse from trusted individuals have forgotten their childhood memories and need to relearn how it is to be a child and grow up everyday a better understanding of their child may allow parents to better communicate such dangers without scarring or depressing them read not advocating to scare children in to distrusting everyone however sitting idly by is definitely just as bad my view is that we need a method that is as mainstream like stranger danger where we can progressively teach them some form of elementary critical thinking as they age dont need to be taught to be scared of everyone rather as they grow up they need to be taught how to identify such problematic situations what they may experience and the options available to them  child sexual abuse comes from close quarters such as family and friends
 children need to be taught the mainstream equivalent of stranger danger with respect to family and other known individuals
 a version of grimm fairy tales with stories illustrating such predators the tactics they might use and how to escape them would be helpful

2 248 of the participants were oversampled from places with 70 population of black hispanic or lowincome households  
as many commenters pointed out a good community significantly reduces the chance of such abuse being perpetrated
3 any survey that requires finding respondents at home and obtaining cooperation
runs the risk of missing those members of the population who may be
most vulnerable to victimization
4 the study was conducted in the last decade as some commenters pointed out and the study agrees with them there has been a signifcant drop in the level of sexual abuse from pre1990 levels
5 although the sample size of roughly 45k respondents is large enough its only a representation of the population as in any other study for major edit

cmv the way math education is currently structured is boring ineffective and stifles enjoyment of the subject math education should be reworked to be inquiry and problem based not rote memorization,"i have two main premises here modern math education at the elementary and high school level stifles everything enjoyable about math and it does so to no end
2 an inquirybased approach is at least equally effective and possibly more effective for this purpose im using inquirybased to mean that a significant portion of the learning is driven by students solving problems and exploring concepts before being instructed in those concepts as it is taught in schools right now barely resembles math everything is rote memorization with no focus on creativity exploration pattern recognition or asking insightful questions students are shown how to do a problem and then repeat that problem a hundred times you havent learned anything there  youre repeating what someone else showed you many students find school math incredibly boring and i think its because of this problem kids are naturally curious and love puzzles and if you present them with something engaging and fun theyll jump into it a lot of the hatred of math comes from having to memorize one specific way to solve a problem its such a common phenomenon that there are memes about math teachers getting angry when you solve a problem with a different method the argument that oh we need to teach fundamentals but fundamentals dont take a decade to teach and they should be integrated with puzzles and problem solving kids need to learn basic number sense in the same way they need to learn the alphabet but once they have that they should be allowed to explore kids in english class arent asked to memorize increasingly complex stories and kids in math class shouldnt be asked to memorize increasingly complex formulae currently a math major in university and one of the first courses i took was titled intro to algebra the second half of the course was number theory but a great deal of the learning was from assignments assignment questions were almost always framed as do this computation do you notice a pattern can you prove it can you generalize it do you have any conjectures no single right answer there and that makes it interesting you get to be creative you get to explore you get to have fun the questions were about a whole lot of number theory questions and i know more number theory now than if someone had just sat at a blackboard and presented theorems and proofs everyone in that class learned by doing and exploring and conjecturing of people who reviewed the class enjoyed it  students dont use the facts they learn in high school they do however use the soft skills there are millions of adults who can recite the quadratic formula to absolutely no avail  if these people instead learned general logical thinking and creative problem solving it would be far better for them in an inquiry based system is slower but it helps you develop stronger mathematical maturity so you can pick up new concepts for other subjects  say calculus for engineering or physics  more quickly students develop more valuable soft skills have way more fun and get a better picture of what math is actually like as such i believe that inquiry based learning is superior cmv there are a lot of comments and a lot of great discussions im still reading every new comment but i wont reply unless theres something i have to add that i havent said elsewhere because the volume of comments in this thread is enormous thank you everyone for the insightful replies",1,595,3651,202,0.024752475247524754

cmv the minimum wage should be directly attached to housing costs with low consideration of other factors,"minimum wage is intended to be the lowest wage one can exist on without going into debt trying to buy groceries and toilet paper at the same time the united states is way too big and way too varied in economic structure for a flat national minimum to make sense so 15 nationally will not work however we cant trust the local corporate and legal structures to come up with wage laws that make sense for their area without some national guidelines you break down the cost of living the biggest necessary expense for a single adult is going to be housing usually by a very wide margin landlords have a financial incentive to make this cost go up as much and as often as possible duh and no incentive to make housing affordable and accessible because its a necessity thats extremely hard to go without you need housing in order to not die of exposure this makes it easy for landlords and property managers to behave in predatory ways toward their tenants for example raising the cost of housing on lease renewal by exactly the margin that the company their tenant works for has increased their pay the landlord doing no additional labor is now getting that workers raise commonly agreed that 40 hours is a standard work week using that number as our base but acknowledging that most companies paying minimum wage are not interested in giving their workers the opportunity to approach overtime i think its reasonable to say that the average part time worker can be expected to get around 20 hours believe that the minimum wage should be equivalent to the after tax takehome pay that is needed to pay rent for safe singleperson suitable housing within reasonable transit distance from the job and that this amount of money should be earned in under 60 hours per month 15week this ensures that local business will pressure landlords to keep housing near their businesses affordable so
2 the cost of housing will trend toward slightly above the cost of maintaining that housing which deincentivizes profiting off of owning something you arent using making the cost of purchasing a home and settling in early adulthood well within the realm of possibility for your average family

4 anyone who holds any job will be able to afford safe shelter for at least long enough to find a better job or get some education which will increase stability and reduce the homeless population using the market instead of using public services as band aids do acknowledge that there are some issues inherent in this for example walmart purchasing a building and turning it into 1250month studio apartments in order to retain a low labor value in the area or the implications in how this impacts military pay but the idea here is to specifically plan for regional nuance so doing this would also involve preventing large corporate entities from buying apartment buildings believed this for a long while but i also do not feel that i know enough about politics or economics to have a reliable understanding of many facets of the situation and i look forward to discussing it so i can adjust this view accordingly you start a conversation ive had 12 times already im just ignoring the message sorry someone asked for specific examples of what rent prices would result in what wages so a standard expected price for a two bedroom apartment is 1200 pay should be around 10 net pay so probably closer to 12 gross because accommodation for one person costs 600 a month which can be earned in 60 hours at that rate im going to bed soon have work in the morning",1,637,3765,107,0.037383177570093455
cmv society has moved away from “doing good” as a way to convey morality to “condemning bad”,i apologize if the title is a bit confusing  i think in our current society in the us at least we have fallen into a pattern of becoming hyper focused on the bad things that people do and then use this outrage as a basis for which to feel good about ourselves while condemning the bad things people do isn’t necessarily a negative on its own it seems to have become an insidious force in our culture  people are beginning to substitute doing actual good things like helping bring kind and generosity with a false sense of moral superiority because they can rationalize complacency with “well at least i’m not  a naziracistbigoted or whatever want people to understand that what i’m talking about isn’t an attack on “virtue signaling” or any other political style rhetoric although the current political situation has increased the frequency of people doing this it’s more of a commentary on a wider societal problem that is extremely detrimental to people overall  perhaps one of the places this is most prevalent is actually on reddit itself  the front page is always filled with posts from subs like rmaliciouscomploance rpettyrevenge rtalesfrom ridontworkherelady all which tell stories of redditors “getting back” at people who did bad things and everyone kind of jerks themselves off to how self righteous they are   first started noticing this problem around 2012 and it continues to get worse every year  it seems like people have moved away from doing things that are cool pure and awesome in a way that brings people together and instead seem to be content to bask in a holier than thou attitude because they aren’t a member of the kkk anyone change this view for me  i need my faith in humanity to be restored this is a footnote from the cmv moderators wed like to remind you of a couple of things firstly please read through our rules if you see a comment that has broken one it is more effective to report it than downvote it speaking of which downvotes dont change views any questions or concerns feel free to message us happy cmving,1,366,2344,94,0.1276595744680851
cmv the amazon rainforest is too integral to the health of the planet for one nation to be guardian the amazon should be entrusted to a global guardianship a combo of high level forest management and military protection to ensure its persistence and health,edit to add i misspoke earlier when writing the subject line here is how it should read cmv the amazon rainforest is too  integral to the health of the planet for individual nations to be guardian the  amazon should be entrusted to a global guardianship a combo of high  level forest management and military protection to ensure its  persistence and health think it is well established that the amazon rainforest is integral to the health of the planet as a carbon graveyard and heat sink home to stunning biodiversity and cultural heritage its loss would have unimaginably harmful global impacts survival is our survival and a multinational coalition should step up to protect it and take guardianship hopefully with cooperation of government the idea being the execution of economic sanctions and threat of military force from several powerful nations would sway even someone like bolsinaro to cave i think this works best spearheaded by the us but would need purchase from several other major military and economic powers to add i want to clarify that i am generally 100 antiwar andor military intervention in fact part of the reason i am putting this up for discussion is that i am not fully sure about it and i do not like that as far as i can see this might be a rare situation where military force might be required i am also anticolonial antiracists and prodemocracy thanks to everyone who contributed patrickkelly2012 had the biggest impact on my thinking seems that the amazon is not as integral as i thought i still think it is worth preserving at all costs but see how military intervention would counterproductive my hope is that an international movement coalesces to and uses all nonviolent means to protect all of the earths biosphere especially the ocean and the oldest forests,1,309,2089,261,0.02681992337164751
cmv fines should be based on the percentage of the offenders total wealth not a set amount of money,"several countries including switzerland already do this  are meant to be a punishmentdeterrent that isn’t quite as harsh as prison time that said there are rich fucks here in north america that couldn’t care less about their drunken spoiled kid’s behaviour or their own because the fines are so insignificant  top of that many rich people from europe and other parts of the world aren’t even aware of the stigma of paying a fine they literally see it as “it costs 30 to litter” “it costs 200 to go over the speed limit” etc they’re technically right but the fact that they view it that way should be a red flag that using a set amount of money as a deterrent doesn’t work on some people is universal yet the effect of a trustfund billionaire paying a 200 fine vs someone with only 500 of savings being charged with the same is vastly different but it’s far more equal when the punishment for a small offence for both of these fellows is having to pay 5 of their total net worth  is a number i pulled out of my ass as long as it’s an equal percentage for everyone and not a draconian enough percentage to make jail time preferable lawmakers could agree on a reasonable amount as long as it’s equal for everyone side note i remembered when writing this for corporations and politicians the fines should be even more damaging  get hit with fines that aren’t even based on how much they profited from the illegal activity like the degenerate pieceofshit family the sacklers who own the company purdue pharma that debatably started the american opioid crisis and canada’s by extension 
these people conducted the nflbig tobaccostyle propaganda campaign of “our product isn’t that bad” paying off corrupt doctors and spokespeople to downplay how addictive opioids are and years later when it was too late purdue pharma was fined 600 million a whopper right by this time purdue pharma had raked in 31 billion dollars that fine was a drop in the bucket their bank accounts should have been gutted for what they did this wasn’t a deterrent to other predatory corporate titans from trying something like this if anything it was a public demonstration that anything is allowed as long as your illegal activities make more profit than the expense of paying the fine have at it the fine is nothing more than an expense you have to factor into your business plan  to what i said about the fines for individuals “not a draconian enough percentage to make jail time preferable” i stand by this but it should be the opposite for major political and corporate fines if you’re going to abuse that amount of power the fines should be based on of the money you made from the illegal activities  90 of your remaining net worth after that fine  can count the first and second section as separate change my view 1 a lot of people ask what would become of someone in debt or with no money we would pay them just kidding the solution to this is basing the fine on a percentage of net worth but introducing a baseline amount that the fine cannot go any lower than we could keep the cost  of the fines now as the level that the fines cannot go any lower than 2 “net worth” in this context is the amount of cash the offender has plus everything they own or own part of that can be converted into cash 3 i’m going to stop arguing for and against a broke person paying a baseline amount of money or not it’s great to hear different points of view from people but the comments are torn about 5050 between “a single mom shouldn’t have to worry about paying the next bill due to a baseline fine if you only have 200 losing 10 is a big hit” which i should note is the effect of the system we have now and “if someone has no or almost no money the system would allow them to do whatever they wanted and they would be free of consequences” which is a good argument for a baseline amount of money the fine costs i’ve heard both sides i won’t be fully siding with either  4 no this does not punish people for being frugal and smart with their money if you and your neighbour both have to pay a ticket you have 100000 that you have in your car your house and your kids college and you have some cash leftover and your irresponsible neighbour “blew 100000 on a stupid boat” and has no cash you will still be fined equally 
the boat would not be accounted for as a boat it would be considered 100000 in the form of a boat  to edit 2 “net worth” in this context is the amount of cash the offender has plus everything they own or own part of that can be converted into cash guessed it if your ‘financially irresponsible’ neighbour has to sell his boat to pay the fine and have the extra cash left over that’s his problem not yours i’ll edit edit 4 to include this a lot of people are asking  used the boat as an example precisely because it’s something that retains value if your neighbour spent all his money on things that don’t retain value like food vacations and hookers —things that are briefly consumed and are then gone— was the neighbour unwise with his money sure let’s say he was but since he spent all that money on things that didn’t retain value that chunk of his net worth is simply gone he is now at a lower networth than you are and will still be fined accordingly  5 jesus christ no this punishment is not the same as “sentencing a 20year old to twenty  years in jail vs 70year old to only one year in jail for the same crime because “they have more time left” nor do i think this is equivalent to raising all crimes to be punishable by death you can’t buy more time and i think the commenters suggesting everyone be sentenced to equal times of community service have a great point 5h lost to a tech titan is 5h lost to a homeless person whether or not they could have used this time to be productive to society is irrelevant just take it out of their free time einstein",1,1103,6132,102,0.0392156862745098

cmv arrest records should not be made public only conviction records should be,i was reading my local newspaper last night and every week the police department puts out a record of arrests made in the county were not a large county so its not uncommon to know someone who is featured or at least know someone in their familysame last name obviously not everyone who is arrested is guilty if theyre found not guilty and the crime was minor and most are that wont make the paper  but their arrest already has and given that most newspapers are published online nowadays their names will come up in search engines as having been arrested but youd have to search the state court record system to find out they werent convicted which is much harder to do  should not be convicted in the court of public opinion before they are convicted in an actual court its not the publics business who gets arrested its the publics business who is found guilty of a crime my view,1,164,935,80,0.05
cmv 2020 will be known in history as the crucial turning point at which china became ‘the new boss’,"eta view changed  people here have convinced me that 
1 economically speaking china might need the developed world more than the other way around they are the number one manufacturer in the world but their economy is likely not robust andor diversified enough to adapt ifwhen their labor costs rise and their customers start to move manufacturing elsewhere 
2 the ccp is probably lying about the number of infections in china even now which in the face of global disaster would make them very much the opposite of the responsible world leader i thought they might be trying to positionportray themselves as 
3 any good guy action on their part or even the attempts at it which frequently seem to go wrong is likely more motivated by the need to produce propaganda for their own population than by a genuine desire to help the rest of the world out  number 2 in particular has driven a nail through the heart of my premise  apologize to the people whose long thoughtful and detailed posts i wasnt able to respond to regardless of whether i responded or not ive read everything and i genuinely want to thank all of you for your contributions we are witnessing right now is the changing of the guard  china is already a power nobody else can live without by manufacturing output it is the world leader even american companies known for innovation notably silicon valley giants like apple are lost without chinese laborers assembling their products but not just them  has effectively colonized the most valuable parts of africa not with boots on the ground as europeans once did but with huge financial and infrastructure investments he who pays the piper calls the tune  and europeans are losing faith in the democratic model by the millions populist rhetoric is winning increasingly strong if perhaps totalitarian leadership is seen not just as acceptable but maybe even the only really effective option we have even by the current us president people not just in the us but in various european nations as well are refusing to even exercise their democratic right to vote because they think it’s pointless newer eu member states are deeply disappointed with a real or perceived failure of the eu to make any kind of positive difference in their citizens’ lives and the more established ones are either considering going it on their own again in order to focus on their own not necessary democratic alternative narratives or they are actively blocking further european integration which would be necessary for the union to tackle big current and future events including but not limited to an unlikely but in the event that it were to happen surely devastating war with the chinese russia which at least pretended to strive for democracy for a couple of decades following the cold war recently passed a series of constitutional amendments aimed at enabling putin and whoever comes after him to rule for life  now the final nail in the coffin the chinese are winning hearts and minds by sending face masks ventilators and medical personnel all around the world  has promised his military power will rival that of the americans by 2035 but i don’t think it will even matter america is not going to war with the chinese the economic price to pay would be too high not to mention if the issue were forced then given their superior numbers and unrivaled manufacturing capacity the chinese may well win that war if it started tomorrow don’t particularly look forward to living in a totalitarian world order so change my view",1,611,3676,101,0.039603960396039604
cmv children enrolled in k12 schools should have free lunch regardless of ability to pay or qualify for free lunch program,according to maslow’s hierarchy of needs basic needs such as shelter and food must be obtained in order for an individual to progress higher through the pyramid children who are sated have a better ability to focus on their learning instead of on where their next meal is coming from the meals provided at school might be the only meal the child knows they are getting that day i think establishing a school as a “safe space” for children will give them a better chance for success opponents of this idea may suggest that the financial cost is simply too much of a burden for the government or the individual school district to bear however programs could be implemented to ensure the lowest cost even though the cost would never be able to be eliminated any expense gained could be argued that the value to the student would be immeasurable in terms of the value of their life over time some other considerations to consider for this issue could be some of the logistics while handling children with allergies or children who have picky tastes you wouldn’t want to provide them with a food that they would not eat and then just throw away – however i think this would be a small challenge to overcome and would ultimately improve children’s food security in america,1,225,1287,125,0.04
cmv colleges in the us only care about profits and protecting profit generators in the middle of a pandemic,okay so as im sure other sports fans have noticed the ncaa has suspended all fall championships outside of division 1 and the big ten has officially opted out of the 2020 fall sports season  basically universities are recognizing that travel and the inevitable proximity to one another is unsafe and unpredictable  so to protect athletes that make them millions they are preventing competition  this is completely reasonable and is best practice for navigating the dangers to the health of studentathletes   they seem to take no issue with bringing in students from all across the country and in some cases different countries to live in highly close proximity on campus and go to massive lecture halls  why  as some economists have noted many universities without huge endowments may go bankrupt without tuition and room and board expenses being maintained by students  so they value their profit generators studentathletes and want to protect them but health and safety is out the window if that means losing out on room and board which would occur if the fall semester was declared online only and tuition many students refuse to pay the same price for an online tuition and are opting to take gap years if this is the case    certainly a financially tough situation for many schools but should maintaining revenue truly be the driving force behind holding classes in person when big univeristies are signaling that they fully understand how unsafe travelling and being in close contact with people is at this point in the us  further by making this choice to have classes held in person i believe the vast majority of universities have zero actual regard for the health and wellbeing of their students if it hurts their pockets  change my view,1,306,1798,110,0.05454545454545454
cmv the 40 hour work week is an outdated concept and needs to be lowered to 30,i am an hourly worker in the us so this mainly applies to the laws here but it can apply anywhere that has similar wage laws the basic idea behind the 40 hour work week was great when it was adopted and it has given us a solid foundation to build off of in regards to overtime pay however people seem to forget that it is an arbitrary number that is only moderately connected to how we live our lives premise is that we should have 8 hours for work 8 hours for home and 8 hours for sleep that of course doesnt take into account a lot of what goes into the wotk day first theres the unpaid half hour or more for lunch second theres the commute that for me can average 45 minutes each way but for some people its even more than that already thats 10 hours centered around work instead of 8 and that doesnt even take into account a lot of the unpaid work that people do off the clock like receiving calls or answering emails at home this happens way too often and everyone is too afraid of negative consequences to refuse to be available after hours is happening at the same time as people are worrying about automation and the future of the labor force concepts like a universal basic income are pretty radical and could be a necessity in the future but i think they skip past a much simpler solution to keep people employed that being shortening the work week  know that france already has a 35 hour work week but i think that it should be shortened to 30 this could mean five 6 hour days or four 75 hour days or even three 10 hour days although i used to live in a state where anything over 8 hours was considered overtime regardless of how much you worked the rest of the week i still like that concept but will give it up in favor of this change some businesses would still want workers to put in more hours than that and would pay the overtime but others would have to hire more workers to make up the extra time  would work best with a strong increase to the national minimum wage so that workers whose hours get cut wouldnt necessarily see a huge pay cut as well as a universal health care system so that companies dont play the cut workers hours to avoid paying benefits game we also have to have a conversation about salaried employees and contractselfemployed work to make sure that companies dont circumvent hourly wage laws through those loopholes sure this will be met with a ton of resistance from business owners but we live in a society and workers need to be able to live and also have time to live ill change my mind on this if its entirely economically unsound or if theres a better way to go about it for clarification this would not automatically limit people to 30 hours just that overtime would kick in at anything over 30 hours instead of 40 also thanks to the great discussion here im rethinking this a bit due to the vast differences there are in how where and when people work,1,553,3005,80,0.05
cmv legislative bodies should be required to explain in formal writing why they voted a certain way when it comes to legislation,i think publicly elected officials responsible for driving policy and legislation should be required to explain why they vote certain ways in writing voting along party lines is reprehensible regardless of the side politics shouldnt be a game about which side wins but rather which factbased opinions win regardless of sides if the legislative bodies have no reasonable explanation for why they voted a certain way besides voting along party lines they should not be allowed to vote because we have no reason to believe that theyre not voting out of selfinterest if for example someone in congress voted against what seems to be reasonable gun law without explanation but you can see in their financial disclosure that the nra contributes a lot of money and support for them how are we to know that their vote was not influenced by the nra without them explicitly citing so and explaining what other reason compelled them not to vote for said reasonable legislation im not even asking for a long written response from them a short paragraph or page summary with sources theyre using to base their vote on is good enough ,1,192,1139,132,0.030303030303030304

cmv our society is replacing doing good with condemning bad as to how we gauge morality,"it seems over the past 510 years or so that western society has replaced doing good as a way to convey moral righteousness with condemning bad  rather than people engaging in acts of selflessness or kindness individuals are condemning the misdeeds of others and then using that as a basis for which to feel morally superior  this shift is causing tons of unintended consequences example instead of giving money to a school in a poor black neighborhood or volunteering at a soup kitchen in an area filled with struggling minorities people are jumping on twitter to bash something racist a celebrity said or signing a petition to have a someone who posted racist comments online fired from their job  while we can all agree that racism is bad the problem is that the vast majority of people arent really racist  yet tons of people are using well least im not a nazi as a way to feel good about how they live their lives  not only does this type of behavior foster a huge amount of complacency when it comes to actually taking action to do good to others it creates a watchdog environment where everyone is hyper focused on the behavior of those around them so they can be the first to condemn wrongdoing i dont really identify as some boomer neoconservative i kind of understand what they mean when they talk about virtue signaling  its this culture of outrage and constantly policing the behavior of others as opposed to silently helping those in need   illustrate this point one of my favorite pictures is a painting of jesus and a nazi guard walking together down a dirt road  in the painting jesus is carrying the mans pack and engaging in earnest conversation with him  what makes this picture so powerful is it shows jesus treating someone who we would consider the literal scum of the earth with kindness and love  while an ordinary person might think that the most morally right action to take when meeting a nazi is to treat them to a big old fuck you at best and violence at worst true compassion and love do not discriminate based on whether or not the person deserves them which is what makes them so powerful    heard a story a few weeks ago about a gunman that had gone into an amish community church or school or something i cant remember and killed and injured many people including children  despite the loss of life the amish community issued a statement just days after the shooting saying that they had forgiven the gunman  they werent saying what the man had done was okay but that they had forgiven him of his horrible crime  how starkly this story stands in contrast to the rabid calls for blood and thirst for the sort of justified revenge that our society especially in the us seems to crave desire to constantly denounce bad behavior is the driving force for why society seems to becoming increasingly divided along lines of race gender political views and religion as people largely influenced by the sharp decline in news media and journalism latch onto the misdeeds of specific demographics and then use it as a way to feel secure in their own mediocrity  because even if your moral righteousness only extends to you retweeting a snarky insult towards trump atleast yourre not a racistsexisthomophobe on reddit the front page is always covered with posts from rmaliciouscompliance rchoosingbeggars rmurderedbywords rprorevenge and rinceltears as people circlejerk themselves into a coma at the fact that they are better than these 1 of people who are stupidmeanbigotted or whatever you change my view  i feel like im the only one who thinks this way

cmv the military budget of the us is unnecessarily large and the militaristic goals of the us can be achieved with less funding,"it is my view that the us can achieve their militaristic goals with a significantly reduced military budget according to these numbers the amount spent by one country approaches half of the worlds total military expenditures when you consider the percentage of gdp spent on military the us at 33 is fairly average in spending but with the astronomical margin in gdp between the us and the rest of the world us military spending is miles beyond any other country and the disparity seems unnecessary  from their wiki the purpose of the us army is preserving the peace and security and providing for the defense of the united states the commonwealths and possessions and any areas occupied by the united states
 supporting the national policies
 implementing the national objectives
 overcoming any nations responsible for aggressive acts that imperil the peace and security of the united states  goals can be achieved with substantially less military funding cmv  my view was changed largely by the fact that the purpose of the us military is far more broad and essential to the current geopolitical landscape than i understood also several comments regarding past innovations of the military and a breakdown of why the us military costs more than that of other countries received deltas

cmv gender dysphoria is a mental disorder,this topic has already been discussed in this sub once before but i was left severely dissatisfied with this thread op barely reviewed or discussed the counterclaims presented blindly went along with whatever was being said from analysing the thread it seems clear that op got caught up in political correctness—causing no offense and respecting everyone—to the point where hisher capacity to critically analyse the refutations was diminished to the point where heshe just accepted them no questions asked respect everyone i firmly believe that discrimination and stigma only cause harm i dont intend to cause any offense on purpose however in the interest of an honest discussion i may offend someone thats the nature of discussing controversial topics such as gender identity and politics you cant get around offense if you want to have a meaningful rational discussion with this in mind if youre offended by my arguments—keep in mind that they dont come from a place of hatred or discrimination i wont apologise if youre offended though instead of complaining or feeling put down channel that energy into something positive and change my view  that preamble out of the way i want to outline my view fully so as to leave no room for misinterpretation 1 there are two biological sexes intersex is a term reserved for describing people with medical disorders such as chromosomal disorders malformed genitalia etc 2 gender is biologically dependent 99 of people identify as the same gender as their biological sex to deny that a causal relationship here is absurd cultural differences in masculine and feminine roles have a role to play theres a significant overlap of interests between men and women but it has been shown that as societies trend toward gender equality differences in temperament and interests between genders increase this suggests that gender differences between men and women are to an extent biologically dependent 3 gender is binary an individual may exhibit traits of varying masculinityfemininity some men may exhibit overwhelmingly feminine characteristics theres nothing wrong with this theres nothing wrong with identifying with these characteristics either in the same way that theres nothing wrong with identifying as a banker if you work at a bank 4 gender dysphoria gd is the distress a person feels due to a mismatch between their gender identity and their biological sex 5 identity is not the same as sexual orientation attraction the stress homosexuals and bisexuals feel come as a result of not feeling accepted by peers and society trans people dont feel this is enough—they desire to change their bodies to fit their identity 6 gd is a socially accepted delusion a delusion is an idiosyncratic belief or impression maintained despite being contradicted by reality or rational argument typically as a symptom of mental disorder reality you are a male body delusion you are a female you feel great stress and discomfort because you identify as a female trapped in a male body this denies the reality that you are in fact a male body i draw similarities here to anorexia—anorexics deny the reality that they are underweight their delusion is that they are overweight thus they feel compelled to lose weight in response to this delusion people experiencing gd feel compelled to change their sex in response to their delusion that they are not the sex they are both anorexia and gd are stigmatised to some extent in society one is socially accepted and encouraged the other is not 7 gd may or may not be able to be cured i draw no conclusions here the evidence on both sides is scarce on one hand some data suggest that sex reassignment surgery alleviates symptoms of gd the extent to which is debatable however some societies countries universities etc have recently taking the position that even considering gd as a potential mental illness is hate speech and offensive this prevents genuine research into the nature of gd and possible treatment in favour of giving in to the delusion in the form of hormone treatment and surgery 8 you can fight against discrimination and stigma while still recognising gd as a disorder just like you can fight against discrimination and stigma while recognising bipolar depression schizophrenia etc as mental disordersillnesses is wrong with exhibiting feminine traits if you’re a male and vice versa nothing is wrong with dressing outside cultural norms or identifying yourself with those behaviours and traits but if you are discontent with the body you are then you have a mental disorder look forward to hearing your rebuttals im glad to see this thread is generating some real discussion thanks everyone 2 ive realised after some discussion that there are some points in this post which i could have defined better and clarified further ive also had my view changed on certain points for the sake of reference though im going to leave the post above exactly how i originally wrote it,1,823,5235,42,0.11904761904761904
cmv pet ownership should be strictly regulated and licensed a prospective owner should be required to demonstrate their ability to care for an animal before a pet license is granted and an animal is purchased or ideally adopted,"hi folks think its commonly acknowledged that many pet owners are not fit to properly care for their animal aside from active abuse there is significant passive abuse that has been normalised in western cultures eg leaving codependent pets locked alone in small spaces for much of the day
 providing poor quality excessive or insufficiently varied diets
 providing insufficient mental or physical exercise
 raising animals in conditions that are antithetical to their natural environment this is a little subjective perhaps
 selling or giving away codependent pets when they no longer fit for purpose my dangerous idea that seems to be quite unpopular amongst everyone ive talked to is that pet ownership should be regulated and licensed in much the same way as human adoption it seems odd to me that we bring these animals into our lives to raise them essentially as our children but we dont seem to confer on them the same living conditions as we would a child view does not necessarily cover service or working animals thats a whole different matter do i want my view changed two reasons i have locked horns with some of my petowning friends about this their argument being that such regulations would restrict their freedom to own a thing that they want which is precisely the point i want to understand where theyre coming from and either they dont have the patience to articulate it in terms i can understand or i dont have the patience to understand how theyve articulated it im not sure which
2 i would really love to get a dog or cat as a companion animal but as a city dwelling working single person i feel very far from being able to morally do so considering the above if it were my job to set the terms on which a pet license is granted my current lifestyle and that of most citydwelling single folks would not pass muster that said please keep in mind that my cmv appeal is about the wider issue of pet ownership not my view that i shouldnt get a dog for reading ill try to engage as best i can ",1,360,2122,232,0.017241379310344827
cmv religion should not be able to be used as an excuse not to vaccinate a child who is being sent to public school,as a current high schooler i have just come to the realization that many kids at my school were not fully vaccinated as children despite the fact that these families had no religious objection to vaccination they were able to write it off as such and were allowed to send their kids to public school without the required vaccinations essentially this loophole opens the door to any antivaxxer regardless of their actual religious beliefs aside from this i don’t think religion should function as a valid exemption in the first place as far as i know the first amendment freedom of speech is restricted when you put others in danger for example the first amendment does not protect shouting “fire” in a crowded public place similarly the first amendment should not protect religion when it puts others in danger children who can’t be vaccinated because of health complications are put at risk by unvaccinated children therefore the same precedent should apply if parents don’t want to vaccinate their children for religious reasons or not then fine but don’t complain when they either die or are refused from attending public school everyone go look at the article about the chickenpox outbreak in nc that’s on the front page from rnews ,1,210,1267,116,0.034482758620689655
cmv jim halpert from the office is an asshole,"edit oh holy shit when i went to bed this thing had like ten comments and fifty upvotes not a whole lot of attention and i figured i could deal with whatever else trickled in overnight once i woke up at 350 comments that is well beyond my ability to do ill try to address as many as i can but sorry if i dont get to yours and glad so many of you like this topic 2 okay this is completely untenable for me at this point ive awarded two deltas so far and very well might find some more to hand out screening through other comments but im just playing wackamole at this point i cant write fast enough to address everything thats already here much less keep up with the rate of new replies if youre just coming to this conversation now i recommend you hop on one of the existing comment chains rather than reply to me directly at least if youre looking for a prompt response lockdown ive been rewatching the office us for like the tenth time and its just occurring to me that jim is kind of a dick  i think its easy to miss because hes written to be one of the protagonists of the show he makes us laugh and he is comparatively one of the few sanenormal people in the show but lets review he nurses an obsessive crush on pam for the first few seasons despite her being engaged to someone else sure roy is a bigger dick and not right for pam so we all root for him anyways but this is textbook not cool behavior you dont crush on someone elses so 
2 he pursues and invites katy to the booze cruise and then dumps her on the cruise when she didnt really know anyone there like you dont have to be with her but jfc man work on your timing dumping someone in public while theyre trapped on a boat with your coworkers is trashy 
3 he reports pam to hr because hes jealous shes with roy 
4 jim and pams first sober at least kiss happens after jim tells pam how he feels about her and pam shoots him down stating that they cant be together and that he misinterpreted signals jim has every right to be heartbroken about this and should go his own way and leave her alone what he actually does is follow her back into an empty office and kiss her without obtaining consent and directly disregarding that she told him she wasnt interested moments before 
5 as a result of being shot down he literally moves branches to go mope think about that i like a girl and she doesnt like me so i literally cant stand to be in an office with her thats not normal behavior 
6 he then gets intimate with karen despite still clearly being in love with pam strings her along down to scranton then gets upset that shes living too close to him and then dumps her in manhattan despite being her ride and drives back to scranton to try to get with pam 
7 he lies a lot these range from everything from little white lies about why he cant come to work to big lies like trying to cover up that michael is dating pams mom 
8 he didnt come to pams art show roy oscar and michael managed to and michael was the only one who was nice about it jim knows damn well art is a dream and a passion of pams and yet didnt make any time to come support a huge break in that dream 
9 pettily refused to get dwight some beer and pizza after dwight helped get jims kid to sleep 
10 bought a house for pam without asking her you can buy someone lunch or some jewelry without asking them you dont make hundredthousand dollar decisions without consulting your so 
11 similarly he takes the athlead job without consulting pam at all either even though itll impact her majorly meanwhile when pam does something big after properly consulting jim like going to art school he makes a big mopey deal about it 
12 invests 10000 in athlead without consulting pam also pam finds out jim is planning to move to philly from the frigging receiptionist at athlead 
13 despite living with pam for quite a while he only starts to act like an adult and actually clean up after himself when hes living with darryl and because darryl wants him to and of course he bails on pam and cece during all of this leaving her to raise their kid alone stating that he kind of enjoys living the bachelor life again 
14 misses ceces dance recital  
15 hes generally just a snarky and sarcastic asshole 
16 this one is a big one for me because its one of the things people love the most about jim his pranks again they make us laugh so sure theyre harmless but a good prank is supposed to make the pranked person laugh too jim doesnt do this he pranks people in ways that upset them often greatly and does so for his amusement and the amusement of others thats not pranking thats bullying and this is exacerbated by the fact that his three primary targets for pranks are andy dwight and michael all of whom are social oddballs and seemingly suffer from undiagnosed mental disorders again this is the behavior of a bully not a harmless prankster  is a noncomprehensive list im sure others could think of more ",1,945,5277,47,0.14893617021276595
cmv philosophy should be a mandatory subject in public schools taught from elementary to highschool and is equally if not more important than the other liberal arts disciplines english history etc,philosophy doesnt teach what to think merely how to think better  how to analyze arguments and see their merits and flaws  it can also give everyone a baseline understanding of concepts so people with differing views can have meaningful conversations  for example in america president obama has been labeled some form of socialistmarxist throughout his presidency by his political opponents  i understand this is merely a scare tactic used to rile up the conservative base  however this tactic would have been impossible if everyone had been required to have a rudimentary understanding of karl marxs theories   love him or hate him obama was certainly no hero of the proletariat  if a goal of public education is to produce citizens capable of critical thinking there is no better discipline to master  translates to other fields more so than most of not all other academic disciplines  this can allow students to find some aspect of philosophy to engage in that they will enjoy  the notion that theories have to be falsifiable in order to be considered science is a philosophical idea introduced by karl popper many of the ideals that america was founded on were based on the works of influential philosophers  freedom of religion arguments come from john locke  freedom of speech arguments from john stuart mill   of the important questions that we as a society wrestle with are philosophical questions  what role should government play in society what is justicefairness  what laws ought we have what values ought we hold  obviously having a background in philosophy wont automatically lead to agreement but it will give us a better way to think about these issues and allow people to draw much more well reasoned conclusions 1 im having a great time discussing this with everyone  it got way more traction than i was expecting  its 5am for me and i gotta try to get to sleep  ill try to respond to everyone who leaves a comment but i wont be able to reply at all for a few hours  thanks everyone 2  i just want to clarify because i know it wasnt clear from my original post  elementary school is a pretty big timeline  i think those who say 6 might be too early to try to talk about philosophy may have a valid point  im no early education expert  that being said based on my experience as a child i think anywhere from 1012 would be a perfectly reasonable age to start  right around 4th  5th grade  3 i am in no way advocating for any particular curriculum or any particular works or philosophers be mandatory reading only that there should be something people a lot smarter than me can create the actual curriculum  and on a similar note i am also not saying advanced concepts need to be taught from day one  math starts with knowing numbers then counting then additionsubtraction  then multiplicationdivision etc etc the same way we dont start kids out with the quadratic formula we dont need to start out with the most advanced philosophic argumentsconcepts 4 i regret bringing up the name of karl marx  this has become a much bigger distraction to my main point than i ever intended   for anyone new to this post if you have specific issue with marx please note that i was just trying to give an example  im not saying marx should or shouldnt be taught by anyone at anytime   nor was i trying to make any statement about the merits of obamas policy  only that based on an understanding of marxist philosophy obama is not marxist  and anyone saying he is shouldnt be taken seriously,1,649,3626,201,0.01990049751243781
cmv electoral reform is a more important issue than gun control abortion capital punishment and blm us,fptp and single member districts is why we have a two party system fptp has no advantages over other methods while severely restricting the choices voters can actually make other methods like schulze ensure that the candidate that wins would beat any other in a head to head race there are other things that i think should be changed like the electoral college and partisan gerrymandering but this is the only one that i think is totally noncontroversial there is no perfect voting method but rcv or schulze is simply better than fptp  the constitution was made single member districts made more sense but now ideologies and political issues have much less to do with region proportional representation or a hybrid like multi member districts would allow for a much wider variety of ideologies in the government that actually represent what the electorate believes in is the foundation of our government if the way that we elect our candidates is broken everything else is broken if we fixed these issues you could vote for the candidate that fits your views best without fear of wasting your vote electing candidates that fit our beliefs leads to a government that better supports our beliefs reason why i chose the things that i did in my title is because i feel like they are very divisive issues that candidates and pundits spend a lot of time talking about but are relatively inconsequential  that you can change my view me that in places that have better voting methods things arent differentare worse me that single member regional representation is a better system than multimember or proportional representation dont think youll change my mind about the electoral college or fptp but you can try,1,291,1774,108,0.08333333333333333
cmv there are regions where you should not be allowed to have large greengrass lawns,in general i find  monolithic grass lawns unaesthetic and poor use of land but there have been other cmv posts engaging with the labor and aesthetic  part of it so i want to discuss a specific environmental component and for disclosure i am an environmental scientist so educated but also possibily biased on this topic accept that many people have aesthetic or practical reasons for wanting grass lawns and there will always be a component of personal control over their land and that there are regions where it can be minimally impactful  when i fly over arizona for example and see vast expanses of green lawns in the middle of the dessert and dont get me started on golf courses i cant help but think that its a selfish travesty  in a region with severe water scarcity issues only getting worse to think that people decide to put in large lawns of plants that would never thrive there naturally because fundamentally these are decisions  that impact everyone in a community not just you from  largest use of potable water in arizona is for landscaping and as much as 70 percent of residential water use is outdoors   in addition to the water usebenefits there is of course the damage done to delicate desert ecosystems which are among the slowest to recover i frankly just dont see how the possible benifts of having a lawn recreation aesthetics etc  outweigh these negatives i know there are some initiatives in az to encourage people to take out grass and put in turfnative plants  but i dont think that goes far enough i think if you really want a lawn to layout on or whatever you should be allowed to have something like a 25x25 patch and thats it maybe if you really want more you can pay a heavy tax or a much higher water rate for lawn needs that goes to water managementconservation but i know those policies can be difficult in practice and to those who will accuse gov overreach i dont see a significant difference between this and other building codes designed to protect natural resources like having to get permission to cut down certain trees or not being allowed to destroy wetlands on your property for another example i personally live in a coastal stormprone area and native plants are a very important part of buffering storm surges so i think i am understandably angry when i see waterfront properties with coastal veg removed and big lawns in their place this quite directly impacts the security of my home and then of course the indirect impacats like all the fertilzer needed to grow a big lawn on sandy ground unsuited to which in turn goes into the bay and leads to algaeo blooms and fish kills from excess nitrogen loading this is an instance where i strongly belive that if you decide that you want to have waterfront property that you take on the resposibility for stewarding that vital interface and should not be allowed to replace it with a lawn and for properties that are already lawns i think they should have to pay an addittional fee for coastal management but should also be able to recieve susidies for converting to more sustainable sollutions and if you decide that a big lawn is that central to your well being and identity live somewhere else where a lawn makes sense same way you dont move to southern florida and get mad when you cant have a basement can think of plenty of other examples from southern california to south africa where lawn watering is a signifcant uneccesay use in drought prone areas as you can probably tell i feel strongly about this but im always looking to get other perspectives to help find compromises,1,644,3977,86,0.046511627906976744
cmv maternity and paternity leave should both be mandatory and equal in all aspects,cmv know from several people i know that they actively though secretly discriminate against women aged around 2535 when it comes to hiring new job applicants the reason at least the stated reason being that they worry they will become pregnant and take months of paid maternity leave so will all things being equal prefer to hire a man or a woman of a different age to avoid that possibility the thing isthis seems perfectly reasonable most women will have a kid somewhere in that age bracket and they will take time off from work and rightly so we should be supporting women and by extension the next generation to have a healthy and happy childhood thing is that it seems to me that if the same onus fell on men and they were required to take time off work for children of which they are the legal parent then workplaces would have one fewer and presumably a very significant one reason to discriminate against women in the hiring process,1,170,984,84,0.05952380952380952
cmv obi wan kenobi might not have been the strongest or most powerful jedi but he was the jedi mvp,almost everything obi wan did he did right the only mistake he really made was not seeing what was happening to anakin earlier and failing to stop it other than that hes accomplished more than any other jedi he defeated the first sith seen in a thousand years after it killed his master he trained two of the most powerful jedis of all time he dedicated the rest of his life after order 66 to protecting luke skywalker he defeated general grevious when no one else could he found he clone army he defeated and maimed anakin so badly in their duel that he was way less powerful and was not able to reach his full potential in addition to all of this he is one of the few jedi shown to truly embody the jedi code he never let his feelings cloud his judgement unless you count sparing anakin but it can be argued this was the jedi way the only jedis who come close to beating obi wan for mvp are yoda and mace windu however neither of their accomplishments overshadow obi wans obi wan truly is the jedi mvp,1,192,1025,100,0.11
cmv its oxymoronic to fly both the confederate and union flags,despite this post being partially about the confederate flag it isnt about whether or not its a hate symbol this sub is for changing views and my stance on that topic is pretty staunch anyway ive seen many americans flying the stars and stripes on their trucks or houses or whatever thats fine nothing wrong with that i personally find it a bit odd to fly your countrys flag while youre inside that country but whatever you do you what strikes me as queer to the point of bizarre is when they usually southerners also fly the confederate flag sometimes on the same vehicle werent the csa and usa at war werent they enemies didnt one in a manner of speaking conquer the other why would you fly the flag representing your states and the flag of the coalition that beat them at war this being a trivial matter im very much open to information thank you all for your comments and spirited debating i didnt expect this to get more than a handful of responses but apparently this has blown up a bit im writing this so if you dont get a reply and feel im ignoring just know i dont have the time but i am still reading 2 so many people have made the obvious word play it can stop now please,1,225,1255,65,0.06153846153846154

cmv the shape of water is an extremely overrated movie and should have never won the oscar for best picture,i recently rewatched the shape of water and i am not a movie critique nor expert but the realization dawned on me that it is an exquisitely bland movie that lacks an absurd amount of substance the shape of water plays on to the basic beauty and the beast trope but it does not go any further than that the movie weighs heavily on the cinematography and strays away from any actual plot or substance it is an intermediate form of movie writing and does not deserve any more than a redbox rental the movie barely dives into the actual underlying foundation for why anything happens there is no room for individual thought and it is pressed into the viewer’s brain that there is only one way to think and that is with the protagonist according to vox it’s a beautifully shot movie with a story that follows the traditional arcs of a fairy tale romance i believe that it is exactly why it should not have won it has been done before compared to other past winners such as moonlight which was original and intriguing is no relevance to the shape of water no bigger picture a mute woman falls in love with a sea creature who likes eggs if that’s the precedent for winning an oscar then the leprechaun would have been a phenomenal candidate the movie is visually outstanding but so is the curious case of benjamin button and it is an incredibly lifeless movie starring brad pitt without the visuals the movie would merely be a pathetic case for an “original” plot quite honestly coming from guillermo del toro i would not expect much all of his movies rely on visuals such as crimson peak or the hobbit these movies appeal to the eye and the only oscar that this movie truly deserved was best visuals the movie is basic with jaw dropping visuals the movie won four oscars so it is obviously well received and i’d like to understand what is so special about its standard format change my view,1,345,1935,108,0.08333333333333333
cmv parents who refuse vaccination of their children must sign a form of accountability so if their child dies from medical complications that would have been avoided by a larger than 90 consensus of global medical research they can be charged with the appropriate crimes for their negligence,from my understanding which isnt vast on this particular subject as i am not personally a parent a child can begin their doctorpatient confidentiality between 1416 depending on the state the lifelong medical complications that arise from unvaccinated children generally have begun by this time and that makes me believe that the accountability of the parent up to that point should be addressed and issued  are a family choice as there are no laws that im aware of requiring them but the risk that the defenseless child and for that matter the public surrounding these unvaccinated children are put to should have some legal recourse to the parents or guardians if there is a fatal or detrimental illness that could have been avoided as a result of their decision to not vaccinate i believe that it is fair for the consensus of medical professionals and their research to be a legitimate basis for a contract that holds parents accountable for their decision to disregard all of this if their child  is harmed irreparably this contract would allow local or state law enforcement agencies and child protective services to issue charges on the parents if they deemed necessary in the case of the parents negligence in addition to opening the possibility of the child to sue the parents for their negligence in the future if they decide to assuming they survive as well  forms of child abuse are prosecuted this issue should be the same i agree that not vaccinating should be a choice but there should be accountability and im not aware of any a parent refusing vaccinating their child and this results in them dying of an otherwise preventable illness by consensus research is the same as drowning them in a bath tub i realize that last sentence is controversial and assume it to be taken out of context but think of this very rarely do unvaccinated children die immediately from the illnesses they acquire as a result of being unvaccinated giving plenty of time for professionals to be recommending and diagnosing that the illness can be treated but the parent refuses they are refusing to do the thing that treats or cures their childs illness despite all evidence to the fact their ignorance or paranoia is no excuse to not deem this child abuse at the least and murder at the most people get their children taken away for so many reasons in countries that turn a blind eye to holding accountability for preventable deaths  am willing to accept that i may be missing some large angles here but i dont know what they are i hope that i explained myself well but its hard to fully express anything without a discussion i welcome anyone with a contrary or parallel point of view ,1,470,2739,298,0.013422818791946308

cmv  all jobs should be required to state the exact salary for a given role up front next to the other crucial details of the job,im sick of seeing job advertisements that simply detail the salary as competitiveand thats it as soon as you start the process of applying theres literally no mention of the salary they want me to sell myself to them and talk about why im passionate without addressing the main reason why im getting a job which is to earn some damned money fact id say that the salary is the number one most important thing i care about in a job and thus i expect to be told it at the same time if not before all the other details of employment this would really crack down on gender pay gaps  you cant exactly pay people differently depending on ethnicity or gender if the wage is stated on the advertisement all just seems a bit backwards to me i get theres the potential issue of people wanting to keep their salary private but that seems like a small price to pay no pun intended for full pay equality and companies not scamming me into employment with their competitive salary how about you tell me what the salary is and ill decide for myself if its fuckin competitive thanks to all of you who raised very valid points and sorry to those who i didnt get around to replying to  i spent two hours yesterday replying to posts and i had more notifications at the end of the two hours than at the start so i ultimately gave up i hope that for the ones i did reply to i offered some constructive counter arguements to peoples points and conceded good arguements where they arose and ultimately provided a half decent debate for you all still believe that overall there should be more transparency to what wages are in advance but ill consider my view has changed to respect the following if the salary is posted as a flat figure employees lose the right to negotiate it and employers lose the right to offer more attractive due to skill experience etc employees more money to entice then in this could be remedied by using a starting from figure that could be increased if applicants showed a higher than necessary level of aptitude for a role  although someone did point out this removes the ability for an employer to offer an underqualified candidate less money if they wanted to take that chance a lot of you raised the point that while it would be convenient for employees to know the salary in advance it wouldnt benefit the employer to have to post such a thing therefore this would be a bit of a crap law to pass i didnt reply to the majority of these because it was past the 2 hour mark when i had given up but its a solid point that i would have to concede it is not detrimental to ask an employer for their salary range so you would never really have to apply to a job without knowing the salary i thought that by asking this you would make it seem like you are only interested in the money something that is of course true in a lot of places but employers dont like to hear but i was wrong about that the last interesting point was raised by someone in the comments and that was essentially that instead of advertising the salary range in the job listings all employees should be required to disclose the salarys of their employees probably in an anonymous way so applicants know they are getting a fair wage and employees also know they arent being discriminated against i think this was the best point anyone raised and if i was going to cmv to anything it would be this congrats udefunctwalrus,1,634,3519,132,0.08333333333333333
cmv legalize all drugs yes even that one,the war on drugs from the beginning has been a massive unconstitutional assault on the rights of americans it has not worked it has never worked it has led to the rise of gangs it must be ended immediately and incarcerated prisoners in jail for nonviolent drug offenses should be released and have their records expunged and after this is done we need to fully legalize all drugs prohibiting drugs has led to the rise in gang violence before criminalization if a drugstore was selling methamphetamines and was robbed they could simply call the police and report stolen property but after criminalization someone who sold methamphetamines or other drugs could not call the police to defend their property because what they are doing is illegal so the dealer would have to defend his property with weapons and friends and friends with weapons legalizing drugs would rid society of drug gangs in modern society you will find one of everything everything except for violent alcohol gangs again i am working off the model of prohibition day one after prohibition ended alcohol gangs disappeared because they could no longer sustain themselves after being undercut by legal legitimate businesses selling the same stuff they were but safer i see no reason this shouldn’t apply to drugs we would not have to worry about drug importation from the southern border anymore either the war on drugs is extremely unconstitutional and illegal for multiple reasons first of it imposes the ideals of puritanism and abstinenceonly morality on american society which violates the establishment clause who’s to say the belief that all mind altering molecules are a divine gift from some god for human kind to cultivate harvest refine synthesize and consume at our discretion for whatever recreational spiritual or medicinal purposes we deem appropriate is any less valid than someone’s belief in christianity second it is written in history that if the federal government wants to ban a substance they need a constitutional amendment to do so 18th amendment there are no constitutional amendments banning drugs meaning the federal government is overstepping it’s constitutional bounds next the biggest constitutional violation is the violation of the 4th amendment rights to bodily autonomy and privacy also supported by the due process clause of the 14th amendment which ultimately decided roe v wade amended by casey and i’m not done yet you have legislation such as mandatory minimum sentences and the crack cocaine disparity act which clearly violate our eighth amendment rights against cruel and unusual punishments so that poor marginalized people get their lives ruined and spend decades in prison for selling drugs to consenting adults but jeffery epstein rapes hundreds of childeren and serves 14 months with 72 hours weekly work release and then a free pass to violate parole idea of legalizing drugs leaves some with a bad taste in their mouth but i leave you with this question if heroin was legal would you do it would you go to walgreens buy the expensive powder and a syringe and a lighter would you put it in a spoon hold the lighter under the spoon until it melts fill up the syringe with the molten tonic stick it in your arm and push it in just because it’s legal my guess is no because you understand like i do that heroin is bad for you and not worth it i suppose in the end america would have to make a decision do we despise victimless drug use or gang violence more i believe gang violence is the worst offense my view,1,596,3612,44,0.11363636363636363

cmv transgender people should disclose they are transgender before engaging in physically intimate acts with another person,im really struggling with this   to me it just seems wrong to not tell the person your actual sex before engaging in intimacy  if i identify as a straight man and you present yourself as a straight woman but you were born a man it seems very deceitful to not tell me that before we make out or have sex  you are not respecting my sexual preferences and more or less tricking me into having sex with a biological male   im having a lot of trouble analogizing this  if im exclusively attracted to redheads and i have sex with you because you have red hair but i later find out you colored your hair and are actually brunette that doesnt seem like a big deal  i dont think you should be required to tell me you died your hair before we make out   im attracted only to beautiful people and i find out you were ugly and had plastic surgery to make yourself beautiful that doesnt seem like a big deal either the transgender thing just feels different to me and im having trouble articulating exactly why  obviously if the point of the sex is procreation it becomes a big deal but if its just for fun how is it any different from not disclosing died hair or plastic surgery   think it would be wrong not to disclose a sex change operation  i think there is something fundamental about being gaybistraight and you are being deceitful by not disclosing your actual sex my view  i gotta go  ill check back in tomorrow or if i have time later tonight this is a footnote from the cmv moderators wed like to remind you of a couple of things firstly please read through our rules if you see a comment that has broken one it is more effective to report it than downvote it speaking of which downvotes dont change views any questions or concerns feel free to message us happy cmving,1,346,2091,125,0.032
cmv ignoring nuclear energy is a big middle finger for the planet and experts on the field while making climate change not look like a crisis at all,"the  fight against green house emissions is focused on one big  transformation the energy sector whose trending solution of the  present is to use renewable energy to eletrify everything we can and to  produce hydrogen with everything we cant eletrify biofuels for  extreme scenarios trying  to achieve such goals our natural gas consumption is rising since its  a perfect fit for the variability of renewable energy  most countries ditch on nuclear energy which is the perfect  replacement for coal power plants discussions surrounding it tend to  compare it with variable renewable energy vre and tend to be biased  of solar and wind are cheaper than gas at the moment are common and  unfair since they do not account with longterm storage any time and  makes a bad comparison against any type of established energy  further increased when nuclears main problem are costs which is a  very respected argument yes while gas is truly cheaper than nuclear  and although it emits ghg it can provide everything nuclear can  energywise but vre alone cannot on top of this the decomission of  solar and wind is rarely put into consideration these include  unrecyclable blades and foundations of concrete that are not removed  from the environment and solars toxic electronics that can be more  dangerous than nuclear waste they also come with big ignored costs  while nuclear energy takes it into account  worst is the hype surrounding hydrogen if it ever comes to reality it  doesnt become only a storage solution it becomes a necessity for  transport and  or heat as such this necessity cannot be based only on  the excess of vre so again we will be dependant on the most  available process steam reforming natural gas the funny thing is that  even here nuclear can help as itsresidual heat is a free source of  energy to produce hydrogen which usually is dissipated into the water  going to waste am not saying  nuclear is asolution of everything but its a damn good proven help  economics constraints should not be a reason alone to not adopt it this  energy density would allow us to further evolve ourselves and there  are tons of things humans put money on for the betterment of humankind  such as space exploration  mention chernobyl but this was one in a kind accident almost half a  century ago and experts did tons of work for the betterment of the  technology meanwhile a banqiao dam breaks in china kills several  hundred thousand on people while putting millions without home and  eletricity but noone is scared of them because they do not fear it  they cant even imagine it happening to them  technology has problems that can be improved and bettered and plenty of motivated people are working on making it better cheaper safer but it seems that we live in a moment where supporting renewable energy and ditching  everything else is the good thing to do even if that is actually  making our progress slower in the fight against climate change  fear the complexity of nuclear energy such as they fear more airplanes  than cars although everyone knows that cars kill way more persons than  airplanes ever did nuclear is the shrek that the city is afraid of  even if he does save the princess at the end long as this fear of a clean dense and wellestablished technology  and disregard of decades of hardwork done from highly inteligent  people are we really allowed to say that we are facing a climatechange  crisis

cmv gender theory relies on sexism or it falls apart,so ive mentioned this in other places and have never gotten a satisfactory answer my view gender theory relies on extremely rigid and outdated gender norms to formulate a spectrum of gender   example what would be called a tomboy in the 1980s or so would now be considered presenting as less female than say a makeup wearing cheerleader who always wears skirts but ask a tomboy who isnt in on modern gender theory if wanting to climb trees makes her less of a woman i dare you a usmc combat veteran i served with ladies who were in the lioness program female marines in potentially combat roles they cursed spit and could kick the shit out of guys like milo yiannoupolos that doesnt make them any more male than him and it doesnt make him female closest thing to an adequate answer is that none of these things matter for gender there is in fact no metric whatsoever for gender its just a state of mind with no real characteristics which makes it entirely useless and fictional feminine is sometimes defined as being more nurtering by gender theory people but that also implies that being nurturing makes you somehow less male which i guess means that fathers are less manly than guys that cant handle parenthood that cant be right honestly want to have my view changed because i really dont want to start off every discussion on the subject with the nagging feeling that im talking to a bigot but nothing has so much as nudged me in that direction being a tomboy doesnt make you less female being a good father doesnt make you less male,1,280,1616,54,0.16666666666666666
cmv public schools should be required to teach factual discernment and media literacy as a part of regular curriculum the same as math science social studies etc,"i graduated from a public high school in the united states and do not have a large depth of understanding into the education systems of other countries so this post will only apply to american institutions  of your political affiliation “fake news” is a real problem that has only become further exacerbated by the massive rise of the influence of social media a huge amount of americans now receive the majority of their news from facebook which is a platform incentivized not to educate but to hold users attention for as long a period of time as possible the consequence of this is a rapid increase in the amount of sensationalized if not downright fabricated media we as americans are consuming  was on the debate team when i was in high school years ago the first thing we learned before ever delivering a speech was how to correctly research facts and how to determine the legitimacy of a source i personally never received this education anywhere else during my time in school the importance of this knowledge is that i can feel confident that my political opinions and world views may be subjective but they are based in reality and fact  believe that the most important element going into discourse is that all parties agree on the facts and background of the topic prior to engaging in discussion i understand that reintroducing something like the 1949 fairness doctrine is unrealistic and possibly even unnecessary i say this because i believe as per our first amendment rights that media outlets like the drudge report infowars and the huffington post have every right to espouse whatever rhetoric they choose  major problem with our political system today though largely impacting our polarized climate is that people can choose to subscribe only to the news outlets that already support their opinions  need to agree on the unarguable facts before we can attempt to understand each other and the laws that affect us vaccines do not cause autism human activity is impacting the global climate our drinking water is not turning the frogs gay  are legitimate publications that deliver unbiased factual reporting and there are others that deliver opinion pieces and mistruths americans should be educated during their formative years to know the difference so that they then have the knowledge base to be able to form their own legitimate political views regardless of what side of the political spectrum they fall on  is why i believe we should have standardized curriculum in public schools to teach young americans what media they can trust and what media they should be skeptical of change my view  note
this post is not about any particular issue or a criticism of any particular outlet convincing me that huffington post or infowars is legitimate will not change my view what the mutually agreed upon sources we reference in this proposed standardized model are is not the discussion this post is about universally establishing the ability to identify trustworthy media as part of our education system",1,513,3095,166,0.018072289156626505
cmv pornography in the form that it is commonly consumed nowadays graphic videos and images is not mentally healthy to consume in any dose by anyone,not trying to espouse nofap propaganda here just want to get that out of the way first studies ive seen and heard about are pointing in the direction that consumption of explicit graphic porn downright changes the structure of the brain in a way which makes it difficult to be aroused from more normal stimuli sexual partners not unlike how consuming large andor consistent doses of mdma or  similar drugs makes it difficult to produce and process serotonin believe it also hampers ones ability to have a sexual imagination which id argue is an important thing for a person who is or wants to be sexually active as with the consumption of all products theres no way to know for sure if the people being filmed are safe or consenting to what they are being filmed doing this could mean that my clicks are aiding and abetting sex trafficking conclude by openly admitting that i simply feel a lot of shame around my desire to watch pornography so i may be simply giving words to this shame i also was a fapstronaut for a year or so and very much believed the claims they made so would be curious if anyone had any input regarding the efficacy of nofap abstaining from masturbation entirely sometimes also also from sex as well,1,221,1272,152,0.02631578947368421
cmv the comforts of modern life should make us euphoric and the fact that they dont is troubling because it suggests the human perspective is critically flawed,"today i awoke in a temperaturecontrolled room shared with my lifes partner on a piece of furniture specifically engineered for comfort while sleeping i slept soundly thanks to the lack of interruption due to predators or pests when i awoke i walked over a cushioned and carpeted path into a room designed for my personal cleanliness before washing myself in the luxury of temperaturecontrolled water with various soaps and liquids specifically engineered for caring for my skin  
 this i dried myself with a fluffed cotton towel before pulling clean colorful clothing from a 1500 dresser set i retrieved my stateoftheart cellular device before reviewing the variety of communications waiting for me from friends and loved ones along with educating myself on daily news events with the swipe of a finger  
 then pressed a button to produce a brewed coffee more delicious than any trading post would have dreamed of 100 years ago while adding gourmet hazelnut flavoring i fed my pleasant fur companions all of which who were happy and in good health i hopped into the cushioned seat of my car which is worth several thousand dollars selected the exact artist and song from the last 50 years that i wished to listen to and then moved 3 times faster in my car than what would be biologically possible all while breathing in air at the exact temperature i find comfortable  
 this short journey i arrived at a temperaturecontrolled building greeted with a task that if completed correctly would grant me more 13x the pay that an average subsaharan african would make in the same day while doing so i once again selected the exact musical artist from a selection of millions that would suit my tastes for the day at no point was i concerned with hunger sickness predators violence or any other of the standard unpleasantness that have been faced daily by 99 of all mammals that have ever existed yet throughout this process i grumbled over my alarm grumbled over work grumbled over my budget grumbled over what others had that i did not etc etc  
 comparing my life to someone in the same country at a similar social class 200 years ago my life is incredible and filled with conveniences and luxuries that they couldnt even dream of and even those people in the 1800s were living lives that were free of most of the burdens that other living things face daily so why hasnt the modern american had an increase in happiness that correlates with the increase in improved quality of life over the last 300 years

cmv democrat response to tara reade shows kavanaugh uproar was more about stopping candidate they didnt like rather than respecting fords allegations,i firmly believe both political parties are subject to this type of behavior this is not limited to democrats only  republicans have no claim to moral high ground when nominating president trump   personally i voted third party in 2016 because i couldnt vote for clinton or trump the uproar regarding dr fords allegations so many democrats came out and said quite strongly to believe the woman she faces so many negative consequences very true by coming forward that by the nature of making the allegations she deserves to be heard  her story dominated the news cycle for quite some time  but now that allegations of sexual harassment and criminal behavior have been directed at a prominent democratic person presidential nominee so many democrats either ignore the story or  contradict their own earlier statements of believe the woman biden himself included back at the kavanaugh process through the current light it seems so many democrats rallied around dr fords allegations not because they believed the moral principal of believe the woman but because they didnt like kavanaugh as a candidate frustration largely is that democrats are seen as the party of moral high ground  when in reality it is democrats believe and support women fighting to share their story except when it is inconvenient to do so  to my  view this means no differentiation between democrats or republicans regarding claims of sexual harassment or assault by women democrats truly wanted to follow their stated belief of believe the woman they would nominate bernie sanders as the candidate cant reconcile current treatment of biden with the treatment of kavanaugh by democrats if you can please change my view so as i have been engaging with readers over the last hour the wsj just posted an editorial that engages with what ive been trying to write  heres the link   its behind a paywall so i will post the contents as a reply to my original post  i would really like to hear from unuclearthrowaway1234 and uhowlin on this article 2 apparently i cant post the contents of the article as a separate comment to my original post let me try and figure out a way to get it so everyone can read it 3  i copied and pasted the entire article and posted it as a reply to the top comment by unuclearthrowaway1234 for those that want to read it   best option i could do 4 thank you everyone for sharing your opinions and perspectives  ive tried to read most of the responses and the vast majority were well written and articulate responses that give hope to a responsible american people regardless of who the politicians in power are  further it was encouraging to me to see biden come out and personally deny the allegations  regardless of the truthfulness of who is right him or reade it shows respect for us as americans who need a response from the accused   his silence was frustrating to me  i look forward to more evaluation by the media leaders in power and the american public to vote for who they think the next president should be  i appreciate your contribution to the dialogue and changing the outdated response that men in power should be given the benefit of the doubt yet also acknowledging the challenges when accusations are made and the need for evidence and evaluating both sides of the story  ,1,590,3606,153,0.06535947712418301
cmv at least one third party candidate should be allowed in the national debates regardless of their polling percentage,"right now the rule is a candidate needs to poll at 15 to be in the national debate a lot of people including myself think this is terribly unfair and prevents any real chance of a third party candidate being taken seriously
i think they should take the candidate from a third party that polls the highest among all the third party candidates and let them in the debate regardless of their numbers
ex 
party a candidate 3
party b candidate 5
party c candidate 4 b candidate should be allowed to debate even though they haven’t hit the 15 threshold 
having a third party candidate that’s taken seriously will help ensure that the two main parties are sending up the best person for the job rather than somebody that can simply beat the candidate from the other party plus it will give people a viable third option  rather than feeling g trapped into voting one or the other or “throwing your vote away”
and finally it gives more versatility as far as people aligning with the appropriate party aoc said herself that bernie sanders does not belong in the same party as joe biden i think this is absolutely true however the only shot bernie had at becoming president was to run as a democrat if third parties were more recognized he could run as an independent or a different more progressive party and thus more followers identify as that and a new party rises this is essentially how the republican party was originally formed
just to be clear my case isn’t that bernie isn’t a democrat or something like that it’s the third party debate part you",1,274,1583,121,0.03305785123966942
cmv a coding course offering a flat £500 discount to women is unfair inefficient and potentially illegal,"temp account because i do actually want to still do this course and would rather there arent any ramifications for just asking a question in the current climate my main account probably has identifiable information but theres a coding bootcamp course im looking to go on in london which costs a hell of a lot anyway but when i went to the application page it said women get a £500 discount the precedent for this kind of thing is this kind of financial positive discrimination legal in the uk i was under the impression genderracedisability are protected classes im pretty sure this is illegal if it was employment just not sure about education but then again there are probably plenty of scholarships and bursaries for protected classes maybe this would fall under that its just it slightly grinds my gears because most of the women i know my age early 30s are doing better than the men although theres not much between it their aim is to get more people in general into coding its particularly inefficient because theyd scoop up more men than women if they applied the discount evenly although if their goal is to change the gender balance in the industry it might help although it does have the externality of pissing off people like me not that they probably care about that haha im all for more women being around ive worked in many mostly female work environments but not if they use financial discrimination to get there theres better ways of going about it that arent so zero sum and benefit all be honest ill be fine ill put up with it but its gonna be a little awkward being on a course knowing that my female colleagues paid less to go on it i definitely hate when people think rights are zero sum and its a contest but this really did jump out at me just wondering peoples thoughts ive spoken to a few of my friends about this and it doesnt bother them particularly both male and female although the people whove most agreed with me have been female ironically change my view  it would certainly help my prospects so i think im gonna stop replying because i am burnt out  ive also now got more karma in this edgy temp account than my normal account which worries me haha  id like to award the d to everyone youve all done very well and for the most part extremely civil  even if i got a bit shirty myself a few times  sorry  had my view changed on a few things it is probably just about legal under uk law at the moment
 and its probably not a flashpoint for a wider culture war for most companies its just they view it as a simple market necessity that they need a more diverse workforce for better productivity and morale  which may or may not be true  the jury is still out
 generally i think ive lightened my opinions on the whole thing and will definitely not hold it against anyone not that i think i would have still dont think the problem warrants this solution though i think the £500 would be better spent on sending a female coder into a school for a day to do an assembly teach a few workshops etc it addresses the root of the problem doesnt discriminate against poorer men empowers young women a female coder gets £500 and teaches all those kids not to expect that only men should be coders  and doesnt piss off entitled men like me p i will admit that on a slightly separate note that if i make it in this career id love for there to be more women in it and id champion anyone who shows an interest im hanging onto my damn 500 quid though haha  i just dont think this is the best way to go about it  to all the female coders and male nurses and all you other billy elliots out there i wish you the best of luck",1,694,3816,108,0.037037037037037035
cmv those who hate on fat people are not genuinely concerned about their health they just find fat people repulsive,i would love to be convinced that you are genuinely sooo concerned about the health of a total stranger that you feel the need to leave comments on their social media and devote entire subreddits to your hatefulness because you’re just incredibly concerned about their heart and blood sugar levels give me a break why can’t people just admit they find fat people gross why try to justify it with some faux concern about their wellbeing  how i know it’s bull if you see a pic of a skinny person you don’t see comments asking whether they smoke cigs how much they drink whether they ate too little or exercised too much whether they slept well whether they drank 8 glasses of water that day whether they purged to fit into that swimsuit why because it’s ridiculous and none of your business and impossible to give an accurate health assessment based on a photo even if you’re a doctor which these weird haters generally are not  anorexia is the most deadly mental disorder not binge eating anorexia yet i don’t see half of the “disgust” and outrage over pics of extremely skinny women as i do over larger women people might express some kind concern in the most extreme cases and i’m talking ribs showing but then it’s mostly kind and gentle without name calling or cruel judgments  just need people to be honest and say that fat bodies gross them out you really don’t care if that overweight man has a heart attack you just don’t and if you did what in the world makes you think leaving judgmental comments is going to help do you think fat people don’t know they’re fat like this is some special revelatory fact that only you were able to impart it’s generally a bit taboo to comment on another person’s health and diagnose them unless they specifically ask yet fat people often don’t receive that consideration they aren’t afforded that dignity  really isn’t super personal for me i’ve been big i’ve been small never extreme in either direction but i know lots of people who do fit into an extreme category and the way they’re treated has always baffled me at the very least be straight up with your hatred don’t hide okay this blew up while i was sleeping so let me say one more thing a lot of this thread shows me that there is a real empathy problem at the core of a lot of this you don’t know what anyone is going through people like to say fat people with legit medical issues causing weight gain are rare but this totally ignores mental health depression and anxiety are just a few mental disorders that come to mind it’s also interesting that people acknowledge that those who binge and purge suffer from mental illness but those who simply binge are lazy slobs who have no excuse again you have no idea what a person is going through  and contrary to popular belief tons of meds cause weight gain as an unintended side effect the cruel irony is that some of those meds are precisely what people take to deal with their mental health issues lots of people have messaged me privately about their struggles highlighting the cruelty they’ve experienced for existing in a fat body the truth is i don’t care how you feel about fat people but you don’t have the right to make judgments and play internet doctor and tell people how to deal with their own medical issues it’s wrong and in my view an insincere way of communicating your disgust for another person’s body and that’s not okay,1,618,3501,118,0.0847457627118644

cmv public outrage about the wackier fringe of sjws is entirely disproportionate to the actual size of the phenomenon and is being deliberately stoked by those who oppose fair and equitable treatment for women and minorities,additionally id say that progressives who publicly mock the small weirdo fringe of the sjw movement are acting as useful idiots for the far right and effectively doing their work for them  misunderstand me though im a full advocate for freedom of speech laws and the right of anyone to say anything they want short of violent threats is a moral issue not a legal one of course its your right to say and joke about anything but i personally think that biting your tongue is better for the legitimate progressive movement than drawing even more attention to the weirdo fringe people dont represent what the vast majority of people who are passionate about social justice are about  the category of unwitting idiots i have a number of youtube channels in mind theyve pivoted in recent years to focus quite heavily on videos focusing on the more outrageous sjws on the internet  those weirdos exist and yes its your right to make a living mocking them but its misrepresenting what decent progressive politics is about to an often young and impressionable audience this is one of the reasons weve ended up with so many little nazi edgelords instead of reasonably informed young people with a clear eyed balanced view of the world its anyones right to make and distribute this stuff but on a broader societal level its leading us down a dangerous path apologies for the supplementary essay for what its worth id consider myself a moderate and find the wacky fringe sjws to be a real pr problem for the progressive movement they deserve to be mocked but the consequences of doing so are akin to pouring gasoline on a fire instead of letting itself burn out,1,292,1740,228,0.03070175438596491
cmv normalizing obesity for the sake of body positivity is dangerous,as obesity rates continue to rise ive seen more and more focus put on body positivity which as you likely know is a movement that seeks to teach people that you should be comfortable with whatever size or shape you are disagree with this movement and view it as potentially very dangerous i havent looked extensively into scientific reporting on the subject i think there very clearly can be a link between the two when thinking about it with common sense you tell an impressionable child or teenager that they should always be happy with their body regardless of what people say this will lead to them believing they should not focus on their physical health as much as they should is a dangerous mindset as normalizing obesity for the sake of positive mental health can lead to a drastic degradation in ones physical health here obesity is related to ≈1–400 000 deaths per year and costs society an estimated 117 billion in direct and indirect costs here obesity diabetes and population rates will contribute to an estimated 124 billionyr increases in the cost of kidney stones by 2030 more responsible lesson to teach would be you shouldnt feel shame in regards to your body but you do need to focus on combating obesity to the best of your ability so you dont suffer its adverse effects increased chance of heart disease medical costs etc is not a profatshaming view as i dont think anyone should be shamed for their body but promoting that everyone should always be accepting of their weight in any case is dangerous aware i havent taken into account genetic or other medicallyrelated cases of obesity  but i still think promoting a healthy lifestyle is more important than accepting your body the way it is and people in those cases should do their best to receive help from medical professionals regarding it rather than ignoring it,1,321,2056,69,0.057971014492753624
cmv trying to get people to vote regardless of how much or how little they actually know about politics is unhelpful,i get that voting is a really good thing and exercising your right to do so is a magnificent part of the freedom that we have in the west however i strongly dispute the idea that everyone should vote and that high voter turnout is always positive from the uk and our last election was my first being able to vote as was the same for pretty much all of my friends during the election i heard some of the most ridiculous reasons for voting for a candidate genuine examples include yellow is the most neutral colour desmond sounds like a rich man name and a personal favourite jo swinsons tits are bigger than my head these are all people who voted because they were told that it was their duty but didnt actually care enough to look into it we constantly see complaining about voter stupidity and identity politics so stop telling uninformed idiots who are perfectly happy staying out of it that they need to vote get that when one of your friends or family is a clean political slate that its tempting to try and convert them to follow your ideology but we just end up with a skewed idea of what people actually care about my girlfriend changed her mind on who she was voting for almost daily because various different people filled her head with crap and she ended up voting conservative because her dad owns a business and said hed cut her off if she didnt thats the level were at i deliberately avoided the discussion with her because i dont want her to vote for what i think i want her to look into it herself and come to a conclusion influencing those around you to vote for what you personally believe in just breeds a society of sheeple too lazy to research the issues before deciding who they want running the fucking country just to be clear i am not suggesting people dont vote im saying that people who clearly have no interest in policy and vote purely off of social pressure to do so should be allowed to simply abstain without stigma disagree with people and groups who parade as being impartial and merely trying to increase turnout whilst actually using it as an opportunity to campaign for their own party you should be trying to win over those who are informed and can think critically before going after nonvoters who are easier to convert,1,414,2319,118,0.03389830508474576
cmv most religions as we know them now relies on perpetual indoctrination of children who as adults understandably cannot imagine believing and living in any other way than the religion taught them,"if hypothetically for the following 15 to 20 years no one would teach any kind of religion to anybody thats the end of most western and middle eastern religion as we know it it would collapse in a matter of decades as the other generations would die off with no one to continue the legacy meanwhile all the people would have to rely on teachings of humanities  psychology sociology philosophy etc  religions have some really important values and teachings to take from them spheres where even secular humanities cannot yet reach 
but they also have excuse my language a lot of bullsht a tradition for the sake of tradition what i believe would happen is that people would pick up the corpses of the religion and pick from them what really has value and meaning to them  relying also on the teachings they would already know from humanities while adopting religious values and meanings  would give rise to value systems and meanings love justice beauty etc without the grand papa who behaves like a warlord who needs to be pleased and who punishes everybody who doesnt follow him like he wants to along with all of bullsht hurtful traditions and teachings which are all just interpretations of backwards men who hide behind devotion and love  just sad what people are willing to do just for the sake of religion and its tradition there is no other reason for cutting and sucking boys penis other than tradition there is no other reason for hating people of other sexual orientation other than tradition there is no other reason for jews and palestinians behaving like animals to each other than tradition  know what great potential religions and their teachings can have but we have to stop this awful interpretations of their teachings and start once again now with rational analysis of their material leaning on the teachings of humanities that we already have in 21st century psychology sociology philosophy  didnt survive to the 21st century because they encapsulate the best life a person can live
they survived in all their forms because they close off and shut off most of the outside secular influences while they continue to indoctrinate next generations of their followers 
rabi of ultra orthodox jews in israel said it himself  if our boys go to an army they will become more and more secular and then run away from our community well doesnt that just show on how fragile legs your teachings stand on if the boys cannot live and function with your religion in real life or even the army only in a closed of community in your little bubble of life and what you want it to be  sorry you really need to think through your teaching is just my opinion badly informed and probably not well written argument which relies on little research and mostly just impressions i just want to start a discussion would really like some man educated in theology to give his take on this problem
my point at the end is  some if not most religions need really serious reformation if not on an almost destruction of its building blocks  thought of 1520 years of ban of religion was just thought experiment",1,549,3208,202,0.019801980198019802

cmv there is a stronger case for a maximum age for us presidential eligibility than a minimum age,"the us constitution requires a candidate to be 35 years or older to be president donald trump was the oldest candidate to be elected president at age 70 and three leading candidates for the democratic nomination in 2020 joe biden bernie sanders and elizabeth warren are in their 70s with sanders the oldest being 79 on the day of the 2020 election personally lean towards there being no age restrictions beyond reaching the age of majority and i’m not even that concerned about that to run for president but i think if we’re going to accept the logic of them an upper age limit makes at least as much sense as a minimum age argument for minimum age limits is primarily that younger candidates will often be too inexperienced and immature to handle the office of president the argument for maximum age limits is primarily that older candidates have a heightened risk of death impairment andor cognitive decline think both of these are reasonable concerns but i don’t see either as being clearly worse than the other  primary argument i see against age restrictions is that “we should let the voters decide” and i think this is a powerful argument and why i lean against age restrictions and indeed other restrictions like “natural born citizenship” if voters think bernie sanders or joe biden is too old to be president they can vote for a different candidate if they think they’re still effective in spite of their age then they can vote for them that’s fine although i think this logic would apply just as well to candidates currently too young to run for president if alexandriaocasio cortez wanted to run for president in 2020 and people thought she was too young and inexperienced they could vote against her for that reason is there any case for age restrictions well i think it has to boil down to a belief that the 
“popular will” is sometimes suboptimal and can be influenced by irrationality or get stuck in some kind of bad equilibrium bryan caplan’s book the myth of the rational voter is a notable work making this kind of claim we’re accepting that logic we need to think is it more likely that these processes will lead to voters choosing a candidate who is “too young” or “too old” could make voters “irrationally” support a 34yearold for office a possible path could involve being a family member of a popular politician and then taking advantage of the “halo effect” of being betterlooking than older politicians a possible example of this has occurred with the kennedy family an entirely theoretical way this might have affected the presidency would have been if 32yearold ted kennedy had run and won the presidency in 1964 after the assassination of his brother could make voters “irrationally” support a 78yearold for office probably the main reason is having name recognition from a long career i think joe biden could be a reallife example of this sanders also has it to some degree note i’m not saying that it is necessarily irrational to support someone who has had a long career  perhaps in many cases it’s a reasonable signal of experience but i think it’s more likely than other indicators to be somewhat shallow   we look at us history and that of other countries it seems to me that the latter scenario seems a lot more common than the former the youngest president was teddy roosevelt at 42 and the youngest elected president was jfk at 43 and to my knowledge there have been no plausible majorparty nominees under the age of 35 who might have won had the age restriction not existed  note that “irrationality” doesn’t have to mean that voters are necessarily dumb they might just be facing a collective action problem for instance i believe its possible that if all voters were given the chance to reflect and then could wave a magic wand to make either joe biden or eg amy klobuchar president the majority would pick klobuchar nonetheless marginal biden voters who want a moderate candidate risk that defecting to klobuchar would instead help sanders or warren so they largely dont in a world where biden was constitutionally ineligible to run klobuchar’s campaign may have done a lot better  issue could be “futureproofing” a second term imagine for the sake of example that either biden or sanders won in 2020 then ran again in 2024 they would be 82 or 83 respectively let’s say they had some noticeable cognitive decline could we trust them to step down andor lose renominationreelection because of this maybe but maybe not after all there’s been a precedent in the senate to reelect very old incumbents most notably 93yearold sturm thurmond in south carolina in 1996 incumbent presidents almost never lose renomination and partisanship and “fundamentals” like the economy tend to matter at least as much as candidate quality in the general election it’s easy to imagine an almostsenile incumbent being penalised by voters for this but still winning then getting progressively worse over the fouryear term  i’m undecided about whether an upper age limit is a good idea i think “let the voters decide” is a reasonable argument but i think if you’re going to discount that i don’t think there’s a good case for there to only be a minimum age of 35",1,904,5668,98,0.07142857142857142

 joker has existed since the 30s and has inspired no shootings since even the colarado one had nothing to do with it movie itself in no way glorifies or justifies the alt right violent white men or the violent part of the incel community or incels in general joker as a symbol of incels and channers and the alt right thing has not been a  thing before gamersriseup and the like actually inventing the we live in a society meme linking them together and progressive click hungry clickbait outrage seeking media pushing it as a narrative if it ever comes to be it will because of them as the link did not exist before even though the character has existed throughout both the rise of the original nazis and neo nazis and even the kkks resurgence yet none of these saw fit to adopt him as a symbol even with the same group of angry white men and the far right i dont even think hitler cared about batman there was no media buzz outrage chasers pseudo activists because imo you shouldnt call yourself an activist unless your actually using your activism to do good in the world  etc this film would come and go without much more fuss than a movie like venom beyond being better received and remembered now any would be shooter has the promise that if they do this their manfeso viewpoints and everything their trying to do will be given the greatest megaphone they could ever ask for and people proptadly against them to boot their names will be immortalised and their actions and manifesto will live on in the public conscious for weeks months or even years which gives them far more motivation than just a movie about an edgy batman character if a shooting doesnt happen if joker ends up becoming an unironic chan and or incel symbol it will be because of the media and outrage chasers pushing so hard of course the far left branding this movie as dangerous and toxic and giving off jack thompson esque diatribes about the film will only make it that much enticing and fascinating to the far right and edgy channers and incels their supposedly trying to curb",1,660,3683,129,0.03875968992248062
cmv the 2 party system and the electoral college are destroying america,the 2 party system creates an us vs them mentality that is destroying our country most people immediately see someone in the opposite political party and disregard their opinion furthermore 2 parties does not create enough to encompass everyones beliefs many people agree with one party on some issues and the other party on other issues however the electoral college forces a 2 party system it is near impossible for a 3rd party to gain enough traction to succeed therefore i believe that we should abolish the electoral college and elect officials via a popular vote an argument i hear against this is that candidates wont rally in smaller states but this is not a problem thanks to the age of technology we live in smaller states can get an understanding of and form an opinon on a candidate without ever seeing them in person via the internet and television i also think we should abolish all parties and elect people purely based on their opinions this will create more options for the public and a more informed public instead of having to choose the lesser of 2 evils people can actually vote for someone they believe in in conclusion the electoral college and the 2 party system are horrible for the general public and should be abolished wow i was not expecting to get this many comments im trying to read them all but if i dont respond to your comment im sorry there are simply too many to write a well thought out response to them all i am also busy with christmas so there is that holding me back i will read them all tho,1,278,1572,73,0.0684931506849315

cmv christmas has evolved past the confines of christianity and the cultural traditions so heavily out weigh the religious traditions that everyone should feel welcome to celebrate it regardless of their religion,"my point is basically that if you look at all of the christmas traditions the santa mythos the music the trees the cookies etc they extremely out weigh the actual christianity of it and because of that we should abandon the notion that just because you celebrate christmas you also have to celebrate the birth of christ and christianity instead treating them as separate but joinable entities you can celebrate christmas with or without the christianity of it and no one should feel guilty celebrating the holiday of their religion conflicts with christian views 
 example how many christmas songs other than “away in a manger” and “silent night” do you know that actually have to do with jesus now compare that against all the songs you know about santa there’s a lot more of the later you don’t see jesus in the malls and drinking coke with polar bears on tv  though most of these traditions have pagan origins the tree the lights etc we still associate the holiday with the birth of christ instead of the actual calendar land mark the winter solstice similar to how halloween arose to celebrate the fall equinox guess my main point is that we have this big cultural holiday that is 99 cultural but because of the 1 religious part of it a lot of people feel they can’t celebrate it and they take christmas out of schools and say happy holidays and avoid it  it should be viewed  is like thanksgiving where you would never think “oh i shouldn’t celebrate thanksgiving because of my religion” and you wouldn’t hesitate to put up finger turkeys around the office pumpkins on halloween or patriotic flags on the 4th of july  religious part should be a sort of subset or an add on where should you wish to celebrate the actual birth of christ on christmas you most certainly can but if you choose to celebrate christmas without acknowledging the birth of christ that’s also equally acceptable just put up some lights and leave out cookies for santa  there are a ton of christian christmas songs that was a bad example on my part that distracted from the point ",1,371,2131,215,0.023255813953488372

cmv the “nsfw” abbreviation needs changed to become 2 different abbreviations one for nudity and one for everything else,"we’ve all seen the little red “nsfw” tag on reddit  of the time the tag works well  there is usually boobs and butts behind the click  i’m glad not to click those during my lunch break  most of us work alongside other adults so opening a creepy image or a video of a skater falling on their ass is perfectly ok to open in work  just think that the nsfw tag is too broad honestly at home i’m ok looking at your weight loss pics that maybe have a little too much flesh showing but surely it’s ok for me to show my buddy the latest pic from rcreepy on our lunch break i think there should now be 2 abbreviations  nude stuff  other  how resistant reddit are to change i’m not suggesting something like this would ever come to pass but i think it would greatly improve how reddit works  for additional reading some of your replies i see there are a few extra things to consider maybe my suggestion for improving the nsfw tag is not the best and i’m happy to read your suggestions on how it might work better  i’ve learned that there is a tag “nsfl” which is used for gore etc problem is it doesn’t get used in the right places  instance a post titled “when it goes wrong at the gym” is marked nsfw it could be anything from a guys shorts getting eaten by the treadmill to a guys knees getting snapped on the leg press  my case in point

  additional additional pointed out in the comments some people might be actively expecting some nudity when clicking a nsfw but end up with some gore etc  further proving that the nsfw tag is fundamentally broken  ",1,309,1691,123,0.056910569105691054

cmv having an obese child 10 and under should be considered child abuse,at such a young age parents play a much larger role in a child’s diet than the child does kids eat what’s in front of them and they’ll eat as much of it as you’ll let them therefore if a child is obese and doesn’t have a preexisting medical condition that may effect their weight it’s largely the parents fault and that parent is actively hurting that child not only is the child at an increased risk for countless diseases they’re far more likely to be bullied be physically uncomfortable to suffer from mental illnesses and to have an unhealthy view of their own bodies obesity can’t just be fixed by hitting the gym a few times and even if the child loses the weight there are still permanent physical impacts of having been obese as well as lasting negative habits that will forever effect the child i apologize for not being able to respond to everyone’s comments but this post blew up a lot more than i was expecting it too my view on the subject is more or less the same i have changed my stance slightly and i would like to explain how as well as clear up a few issues i have with the phrasing of my original post  i now believe that “neglect” is a more reasonable word for this scenario as “abuse” has far too strong of a connotation as well as much harsher consequences my afore mentioned cut off at the age of ten was really more a soft number and one i don’t think is appropriate nor well thought out it is now my belief that any parents of a minor are responsible for their child’s health and that an increased level of nutritional knowledge and independence in older kids doesn’t absolve their parents of responsibility it is a parent’s job to keep their child healthy regardless of their age i’m not advocating that we send cps to take kids away from their parents over their weight at most i would make it mandatory for the child and their family to speak with a nutritionist or someone who can educate them about healthier habits taking a child from their family should be avoided whenever possible and is only something i’d be in favor of if the child is in immediate danger from prolonged morbid obesity and if the parents have made no efforts to help the child lose weight in my opinion in this drastic of a situation you are effectively poisoning your own child my interest is not in punishing obese children or their families my goal is to deter parents from being complacent towards their children’s unhealthy habits and to create a world where children are properly cared for and taught healthy habits at a young age after all it’s much easier to keep a child from ever becoming obese than it is to force a child to have to lose significant amounts of weight,1,496,2752,74,0.04054054054054054

cmv the rape and incest exceptions for abortion prohibition dont make sense unless the abortion prohibition exists primarily to punish women for pregnancy or sexual activity rather than to protect the fetus,i think i managed to fit my narrow position in the title  im not interested in whether or not abortion should be legal though im prochoice if it matters but only discussing the rape and incest exceptions to abortion bans protecting the fetus is relevant because it is seen to have some inherent value that inherent value is not reduced because of how it came to be  it will still develop in time into a human being provided it doesnt miscarry like 1020 of most pregnancies if seen as a moral punishment of a woman for her misdeeds this exception makes perfect sense  a woman who willingly had sex must be forced to carry a child to term as a method of control  punishment by society unless it really isnt her fault that the sex occurred  this is much more consistent with the rapeincest exceptions willing to accept that this is about societal control over women rather than punishment and i wont take that as a change in my view though im still interested in discussion primarily im interested to see if theres any rational for that exception to an abortion ban that leaves the ban with an internally consistent philosophy that isnt about punishing or controlling women,1,213,1233,209,0.019138755980861243
cmv the age to join the united states military should be the same as the drinking and smoking age which was raised to 21 starting the summer of 2020,the argument that everyone always gives for not being able to drink at 21 is that the brain isnt fully developed yet etc but we allow these same people who cant even legally purchase a beer to go and die for us i understand that not every 18 year old that joins the military is gonna die obviously but this isnt just some high risk job the point of the military is defence and fighting yes i get that there are other positions that never see combat but that doesnt change the fact that they can see combat now im not arguing that the drinking age should be lowered or that the military age should be increased obviously one of those would have to happen if we made them the same age but im not really for one of the other as i am no expert but i cannot fathom how people think its okay to allow people to join the military but they cant even have a beer and soon they wont even be able to have a cigarette actually not sure what would change my view on this subject im not really sure what could be said to me that wood convince me that its okay to send somebody to potentially kill other people but somehow drinking a beer is more detrimental to their health or whatever other reason anybody can come up with for this law  i am open to discussion and i am certainly open to have in my view changed i keep seeing the same arguments over and over just worded differently nobody has changed my view and i have to go to work  just want to clarify that the entire point of my argument is that once the united states government views an individual as an adult they should be able to make all of these decisions by themselves if they consider 18 to be an adult they should be able to make these decisions the entire point of being considered an adult is that the government recognizes that you are able to make your own decisions and take care of yourself and provide for yourself but they dont trust you to have a drink or smoke but of course they dont mind if you join the military because that benefits them and for everyone saying that drinking harms of the people so does joining the military family sometimes dont get to see their children and loved ones for four or more years at a time not only that but if that person dies in the military the entire family is devastated it may not be the same effects as drinking and driving and killing somebody on the road but to say that the military and drinking arent the same because drinking affect other people is asinine joining the military absolutely affect other people in those around you and it has a detrimental effect on plenty of peoples mental health,1,498,2699,152,0.039473684210526314

 we rely on the thats offensive or im offended argument we just refuse any possible debate we could have with other people furthermore you have to be able to deal with these kinds of critics against your views and arguments if you want to better yourself



 good example would be neonazis i understand that the holocaust was a tragedy and that nazi germany was a mess but you simply cannot dismiss any of their views by saying theyre offensive racist etc you have to debate them and try to at least understand their point of view you can still decide they are assholes that are doing it to actively offend others or that their beliefs stem from unreliable data and misinformation but you cant do that without an honest discussion

cmv millennials have to fix the world and have every right to be angry at the older generations,"millennials have been given a huge task by older generations and the sooner they are elected to positions of power the sooner they can fix the problems that these generations have made

 in order to fix the climate millennials will have to travel less consume less and pay more for the privilege this is on top of being poorer than the generation directly above sky rocketing costs and growing inequality and then we have to pay even more tax just to keep the people who created this awful self serving system alive for a few more decades and give them spending money to deal with all this and expected to respect their elders while they write articles about how millennials are causing all the modern problems is a disgusting position especially when they have had decades to actually start fixing the issues and have instead focused on getting rich look at the ageing population issue people are living longer and because of the baby boom there are now more of them than ever these people were given really amazing retirement packages back when people died young now that governments have realised that this is unsustainable they are making pensions worse and harder to get by extending the retirement age over and over also they realise that the health care for this group is going to be massive just to have enough workers to look after them we need mass immigration but it turns out that they dont like this either so the only thing that will work is more and more public money going to health care at a higher tax rate this burden is falling on millennials when they should have upped there own taxes invested in public health care while they were earning to be ready to look after them selves when they were old  change is a massive problem and it has been known about for decades but instead of implementing massive recycling schemes and emission cutting in the 90s or even the early 2000s so it could change slowly over they pushed it back since they like consumption and now we only have 20 years to save the world which means huge and dramatic changes effecting the quality of life for the next 30 years are just 2 issues being caused by older generations but they effect how millennials will live for the rest of their lives they are clearly unwilling to change so we have to get in to power and fix this for the next generations",1,423,2386,97,0.041237113402061855

 next to impossible for it to be regulated without making it straight up illegal and parents should be able to raise their child as they see fit although it’s sill their duty to protect the kid and forcing them to pay or kicking them out is actually illegal already but having them give a small part of their earnings to a college fund or something is much different i would also say if the kid is willing to contribute or for situations where the family struggles financial that’s another good reason thanks for the discussion everybody 2  thanks for the discussions everyone was really interesting to not only see personal views but how a specific culture impacts it my original view was quite extreme and you guys have helped me to gain a more wellrounded and informed opinion on the topic and it’s very much appreciated i’m not gonna be able to respond to any more comments unless it’s groundbreaking because i didn’t honestly think that many people would discuss it have a great day everybody and thanks for helping me stay informed",1,542,2996,123,0.032520325203252036

 aspect that id like to acknowledge is that the us has several of the top universities in the world such as mit harvard yale and other ivy league schools but i think that these dont really represent the rest of the education system and dont really prove much against the points ive thought of",1,416,2483,50,0.12
cmv having no burnt popcorn is more important than popping all kernels,"i used to work at a cinema and they use pretty expensive machines that can do both but even then every once in a while someone would burn popcorn and you would literally have to put the burnt popcorn in a trash bag and walk it out of the building its not ridiculous either  burnt popcorn is not appetizing and adversely affected concession sales that a movie theater depends on of this is to say my wife will complain that i take the popcorn out too early 8 seconds left on the popcorn function on a microwave we tested for making popcorn and she doesnt like sifting through kernels but my opinion on this is youre probably not going to take the trash bag you throw the burnt popcorn into out of the house so the smell lingers
2 the kernels filter to the bottom so you dont really have a problem separating them while eating
3 theres more butter for less popcorn which is better anyway absolute worse outcome is that 98 of the popcorn is properly cooked and 2 is burnt and shell eat around the burnt popcorn so you cant escape the smell because it wasnt even thrown away its like playing russian roulette with disgusting food that sometimes isnt disgusting these reasons i think the most important part of popping popcorn is not burning the popcorn while my wife disagrees if there are some arguments i havent thought of id love to hear them because im at a complete loss for this rationality please change my view",1,260,1471,71,0.04225352112676056

cmv you shouldnt be able to see how many upvotesdown votes a comment has until after you have upvoteddownvoted,one of the most annoying things about reddit is how often comment sections turn into circlejerks echo chambers are harmful to rational discussion and should therefore be avoided it takes is five people to disagree with you for a comment to be hidden and buried which makes any comment that isnt in line with the prevailing orthodoxy effectively invisible having comments be hidden isnt necessarily a problem but what is a problem is how often comments get mass downvoted just because theyre being downvoted humans like to feel like theyre on the right side so they are extremely susceptible to group think and letting their opinions be influenced by popular trends so when someone sees a discussion where one commenter has 20 upvotes and the other has 10 downvotes they will be naturally predisposed to favour the upvoted comments the problem is of course that you dont know how many of those upvotesdownvotes were themselves people just following the trend so the issue just snowballs ive seen plenty of fairly reasonable comments get downvoted into oblivion one day and then the next day on the same sub a comment echoing the same sentiment might have hundreds of upvotes this is often a subconscious process since while we like to feel as though we are right we also like to imagine that we are rational freethinkers therefore i think a solution would be to have a comments score be hidden until you vote on it with a short time limit on altering your vote this way people would have to judge it independently and for its own merits and following the crowd would have to be an active and conscious effort rather than a passive subconscious bias i dont think many selfrespecting people would be willing to change their vote after the fact to be in line with the majority and people are more likely to stand by their own independent thoughts when they have to actively think about whether theyre letting others influence how they think,1,336,2001,115,0.034782608695652174
cmv white people can wear cornrows,when my sister totally white was 14 she went to summer camp with cornrows in her hair she chose to do this hairstyle because her hair is very long and extremely frizzy and curly and she didnt want to have to deal with taking care of it about a week into camp she was called out by a white camper for appropriating africanamerican culture and forced to take out the cornrows by a white counselor she described the whole situation as somewhat traumatic people calling her racist etc i think this is an unjust violation of her freedom of expression the idea that cornrows are cultural appropriation began after white celebrities wore cornrows and were described as exciting new and edgy by the media black women were justifiably shocked by this after all they had been wearing cornrows for generations but the problem here wasnt that white women were wearing cornrows rather it was the medias reaction that was the problem this cultural appropriation idea needs to be treated differently and should never be extended to people like my sister who was wearing cornrows for the same reason black people do because theyre functional for frizzy hair i encourage you to read my sister’s response which i commented in a reply to the comment where i awarded the delta,1,219,1307,35,0.11428571428571428

cmv basic cpr and first aid training and practice should be a mandatory part of high school curriculums nationwide,given the million and one utterly useless things that they teach throughout our education i think the fact that basic lifesaving skills arent taught there is inexcusable like a high school could spend a hundred hours drilling you on memorizing dates that have little to no practical application in real life but theyre not going to teach you what to do if someone stops breathing or gets a huge cut or a back injury  i think students should be trained and certified in cprfirst aid early in their freshman year drilled periodically and recertified as necessary throughout the remainder of their time in high school this would probably take a grand total of 1015hrs over the course of their whole four years of high school considering that students spend 28004000hrs in high school anyways and huge swaths of that time is spent having them memorize and regurgitate information that for 98 of them has no practical real life application spending a tiny fraction of that time teaching them some basic skills needed to keep people alive or at very least not make medical emergencies worse seems well worth it and i dont know why its not already required learning,1,200,1187,116,0.0603448275862069
cmv people shouldn’t be judged by something they did 35 years ago people can change,"there have been a number of instances recently where people have behaved poorly many years ago and have been crucified in the media  where they have thought to have committed a crime then they should be innocent until proven guilty  a case can be brought forward and tested in a court someone has done something considered objectionable in today’s society like wear blackface or said something offensive i believe they shouldn’t be judged by today’s standards  i also think people can grow as a person  you can’t judge a 55 year old by their actions as a 20 year old  thanks everyone for giving me plenty to think about and i think my view has been changed somewhat  i was excluding illegal acts from this post and only talking about statements or poor taste actions think the key points i’ve taken that i now agree with are

cmv anything can and should be joked about in the right context,i believe that in the right context anything can and should be joked about to say that some topics must never be made light of gives too much power to those things for example joking about the holocaust while not always situationally appropriate helps us process the tragedy and reinforces that we won and that we aren’t letting nazis hold that power over us any more to say it’s never okay to joke about it is to give them and the event power over us while making a joke out of it is the ultimate insult to nazis and hitler essentially making a joke out of serious topics gives us power and takes away the negative power of those serious topics  i’m not saying you should always tell jokes about serious topics don’t make holocaust jokes with a survivor unless they make it clear they’re okay with it don’t make dead baby jokes around someone who miscarried unless they make it clear they’re okay with it  however if someone tries to be offended on the behalf of others but has no actual personal ties to the topic then joke away in that case the offended party is in the wrong  as long as there’s either nobody with a personal connection to a serious topic or those with the connection give the okay anything can be joked about telling jokes about serious topics helps us cope and takes away the negative power of those topics ,1,248,1366,64,0.046875
cmv access to cars has become ubiquitous and because of that and safe driving not being a priorityenforced many people dont take the responsibility seriously leading to entitlement dangerous driving and fatalities,"edit this has been super fun and had some really great conversations but im tired its my day off and i did this instead of laundry so i will probably not be replying any more i have given a delta because of this comment and have messaged the mods to make sure it goes through i also want to shout out this comment i might check in in a couple days to see if anything else pops up thanks all stay safe at bottom its the title context  i live in atlantic canada used to love driving couldnt afford a car when i moved out exclusively bicycled instead for the last several years recently got a good job so got a carshare and have been very surprised by how shitty driving is now that im an adult got my license at 16 and in retrospect i am horrified that anyone let me behind the wheel at that age the written test was a onepage piece of cake the driving test was brief and didnt cover anything difficult like parallel parking merging on the highway finding the turning lane etc  it boiled down to seeing if i knew what a flashing green was and whether i remembered to check my mirrors its been a decade and i have not yet been required to take another driving or written test  even if several of the local laws regarding driving have been altered driver training isnt even mandatory  if you pay 600 you can take your easy tests and walk out with a license to drive after doing it exactly one time city has had a string of pedcar and bikecar collisions over the last few years and so im seeing have many other places so many people have died or been seriously hurt and its being treated as a fact of life comments in the articles blame the victim as if the driver was inconvenienced in any way besides having to fix a dent i dont know the exact circumstances of these collisions but two humans colliding at 5kmh or even two bikes colliding at 20kmh is obviously a lot less serious than anything colliding with a car i dont think enough drivers are aware of the incredible responsibility you have when piloting a very heavy very fast machine and arent aware enough of the risks of not taking it seriously im seeing a lot of fatalities for pedestrians wearing dark clothes walking at night and this is often framed as their fault  when in reality doesnt it make more sense for the person driving the vehicle to drive slowly enough to be able to stop in time in lowlight conditions like nightime if theyre in the city shouldnt they slow at every intersection assuming an unseen person is there why is the onus on the pedestrian to own and remember to bring a safety vest or white tshirt each time they have to get somewhere after dark as car drivers we get the benefit of fast convenient travel  at the price of the responsibility of not hurting anyone i know in many situations the pedbike was clearly at fault this post is about the rest of the collisions ideas reduced speed limits in cities from 50kmh to more like 30 so people have more time to see and react to situations unfolding ahead and around them with stop signs and lights i cant imagine metro driving times would get significantly higher

cmv the claim that a man is mansplaining is a convenient and sexist way for women to silence debate instead of addressing the mans arguments,"im willing to acknowledge that women and men are treated differently in professional and social contexts i dont have any data on hand to back this up but i wouldnt dispute that all else being equal men are expected to be more assertive and may garner more attention when speaking up than women this social phenomenon which probably exists it is intellectually dishonest lazy and frankly insulting for women to disregard the opinions of men by playing the mansplaining card  individual whether male or female has their own personal experiences and knowledge that others do not have if a man happens to know more than a woman about a given subject and shares his knowledge with her is he suddenly doing something reprehensible i certainly would not condemn a woman for explaining something to a man so why should the reverse be problematic might counter my argument by stating that mansplaining requires more than a man simply explaining something to a woman sure id be willing to admit this per wikipedia mansplaining means to explain something to someone characteristically by a man to woman in a manner regarded as condescending or patronizing problem with using this term is that whether or not a person is being condescending or patronizing is entirely subjective a given woman might feel that a given man is condescending even though he may be in good faith and with no intention of coming across that way this man may not even explain things differently to women than he does to men course some men do treat women with greater condescension than they do men however even when this is the case it is sexist to use the term mansplaining to characterize his behaviour the problem with this term is the chilling effect that could ensue if men now risk being condemned for explaining things to women whether or not they are doing so in a condescending manner these men will simply avoid explaining things to women altogether think that sharing information and knowledge is something that should be fostered and valued this certainly means that the opinions of women should be valued too we should not attempt to silence and prevent men from sharing their insights with women instead both men and women should encourage women to share their own insights and make greater efforts to value what women share when they speak short i think the term mansplaining is a juvenile way to compensate for social injustices by indiscriminately attacking all men without attempting to resolve the core of the issue ultimately using this term needlessly provokes hostility and does nothing to encourage people to listen to women more  the definition of mansplaining i see a lot of users claiming that mansplaining has one definition namely that the man must be condescending with a woman who knows as much or more than the man about the subject matter in question these users claim that this is the correct definition of the term and that the definition i have provided a man being condescending or patronizing when explaining something to a woman is an incorrect definition i cant say that i agree with this distinction i gather that the term mansplaining is relatively new slang according to googletrends the term originated in february 2008 the term has since been frequently used in situations covered by both the correct and incorrect definitions i submit that this usage is what informs the definition since it is how the term is commonly understood there is no reason to preclude one definition or the other this point i still feel that its use in either context is sexist even if the term is supposed to apply only in the correct definition situations using the term in those situations will only make its use in both correct and incorrect situations more widespread the term is itself open to interpretation and sounds to any objective male or female listener like a reproach of maletofemale explanations perceived to be condescending

cmv hand washing facilities should be placed outside of bathrooms rather than inside,washing your hands after going to the toilet is obviously a good thing to do the problem as i see it is that this relies on everyone washing their hands which we know isn’t the case if there is an inward opening door you have to make contact with the handle which is touched by everyone else  unless the stalls are completely sealed it seems that fecal particles can disperse through a room meaning that the tapsfaucets and any other surfaces are compromised  makes more sense to me that we wash our hands once we leave the bathroom so that we sanitise once we no longer have to contact shared handles or objects that share a space with toilets it would incentivise the nonwashers to wash because it’s more likely the handle will be compromised if no one has washed their hands before exit  ideal solution in my opinion would be to have hand washing facilities both inside and out as we may also use the sinks and mirrors inside the bathroom to shave apply make up and have the option to double wash  struggling to find any downside outside of the financial and architectural inconvenience i don’t really think they are significant enough to prohibit this as we accept these for other things when the inconvenience is outweighed by the benefit  my view,1,229,1305,86,0.046511627906976744
cmv voting day in the usa should be a national holiday,"i know this wont fix everything and id even accept it being on a saturday but can anyone explain to me the true detriment to making the first tuesday after november 1st a national holiday i ask sincerely  aware of the theories on why this isnt the case but im curiouswhy is making this a national holiday a bad thing i know not every company will recognize the holiday and close their doors but it has to be better than nothing right  in mind im not suggesting we force businesses to close up shop to allow their employees to vote but is the fear or concern related to this idea grounded in money like not enough resources to manage voting polls hourly workers not making money etc had to bail early yesterday before i could get back to a lot of comments but it seems to be an interesting debate among many users here i appreciate the responses i genuinely submitted this post because i was curious about what the naysayers were thinking i am no voting expert nor an economist  but it seems the biggest drawback or argument against making voting day a national holiday is a lack of faith in the voting public or the damage it could do
either the economy hourly workers or small businesses  for one do not want to completely ignore these concerns i see them as valid but i still feel we need to make it easier to vote or at least try something new be it a week of voting voting polls open on weekends or making it a national holiday i know many states have different rules and regulations when it comes to voting  and this doesnt even take into account all the local and municipal referendums that fly in under the radar but i think it would do this country some good if we could figure out a way to encourage more voter turnout just my two cents

 not all black people are american i would assume that a black person from another country would feel a little strange to be called aa thus calling someone aa is just another convenient way of profiling the word black has a history associated with discrimination even that i still think its a better term than aa because of the point about american maybe black people appreciate that nonblack people make the effort to try and address them with a term that are perceived as more respectful i just think that avoiding the word black while accepting the word white is a step backward from equality",1,160,948,74,0.08108108108108109

cmv neo gender identities such as nonbinary and genderfluid are contrived and do not hold any coherent meaning,"edit 3 yeah this has pretty much run its course now and im going to leave it here i just wanted to do this last note at the top to summarise my thoughts at this point

  some people like me in the opening post define gender or gender identity as inherently of the relation between your physical sex and perception of self one thing ive gained from comments here is that what i might class as dysphoria isnt as simple as i had thought and some people have explained identifying as nonbinary or something other than malefemale in degrees of dysphoria or different types of it which i hadnt considered or been aware of so thats helped my understanding of those terms from that angle
  other people define and relate to gender strictly in terms of culture social expectations and their relation to the world around them they identify in nonbinary terms because of how they deviate from or feel those norms dont apply to them im still a little jury out in my mind on whether i would personally class that as a gender identity but its certainly been insightful in how these terms can be valid simply insofar as not everyone means the same thing when they talk about gender
  another thing that came from the above was numerous contributors made reference to other cultures which include genders besides male and female in some form to be honest without being an expert on each and every one of those cultures i cant really say to what extent thats relevant in the application of gender and gender identity in modern western culture and society i certainly take the point that it underscores how conceptions of gender can vary depending on when and where you are but that there may be other cultures which recognise three four or a million genders isnt really a point of contention to me or what i was asking people to change my view on because i was specifically asking about how people use those terms here and todayi mean unless youre saying what you mean when you identify as nonbinary is the same thing the navajo tribe mean by twospirit so i should read up on that im just not sure it really tells me much
  yes i still believe there are snowflakes in the world people for whom these labels are nothing more than a teenage fad or a way of claiming victimhood but i have also learned that assuming anyone using terms like nonbinary genderfluid femme etc falls in to this attentionseeking category is indeed a deep misconception on my part i was actually surprised at how little resentment anger offence or reactionary calling me a nazi took place for asking these questions in what i expected to be an extremely touchy subject i mean it did happen but it was very few people but it is one i wanted to explore and understand better the overwhelming majority of you were very friendly sincere and i got a lot of positive understanding and human engagement out of it very grateful to you for that
  my biggest outstanding question or thought on this is i still wonder to what extent the ever growing vocabulary around not just gender but broader identity is actually helpful as sociopolitical discourse i guess i think when you develop these increasingly specialised and numerous terms for identity characteristics whether intentional or not you run the risk of further dividing and segregating people boxing in their personalities to arbitrary labels and even pitting them against each in competition for recognition and resources and yet that seems like the opposite of what you would want to happen so yeah well i wouldnt blanket dismiss identity politics and advocacy based around identity as universally a bad thing i think it comes with a lot of caveats and is something you should do with caution to all who took part
gender identity in the mainstream until a few years ago was defined exclusively in terms of male and female the gender binary we also obviously had awareness of transgender people who experience body dysphoria an innate sense they were born as the wrong sex and in many cases take steps to live and present as the sex they believe they should be there are also a very small proportion of people who are clinically intersex which depending on what form and to what degree may or may not impact whether they can be distinctly classified as male or female of the above is a controversial change my view thing for me the existence of trans people and intersex people is self evident as is that they do not necessarily fit the distinctly male or female gender identity in which the vast majority of people fall recently however we have seen the widespread adoption in mainstream discourse of ideas like nonbinary genderfluid gender is a spectrum etc or even that you dont need dysphoria to be trans this last one is especially bizarre to me as i would say being transgender by definition requires you to experience body dysphoria i do not get to me it seems like contrived attention seeking either it does not really mean anything coherent or when people who espouse these views are referring to gender and gender identity they mean something totally different by those terms than i do example if i were to say my gender identity is male what i mean by that is the combination of the following two things i am physically biologically male and have the corresponding physical traits to that sex there is no disconnect between my body and sense of self no part of my body or its maleness feels wrong or like it doesnt belong to me as a self aware being trans person would say there is a disconnect between their bodily traits and sense of self a nonbinary person who is not intersex and distinctly physically classifiable as either male or female expressing when they say they do not feel male or female gender to me in that context is the relation of your physical sex to your identity so i dont see how its possible to have something in between only answers i have ever seen make reference to tastes personal preferences things i would regard as personality rather than gender i for example reject that not being a walking one dimensional 1950s stereotype of your sex somehow amounts to holding a different gender identity nor do i see how that is even coherent as a concept youre a young boy who likes baking cupcakes and playing with barbie dolls that makes you a boy who likes baking cupcakes and playing with barbie dolls thats all youre a teenage girl who likes cutting your hair short putting on a hoodie and skateboarding great whats that got to do with anything wed refer to as your gender thats my change my view  explain to me what it means to say your gender identity is fluid non binary or whatever other neologism has been coined for it and how this is not just either a conflation of gender with personality or a bandwagon to claim a marginalised identity by people who are entirely ordinary huge thank you to everyone whos contributed its getting to a point now i cant keep up with or respond to all the answers ill keep reading what comes in but im going to have to largely drop out of replying at this point perhaps save the odd thing which particularly piques my interest 2 again thank you everyone some of the answers in this thread have been qualitative useful and given me a better and wider understanding of these gender identities and gender issues its very clear that many people have many different conceptions and views of what gender is how it relates to ourselves as individuals and the constituency of culture and society while i do still believe there are people out there who coopt certain labels and identities essentially as a form of attention seeking without any substance to it it is also clear that to many other people these identities have real significant meanings which speak to them in a way binary gender doesnt and which have been insightfully explained to that extent this post has been successful in changing my view and giving me a better understanding of other peoples perceptions and experiences want to finish by addressing one last point there have been a few accusations that the title and body of my post was rude insulting or disrespectful i wont apologise for incidentally offending anyone when that wasnt my intention but i will tell you that wasnt my intention i do my best day to day in my life to be empathetic to understand people to learn to grow to challenge myself my own judgements and perceptions by actively seeking out those of others which may be different and to reserve the right to unapologetically change my mind at any time new information or perspective convinces me i was wrong thats what i was trying to do here theres no point approaching that by holding back or being dishonest about what im

cmv people incarcerated for marijuana related crimes in states where marijuana is now legal should be released,there are many people who are currently incarcerated due to marijuana related crimes in states where marijuana is now legal it doesnt seem fair to them to continue to imprison them since the crimes they are being punished for are not longer considered crimes if they had committed the act that led to their imprisonment after legalization they would not be in prison although they committed their crimes while marijuana was still illegal if the legislature felt that this type of act should no longer be considered illegal all those who are in prison should also be released because the acts that they are being imprisoned for are no longer considered crimes  would help decompress an already overburdened prison system and seems fair to those who have been incarcerated for things that are no longer even considered crimes  could argue that although it is legal now when the act was committed it was considered illegal and so the punishment should be based on whatever the law was at the time this argument seems untenable because despite the act being committed at a time that it was deemed to be illegal times change and sometimes the legislaturejudiciary determines that certain laws were incorrect to begin with as an example if before 1967 someone was imprisoned for being in an interracial marriage once the supreme court deemed these kind of laws to be unconstitutional it would be reasonable to release anyone imprisoned for such an act arguing that they should be kept in prison because interracial marriage was illegal when they got married would seem a very odd argument to make this doesnt match the values of the society as it is now and therefore these people should not remain imprisoned,1,291,1737,112,0.03571428571428571
cmv in heterosexual relationships the problem isnt usually women being nags its men not performing emotional labor,its a common conception that when you marry a woman she nags and nitpicks you and expects you to change but i dont think thats true think in the vast majority of situations there are definitely exceptions women are asking their partners to put in the planning work for shared responsibilities and men are characterising this as being a nag seen this in younger relationships where women will ask their partners to open up to them but their partners wont be willing to put the emotional work in instead preferring to ignore that stuff one example is with presents with a lot of my friends ive seen women put in a lot of time effort energy and money into finding presents for their partners whereas ive often seen men who seem to ponder what on earth their girlfriend could want without ever attempting to find out think this can often extend to older relationships where things like chores child care or cooking require women to guide men through it instead of doing it without being asked in my opinion this shouldnt be required in a longterm relationship between two adults i know a lot of people will just say these guys are jerks now im a lesbian so i dont have first hand experience but from what ive seen from friends colleagues families and the media this is at least the case in a lot of peoples relationships  hi everyone this thread has honestly been an enlightening experience for me and im incredibly grateful for everyone who commented in this and the askmen thread before it got locked i have taken away so much but the main sentiment is that someone else always being allowed to be the emotional partner in the relationship and resenting or being unkind or unsupportive about your own emotions is in fact emotional labor or something the concept of emotional labor has been disputed really well but im just using it as shorthand also that men dont have articles or thinkpieces to talk about this stuff because theyre overwhelmingly taught to not express it these two threads have changed so much about how i feel in day to day life and im really grateful however i do have to go to work now so though ill still be reading consider the delta awarding portion closed 2 im really interested in writing an article for medium or something about this now as i think it needs to be out there feel free to message any suggestions or inclusions and ill try to reply to everyone 3 there was a fantastic comment in one of the threads which involved different articles that people had written including a this american life podcast that i really wanted to get to but lost can anyone link it or message me it,1,472,2723,119,0.03361344537815126
cmv anyone working a fulltime job should be paid enough to support themselves,"so for me the above held opinion is straightforward common sense what this means is that a person should be able to afford a mortgage food water clothing and anything else which would otherwise put them below the poverty line eg internet connection and electricity working only what we as society have defined as a single fulltime job typically between 4548 hours a week  
 why is this a cmv well ive heard several people mutter that they think that someone working in service industry as a waiter or fastfood cook should not be entitled to that sort of life people view these often as student jobs or unskilled as if that makes them somehow undeserving in comparison to their family person job several organisations exist that measure the living wage  how much money people need to afford the basics depending on their area recently the conservatives in the uk have rebranded the minimum wage as a living wage however they left it at a much lower rate than the independent organisations have judged to be the true living wage  
 find this shocking but ive heard people say that this is government interference and nanny stating to even provide this much with people saying things like oh if they wanted to be paid more then they should get a better job  
 biggest problem is that what effectively happens is that businesses that are pretty much on the border of failing are having their enterprise shored up by working tax credits or benefits paid in lieu of that business actually paying its staff  basically the business doesnt have to be successful because it exploits its workers to the point that despite not being profitable enough it still maintains operations rather than going to the wall i feel like this is the business shirking its social responsibility on to the tax payers who dont benefit directly from that business success where am i wrong am i a bleeding heart liberal or have i made a grave misconception is the only counterargument here just that we dont enforce a minimum wage at all",1,357,2092,80,0.05
cmv diamonds are a boring gem and should not be as valuable,"i fancy gems i sub to many gem and mineral subreddits and i think a natural gemstone can be a beautiful earthly treasure i dont like the jewelry worlds fixation with diamonds among gems non is as commercial as diamonds but i just cant help but feel that its taking the soul out of the gem making it a sparkly rock and thats it are some reasons why i dislike diamonds  the chase for perfection when the goal is a super clear stone it makes stones indistinguishable arent that rare but they are controlled by diamond companies so the market doesnt saturate this is why they trying so hard to fight lab made diamonds 
that beat them in the game of clearness 


 usually diamonds are colorless and its boring some stones have insane natural colors and i think thats way more interesting with the right cut stones can become just wow examples of stones i think are just wow are amazing in the sense that each one is unique with distinct color play come in all colors and some even have an effect called a star a naturally occuring 6 point star optical illusion more stones have that unique character that make each stone unique diamonds are marketed really hard that diamonds arent as boring  so some people did change my mind about diamonds being boring their chemical structure is indeed very unique the political drama around diamonds from blood diamonds to them being used as a black market currency and a way to launder money is definitely not boring was generally really happy how big this topic got and that people are so opinionated about gems",1,280,1676,61,0.06557377049180328
cmv a blown break light or tail light is not a reasonable suspicioncause for a traffic stop by a law enforcement officer,for too long law enforcement officers have been authorized to initiate a traffic stop due to a blown brake light or tail light this is impermissible for the following reasons a blown brake light or tail light is nearly impossible for a driver to have knowledge of before driving especially when traveling alone proven by taking a drivers exam at the dmv where the presence of a dmv employee is required to check brake lightstail lights prior to the exam and entering the road as one cannot physically see the rear end of their vehicle even worse a brake light or tail light can blow during operation of the vehicle  there is no sufficient way for a law enforcement officer to show that a brake light is actually blown other than having the driver move to the back of the vehicle and have the law enforcement officer enter the vehicle to press the break pedal which is highly unlikely to happen due to officer safety concerns it allows for discriminatory and stereotypical pretextual stops based off of race ethnicity low socioeconomic status religion sex and disability it often is and leads to an abuse of power by law enforcement officers a law enforcement officer must be required to take down the make model and license plate of the car in order for an agency such as the dmv to send out a letter by mail or email to notify the registered owners of the blown brake light or tail light they could also be required to telephone the registered owners to speak with them at a later time or leave a voicemail if still driving not only will this lessen discrimination stereotyping and abuse of powers by law enforcement officers it will allow resources to be utilized for necessary and more important crime it also comes down to discretion of the officer not all situations require a traffic stop while some very well might snowstorms both tail lights blown dual functioning tail lights and blinkers etc could also be applied to a blown headlight however a blown headlight is a bit easier to identify by the driver for instance at nighttime it can be noticeable to a driver or it can be noticeable in the reflection of a vehicle traveling ahead of the driver anyone else have thoughts or opinions on this matter,1,394,2302,123,0.032520325203252036
cmv todays fbi press conference shows without question that hillary clinton is above the law and is not being held to the same standards as less connected powerful and rich americans would be,todays fbi press conference explicitly states among other things that hillary clinton would not be charged with a criminal offence because she was not aware she was breaking the law awareness of the law is not generally required to convict someone from a crime and the only reason she has gotten away with it is because she is too powerful and well connected for members of law enforcement to risk their careers going after her on top of this her position in government would have explicitly made her aware of the seriousness of these offences and the consequences of not respecting the sensitive nature of the information she had access to finally a lesser employee who committed these acts would be fired and never work in government again for such obvious mishandling of this information therefore it is my opinion that hilary clinton has very clearly today been shown to be not subject to the same regulations as a less well connected powerful and rich american and by extension the citizens of america do not live in a nation where rule of law can be expected to protect the common man from government corruption hello users of cmv this is a footnote from your moderators wed just like to remind you of a couple of things firstly please remember to read through our rules if you see a comment that has broken one it is more effective to report it than downvote it speaking of which downvotes dont change views if you are thinking about submitting a cmv yourself please have a look through our popular topics wiki first any questions or concerns feel free to message us happy cmving,1,280,1912,195,0.05128205128205128
cmv the normalisation of social anxiety is breeding social anxiety,edit i must clarify that i do not believe this is the only cause of the rise in anxiety obviously as with almost every issue faced by the world there are many factors that affect global mental health start i have ocd and panic disorder i do not suffer from anxiety however i’d say i understand feeling anxious and suffering from a mental illness more than the average neurotypical person i’m not trying to ridicule anyone with social anxiety or any forms of anxiety disorder i am not saying that normalisation is inherently bad anxiety is a very real very valid mental illness people would most certainly still suffer from social anxiety regardless of if we had a label for it if people were vocal about their experiences  i believe there is a reason social anxiety seems to be the most common form of anxiety particularly in the current rising generations we talk about it nonstop social anxiety has been normalised to the point where it’s considered ‘not relatable’ if you don’t have it   out any form of social media and you will find comments making jokes about how they’re ‘too scared to order food’ or ‘too scared to answer calls’  youtube skits instagram memes tweets and such are centred around this it has become embedded into the culture i would like to state social media at this point for this rising generation 1625 is clearly a given for each individual person to have and use to communicate effectively therefor it is not a sampling of only introvertedanxious people but the general population  believe the constant rehashing of social anxiety and the issues associated with it are bringing unfounded fears to the forefront of people’s minds they hear flocks of people say things such as “i’m too scared to order my food what if the waiter judges me” amp they in turn think “oh i’ve never thought of that will the waiter judge me should i be thinking about that” and rinse amp repeat with several social anxiety issues until these fears are imbedded in the whole populous has to be a reason that social anxiety seems to be growing so rapidly when other forms of anxiety are not to me it seems clear that is due to the normalisation of it suffer from panic attacks over a fear of being killed among many other things the fear of terrorism planes and general apocalypse level things is a common trigger for me i logically understand these are unfounded fears when i hear a particularly loud plane overhead and start freaking out i remind myself of this that it is my mental illness causing this fear that i am not in danger it’s just an imbalance of chemicals in my brain bla bla bla and instruct others to do so as well if they wish to help me it doesn’t always stop a panic attack but it certainly seems to shorten them or give me a sense of hope that they will be over soon it’s just my brain messing up someone is socially anxious there’s seems to be a culture of ‘understanding’ their anxiety like it is integral to make them feel supported and understood one must say “i understand why you might feel this way it is very scary to talk to the person at the cash register i’m here for you” or alternatively “i’ll do it for you” this seems like it almost takes their fears and in some way makes them reality for everyone around them like instead of blaming social anxiety on an illness it’s an accepted response to the world we live in it seems like this normalisation of the response to anxiety could be making these fears seem logical in the minds of people who otherwise wouldn’t of thought to fear some forms of socialisation want to make it clear i am not saying we shouldn’t comfort people with social anxiety or do any of the above i am not saying we should treat people with social anxiety that way that helps me i suffer with a different illness i am a different person things are different  am simply saying the reason the way we handle social anxiety right now is making it more likely for other people to develop the illness because it’s embedding it into our culture as a norm instead of as a serious illness that needs assistance i think this could cause a lot of troubles in even neurotypical people and could be changing the scape of what is a ‘normal’ fear  there is no other way to handle social anxiety maybe there is i’m no expert  just think neurotypical people should be on the look out to remember social anxiety is an illness and the worries of the mentally ill don’t have to be adopted by you work hard to resist the temptation that fear has on all of us i suppose  do you think social anxiety rates are stagnant maybe this is all anecdotal evidence change my view wording ‘growing’ ‘stagnant’ ocd is not a form of anxiety as of 2014 as per the dsm please stop telling me it is in the comments regardless i was referring to gad generalised anxiety disorder which is widely recognised as manifesting completely differently to ocd even before they separated ocd and anxiety officially i think i’ve slight changed my view i don’t believe it’s the normalisation of the illness that cause it’s growth more likely the normalisation of unhealthy coping mechanisms avoiding socialisation etc that has spread to people who otherwise wouldn’t of found it socially acceptable to indulge in those behaviours i don’t think social anxiety is treated enough as a serious debilitating illness like depression and ocd are so people refrain from highlighting how absolutely dangerous it is to use those unhealthy coping mechanisms instead we just get memes about being to scared to answer the phone imagine if we were to get similar memes about cutting it would be a stark difference that’s not to say there’s anything wrong with joking about mental illness i think it’s important but it’s only a viable option if it is first taken seriously which social anxiety is not i’d like social anxiety similar to agoraphobia which is taken much more seriously but no one sees the avoidance of ever leaving the house as something to joke about instead of help someone get over,1,1082,6221,67,0.05970149253731343

cmv we should abolish the penny,there are a lot of reasons pennies are problematic they cost around 2 cents to mint which costs the government 90 million a year they are an environmental hazard due to their zinc content they are poisonous to pets  the most damning feature of pennies is that the monetary value of a penny no longer covers the extra time spent on the transaction the average hourly wage in the us is 2832 at that rate you earn a penny every 13 seconds even at a rather low wage of 12 an hour you still make a penny within 3 seconds now imagine youre digging for a penny in your wallet or purse that could easily take three seconds but don’t forget that the cashier is waiting for you fumbling through your wallet between the two of you thats six seconds now imagine youre with your spouse and there is a couple waiting in line between all five people you fumbling for that penny has wasted all of 15 seconds based on the average hourly income that comes out to almost 12 cents worth of time wasted for the sake of one cent note i’ve been a cashier and i’ve waited full three minutes at a stretch for people to find and count their pennies  put the penny no longer serves its  basic purpose as a method to store and transfer wealth we should get rid of it and round to the nearest nickel at the register  i missing some value provided by the penny,1,258,1437,32,0.15625
cmv employers that make no effort to retain employees through promotions raises etc have no room to complain about turnover,"my last employer was a shitshow they relied a lot on temporary agency associates to help get the workload done whiles it no secret that temp workers have a high turnover even the permanent employees left really quickly as well all told the turnover rate at my last employer was in the triple digits was a permanent employee of this company for a year before leaving for a much better job when the hr manager found out i was leaving she sighed and asked why are all of my good people leaving i wanted to smack her right then and there why because months earlier before i had received this job offer i was discussing my dissatisfaction with this same hr manager and she sighed wistfully and said i dont know what to do we dont really have a lot of opportunities for people to move up company paid its permanent employees 1112 per hour there were never any raises and few opportunities to advance and even when higherlevel opportunities did come up they were always hired from outside ive since come to realize that far too many employers are like this only real benefit offered to employees at this company seemed to be a tuition assistance program however it didnt come with any kind of promise that the education it supported could be used in the company which basically meant the company was taking money and setting fire to it suppose i need to get to my point now if you are an employer and you want dedicated employees you need to offer some combination of the following for employees to get trained in different roles especially ones that are betterpaying
regular raises
stock options
valuable compensation plans im sure im going to hear someone say what if an employer cant afford all of that if an employer cant invest in their employees then id wonder why theyre hiring in the first place but at a minimum regardless of their financial status if they refuse to invest in their workers they dont have room to complain about high turnover",1,347,2044,130,0.03076923076923077

 believe this will not be truly in the best interest for gay or lesbian students for a variety of reasons if i were gay and growing up in a deeply homophobic environment as student under the age of 16 i cant see how this would be to my benefit   completely understandable with the desire to have a safe environment for gay students but is this not actually yielding to homophobic attitudes instead of tackling bullying culture gay students are effectively segregated from other students for a time the bullies got what they wanted and when the bullies grow up and enter the workforce they are only likely to ever carry over their prejudices and discriminatory attitudes they need to be told that this isnt acceptable and people of different sexualities arent others but their own peers as well even though enrolment is purely voluntarily and temporarily we should be concentrating on integration rather than enforcing our social differences and stamping out intolerance  the example given as justification for the school the case of a 14 yearold girl from a christian family who killed herself over guilt of being attracted to women elizabeth lowe was afraid of coming out to her parents and friends it is not clear how exactly if this school existed would it made it any easier for her to come out to her family if a gay student cant admit this part of their life to their parents how can they be able to ask to be enrolled in that school ive known plenty of lgbtq people they arent immune from having deeply homophobic attitudes themselves it is a view also held by some gay people that bisexuality is simply indecisiveness that queer is a buzzword and transsexuality isnt necessarily wholly accepted by all either there are preconceptions and ideals as to how a gay man should act like and expectations for lesbians from other lesbians as well lipstick lesbian dykes etc if the objective was to take sexuality out of the classroom i can only see this as failing because they cant ensure freedom from discrimination even between themselves  mistakes or anything i am not clear on in my post let me know i will bold any edits thank you 1 minor grammar  2 cleared up some bad writing in my post thank you for your responses so far  3 no longer convinced point 2 is a good argument hello users of cmv this is a footnote from your moderators wed just like to remind you of a couple of things firstly please remember to read through our rules if you see a comment that has broken one it is more effective to report it than downvote it speaking of which downvotes dont change views if you are thinking about submitting a cmv yourself please have a look through our popular topics wiki first any questions or concerns feel free to message us happy cmving",1,548,3884,138,0.050724637681159424

   i am amazed at the number of bloggers and even newspaper explaining summarizing facts they gathered without giving the reader any chance to confirm it by himself i think it is deceptive and extremely dangerous as it helps rumors and fake news spread in famous newspapers there are several instances where instead of original sources there are  just links leading to other newspaper articles so you have to trust that because it appears in a famous newspaper it must be true even though these newspaper are doing incredible work and are probably 99 accurate it also incites the public not to dig deeper and this is that very inertia and lack of education that makes such a fertile soil for gossip and misinformation to develop is why i think this should be made illegal and considered as a minor offense",1,265,1508,82,0.04878048780487805
cmv electoralparty funding should be exclusively public big private donations shouldnt be allowed,"ill start by saying that regardless of what country youre from democracy is or should be your most valued principle if it is your most important principle it should be fair and you should protect it at all costs  we also live in a society where money talks the biggest parties have the most money this is pretty much an universal rule at all countries  fundingdonations my biggest issue being corporate funding or millionaire donations by a single person im ok with your average citizen donating 5 10  15 bucks or whatever to whoever he wants to support lets all agree that isnt the same thing as millionares donating 5 10 or 15 million dollars leads to elected oficials owing favors to the ones who donated this makes their donation being pretty much an exchange or just legal bribery you donating 15 bucks however wouldnt be the caseany leftover funds from donations well make them go into the next elections fund 
 as to what i believe is the actual polemic view remove the party funds each election recognized parties no you and 5 friends cant just create a party and receive this funding will receive the same amount of funding i dont have numbers but if it turns out high so be it democracy should be protected 
this would make it easier for smaller parties with different opinions to reach more people and in turn get more votes also would make it harder for parties like the republicans or democrats to get votes simply for being blue or red ever wondered how an election with smaller parties having an actual shot this would make a better democracy as more views could be exposed for voting making it more diverse and representative

cmv the war on drugs is one of the worlds worst policy decisions does more harm than good and is ultimately pointless,i know its not a controversial opinion but i want to see the other sides point of view war on drugs is one of the worst policy decisions in the countries that enforce them has led to a myriad of problems for society and is in direct opposition to the fundamental idea of liberty and the right to individual selfdetermination these problems include increase in crime war on drugs is primarily enforced by the prosecution of individuals who are engaged in the production sale distribution sale possession and use of drugs this automatically increases the number of people the government defines as criminals who in my opinion should not be considered criminals since drugs are illegal there exists a black market for them since there is a black market for drugs the people who would be business owners in a legitimate market now have to exist outside the law in order for drug dealers suppliers and cartels to handle market disputes they have to do it outside the legal framework this forces drug dealer and suppliers to resort to violence and murder in order to maintain their business this happens to any lucrative and unregulatedunderregulated business see the south african taxi wars  war on drugs also leads users who are caught with drugs to make their money in ways other than work if they have a criminal record as they cannot find work in the legitimate economy criminalization of a mentalpublic health issue addiction is a public health issue and people who are addicted to drugs are not criminals but often people who are suffering from mental health problems and selfmedicate using drugs in my opinion the way you help people with mental health problems is not by arresting them and putting them in prison but by giving them support and medical attention the war on drugs has made it more difficult for drug addicts to seek help has stigmatized their condition and criminalized their drug use making it more difficult for them to improve their quality of life and  often keeps them from being able to escape the cycle of drug use and addiction i do not think this is the best approach for mental health disorders that lead to substance abuse and is not only reducing the quality of life for drug addicts but actively preventing them from getting better violation of essential liberty war on drugs invades the essential liberty of all of us by stopping individuals from exercising our right to do what we want with our own bodies every individual should have the right to selfdetermination and should be allowed the freedom to do anything to their body even if it is harmful to their health it is not a crime to cut yourself drink alcohol or smoke eat unhealthy food and become obese or have unprotected sex therefore it shouldnt be a crime if you use a dangerous drug as long as the only person that is negatively effected is you  stunting scientific research war on drugs makes it incredibly difficult for any scientific researcher or institution to research drugs and how they interact with the human body since the brain is built on chemical signalling the best way to see how the brain works is to see the effects of chemical on the brain even through the limited research that has been conducted so much information on how the brain works has been learnt which can lead to better innovations in medicine and medical technology beyond that many of these illegal drugs have legitimate medical uses from medical cannabis to the psychedelic amphetamine doi having antiinflammatory effects drug assisted psychotherapy mdma for ptsd psilocybin for depression and end of life anxiety and ibogaine schedule 1 in the usa not only being used to help opiod addiction but also for the treatment of parkinsons disease making drugs more dangerous drugs are a prohibitive market there is no regulation as such drug dealers are not held to any legal responsibility for the purity or safety of the drugs they supply this is the main cause of the opiod overdose crisis in america using opiods as an example the most dangerous side effects of intravenous opiod use are caused by prohibition medically opiods can be used safely to treat pain and when used in a safe and ideal way they cause very few side effects not including addiction which is a mental condition and not a physical one and the damage to the body is minimal because heroin is illegal the alteration and misrepresentation of heroin is economically incentivized and has tainted the us heroin supply with fentanyl which is too potent to be dosed accurately leading to overdose as well as that the war on drugs has made it more difficult for intravenous drug users to obtain clean needles making the sharing of needles more common which increases the chance of infection as well as the spread of diseases that are transmitted through bodily fluids such as hiv the criminalization of drug users has made users more hesitant to call an ambulance in the event of overdoses for fear of being arrested for possession of drugs this is just one example the war on drugs is pointless issues would not matter as much if the war on drugs actually worked however the basic economic law of supply and demand as well as the inherent nature of drugs means that prohibition will never solve the issue but lead to an endless game of cat and mouse between drug dealerssuppliercartels and law enforcement even despite some of the harsh penalties for drugs the use of drugs has not decreased and all they have led to is suffering for drug addicts restrictions to scientific research and the handing over of a lucrative market to criminals though this is my opinion i want to understand why people are in opposition to the legalization of drugs so if youre for the war of drugs and opposed for legalization tell me why,1,1004,5944,120,0.03333333333333333
cmv committees in the house and senate should be run by actual scientists economists and experts,we see in several committees that politicians run them not experts in said field at times these politicians may not even have any knowledge a lack of knowledge or have agendas that hurt whatever committee theyre in some of them have no idea what theyre talking about for example  lamar smith was a republican who was a chairman in the committee of science space and technology he had a very antiscience approach and did not believe in climate change and tried to suppress climate scientists of this these committees should be run by actual experts like the committee of science should be run by scientists the cybersecurity subcommittee should be run by cybersecurity experts the armed services committee should be run by those who served in the armed services  wont be able to run these committees even if they were an expert in the field but they can advise the current experts in the committee this is to prevent corruption this way we wont have politicians denying climate change and being a chairman in the committee of science,1,180,1083,99,0.12121212121212122
cmv religious beliefs are essentially opinions and should not be given more weight than any other type of belief or opinion,"in the us there are various exceptions and accommodations for religious beliefs for instance catholic hospitals do not have to directly provide birth control and can instead sign a waiver with the actual birth control being supplied by a third party trump administration is currently considering granting additional protections and there are many conservatives who support the position that religious business owners should not have to serve gay couples for instance see two objections to this one practical and one more philosophical if applied to other characteristics of individuals such as race for example we would immediately say that people do not have the religious freedom to deny service to black americans on the basis of race such a view would be widely condemned as racist and hearkens back to the days of jim crow
 religious beliefs are simply beliefs and in a pluralistic society it does not make sense to continually grant exceptions to laws based on one category of beliefs without granting exceptions based on all categories if anyone for any reason could say i do not want to serve gay individuals at my restaurant that would be one thing but the policies being discussed grant that rightofdenial based only on religious beliefs find these religious freedom policies to be thinlyveiled attempts at discrimination but i also realize many americans genuinely disagree with me im hoping you can change my view and convince me that religious beliefs are indeed worthy of types of protections that beliefs justified in others ways are not  this was a really great discussion thanks everyone great first experience with cmv i partially changed my view based on recognizing that religious beliefs belong to an institution in addition to a person and that religion itself has been around for a long time and has some pretty stable qualities that we all recognize i still would like religious and nonreligious beliefs to be treated equally but i get that in certain circumstances it can make sense to take a religious belief seriously while skepticism can exist about a similar nonreligious belief

cmv keeping psychedelics illegal only holds back research and doesnt actually help any of the causes the prohibition claims to,first of all id just like to state the fact that i think a lot of this problem stems from how broad and problematic the word drugs is it refers to everything from coffee to heroin mushrooms to tylenol and im pretty sure most people agree that is too broad of a category to comfortably make blanket statements about understanding this a lot of people break things up into good drugs and bad drugs which is also completely useless because it always comes down to the person and the context a bit of mushrooms in a therapy session might be great for a terminal patient suffering from end of life anxiety but it might be horrible for someone with schizophrenia just like how sedatives might be good for certain people going into surgery but not for a depressed teenager with addiction problems my point with this is that its all relative and contextual refer to a specific subset of psychoactive compounds most commonly lsd psilocybin mushrooms dmt etc while mdma is not technically a classic psychedelic i will include it in the argument as most people do because of the massive amount of research coming out on its therapeutic effects similarities to psychedelic experiences and despite all this its status as a schedule 1 drug now i understand that despite the racist origins of drug prohibition in the west a lot of these policies are in place today not because of intentional malevolence but rather a continuing momentum from the past coupled with fear and a misguided attempt to keep everyone safe by prohibiting what youve been programmed to perceive as dangerous that being said it doesnt excuse the fact that the prohibition is not only keeping us from learning about an area of psychopharmacology which we already struggle to understand but its holding back research that could lead to breakthrough therapy capable of helping countless people therefor taking medicine out of the hands of people that desperately need it im not saying we should lift all prohibitive policy and fully legalise every psychoactive substance but what i am saying is that i dont believe it helps anyone having an all around ban on any substance making it illegal regardless of circumstance i would argue a large percentage of drugs that are illegal across the board have some sort of context in which their use makes sense even methamphetamine a drug thats dangers are widely known to most people is a schedule 2 substance under the understanding that there are certain medicaltherapeutic implementations for it so if we all understand how destructive methamphetamine can be yet we understand that it has its place how does it make any sense to place psychedelics in schedule 1 even if there are possible dangers attached even if you believe these substances are harmful and should have no place in society shouldnt we at least allow research into these substances to better understand them  if were being optimistic about the reasons they are illegal it would be because there isnt sufficient research they are possibly dangerous and keeping them illegal keeps them out of the hands of people who could possibly ruin their lives with them however psychedelics being illegal is the main reason there is a lack of research the lack of research contributes to the possible dangers involved in taking them and prohibition only creates a black market which doesnt stop anyone from doing them but just opens the door for research chemicals that are actually dangerous so how does sitting in ignorance of the subject help anybody thats my rant i feel like this is a pretty solid perspective but before committing it to belief id like to be as discerning as possible in finding holes in the idea using the help of you fine redditors im honestly open to whatever people have to say on the subject so please change my view ,1,654,3890,129,0.031007751937984496
cmv using race as a factor in us college admissions is under all circumstances wrong,"as a minority albeit one who gets the shit end of the stick when it comes to college admissions indian this is something that i have had a lot of trouble coming to a conclusion on hard to be a minority really really hard this is something i am unwilling to debate and will not change my mind on this matter i have suffered a great deal of racism and prejudice in my life just because i look different than most people even if im not considered by admissions officers as aggrieved enough to deserve a leg up because of this i know what its like to face discrimination as a person of color two wrongs do not make a right dr martin luther king dreamed of a country where his children would not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character this is what i believe america should stand for whether it comes to pursuing job opportunities making use of the financial system and also applying to college this in my opinion is nonnegotiable regardless of any good that this could have on society this is precisely why i have been so conflicted on this matter affirmative action has done a lot to benefit african americans latino americans and women in this country and having a diverse set of people on campus certainly has its benefits i am willing to acknowledge both of these but with all of the admissions scandals that have come to light in the last few months as well as the ongoing lawsuit against harvard i am beginning to lose my sense of compliance with the system this for example an admissions officer at harvard made the following note on an asianamerican applicant oh typical asian student wants to be a doctor nothing special here and then these people turn around and say oh we take all aspects of an applicants profile into account they are lying through their teeth shame on that officer i am sick of seeing so many of my friends and family face so much discrimination due to something that is out of their control we work so hard in life to succeed yet we are punished for being ourselves its time to draw a line in the sand viewpoint is as follows under no circumstances whatsoever should colleges take race into account when choosing to or not to admit a student nothing should compromise racial discrimination when it comes to college admissions if this negatively affects other minorities tough shit if this decreases the racial diversity of college campuses tough shit if this means that college campuses will be filled with a bunch of typical asians that want to be doctors fucking deal with it someone give me a convincing argument to think otherwise thank you everyone for your contributions id like to mass response with my opinions on some of the morediscussed topics eliminating legacy admissions im with this 100 statistically it might even completely solve the problem without anyone suffering discrimination even white people this in my view is probably the best solution right now
 making up for centuries of discrimination doesnt matter the people in the present did not contribute to the wrongdoings of their ancestors its difficult because the people that need to be held accountable are dead but this doesnt mean we discriminate back against people who werent even born yet
 why asians outperform other races has almost nothing to do with culture and mostly everything to do with immigration patterns
 affirmative action levels the playing field so does abolishing legacy admissions so does improving public education so does getting rid of gerrymandering and racist zoning laws there are plenty of ways to solve a complex problem so a lack of creativity is no excuse for injustice
 it’s not about disadvantaging asians it’s about giving an advantage college admissions is a zero sum game since there are a limited number of seats this means that you can’t lift one group up without disadvantaging another
 its okay to disadvantage some people because they still benefit from their ancestors actions no its not its not their fault 2 you have changed my mind kudos to andoverian and photobummer for the proof by contradiction good job bit more about my background first of all im a grad student in electrical engineering thats taken plenty of machine learning and artificial intelligence classes one of the things that we talk about a lot is that ai while it seems like it would be more impartial than humans is not it is completely dependent on data collected by humans and humans are biased in fact theyre even worse than humans since for the most part they lack the capacity to have selfawareness that humans do mentioned this in one of the comments below and the ones that i just shouted out pointed out that this is precisely the reason why we need affirmative action because humans are biased and bias needs to be monitored this really connects the question at hand with something that ive spent a lot of time studying which is why this realization has hit me so hard perhaps im blaming the wrong mechanism after all what im really angry about is that asian and indian americans are being discriminated against but this is happening because affirmative action is being used against us not for us i believe that affirmative action should be used to remind admissions officers that its not okay to reject an indian student on as blatantly shallow of a basis of being a typical indian my revised thesis affirmative action itself is not the problem  its that it is not being used to combat biases against asians and indians you to every single one of you who contributed ive responded to many of you as i could the past day and have given deltas to those who gave arguments that genuinely gave me an interesting unique and convincing perspective but i am going to leave this case to rest for now im still passionate about discrimination and how it plays out with affirmative action and perhaps someday ill make another cmv regarding how asians and indians are treated in college admissions until then though im happy that we were all able to have this discussion",1,1059,6399,90,0.06666666666666667
cmv all classified govt material should be unclassified after 100 years,"i believe that transparency is a hugely important thing for the govt of a civil society one of the things that protects bad actors is the ability to hide their misdeeds from the public different justifications are used  most along the lines of national security but i believe the knowledge that 50 or 75 years after their death the legacy of officials might be marred by corrupt or illegal acts being revealed would cause more bad behavior to be avoided than good but necessary behavior might be discouraged i believe that all classified confidential topsecret etc regardless of whatever of level of secrecy material should be declassified once it becomes 100 years old  people ive said this to tend to agree with me there are only three arguments ive heard that even try to argue against it that the grandchildren of an award winning hero may be traumatized to learn that it was actually a cover and their ancestor actually died due to friendly fire a procedural error or some other lessthanhonorable manner  that knowing that history would eventually see all their deeds would cause officials to make safe or nice or passive decisions when sometimes dangerous or mean or aggressive actions are absolutely necessary  that learning of some horrific act done 100 years ago by completely different people and a completely different govt would still inspire acts of violent retaliation by individuals or even state actors today
 will not change my mind 
  1 is entirely unconvincing to me while i would feel sympathy for someone learning that a powerful motivating family narrative was a fabrication to cover something  dirty  i still think declassifying everything after 100 years is of much greater benefit to society than that cost
  examples of public officials choosing due to contemporary public pressure a passive decision rather than a aggressive decision resulting in negative consequences to change my mind 
 demonstrate with historical examples how  or  has happened with significant negative consequence

 i think that college was a little too late to even have a class like that and i had wished that through elementary school middle school and high school that i had been continuously exposed to this so i can keep my mental swords sharp
 see way too many people nowadays believing in the first things that they see without evaluating whether it is actually true or an acceptable argument or whatnot and i really cannot think of a downside to having this as a class taught at every level of public education

 it seems like a lot of people are commenting about the dissatisfaction of debating classes i’ve never taken a debate class so i don’t know what it entails but i just thought about it as in the realm of not speech and debate  competitive debating but rather just how to effectively argue with someone and learning about things like the code of intellectual conduct lots of good discussion though surprised this got so much traction",1,248,1411,123,0.032520325203252036

cmv high prices on emergency medical treatment should be considered price gouging,"  was listening to a podcast about the high price of air ambulances the couple being interviewed for the episode had been severely injured in a car accident and they had to be airlifted to the hospital the wife was airlifted by a one helicopter and received a bill for 1700 the husband was airlifted by a different helicopter and received a bill for 13000  
 laws of supply and demand do not exist when a person is having a medical emergency as the person does not have a meaningful choice to decline the necessary treatment the same is true for someone who needs lifesaving drugs like insulin or hiv treatment high pricing i mean more than needed to maintain a modest profit and stay in business an acceptable price is one that all things equal is just high enough to incentivize the provider to keep offering the product or service in the above example the helicopter that charged 1700 was making enough to stay in business so the 13000 price was clearly excessive the us price gouging laws apply only to areas in a temporary state of emergency im not arguing whether or not price gouging laws are good policy in general but rather that given the existing framework of protections for individuals who live in areas in a state of emergency the same framework should be applied to individuals in a personal state of medical emergency",1,239,1552,82,0.04878048780487805
cmv capitalism is not an inherently evil economic system it is subject to excesses and abuse like any other system but is no better or worse than others,according to wikipedia capitalism is economic system in it the government plays a secondary role people and companies make most of the decisions and own most of the property goods are usually made by companies and sold for profit the means of production are largely or entirely privately owned by individuals or companies and operated for profit” the purest definition of capitalism individuals are encouraged to own property to create products and businesses and to work for their own benefit  whether as a solopreneur or a part of a larger corporation  isn’t a zerosum game just because i gain some profit doesn’t mean i’m taking away from someone else unless i create a product that draws customers away from a competitor even then the competition is free to catch up or to surpass me in market share or to grow the share of available market  there are excesses under capitalism  imho its due to greed run amok but all other forms of economic systems can also be corrupted by greed and illegal activities but there is nothing that makes capitalism any worse than any other form of economic system,1,193,1162,156,0.03205128205128205
cmv being apolitical is intellectual laziness and not a trait to be proud of,out of all places on the political spectrum the most infuriating one is those who claim they dont care about politics for whatever reason all politicians are bad just for example no adult should be proud of this stance  isnt some kind of enlightenment those concerned with politics have simply failed to have this is how every child in middle school and under thinks this is intellectual sloth and a resignation to being a passenger to life like it or not politics directly affect each and every one of us  dont expect people to stress over the political climate day in and out no one has time for that but staying informed and participating in discourse is crucial to progress  to anyone who can make a case for this school of thought this is not a stance on whether or not you identify as left or right or whatever i am personally a centrist as far as policy goes this is about the choice to stay ignorant ,1,171,952,79,0.05063291139240506
cmv buying a brand new car is a huge financial mistake for most people,i have an old ford taurus with about 265000 miles on it i’ve been looking into buying a new car because it’s likely only a matter of time before something goes wrong with my car and the repair cost isn’t worth it however i’ve been arguing with my parents about whether i should buy a new or used car i’ve always felt like the premium you pay to drive the first 50000 miles of a new car is insane certain kinds of maintenance at higher mileages are inevitable and buying a new car just means you’re pushing those costs further down the road — but you do ultimately need to pay them anyway  only points i can really think of in favor of buying a brand new car are that you don’t know how well a used car has been maintained before buying it — regular oil changes coolant flushes etc — and that used car loans have higher interest rates even still i don’t see how paying thousands of dollars more for a new car is worth avoiding those issues having a new car is a luxury but i don’t believe it’s a financially sound decision to make and is mostly wasteful spending,1,205,1081,71,0.056338028169014086
cmv lolicon is a form of pedophilia and shouldn’t be treated like it’s normal,i’m not saying we should persecute those who view it or enjoy it  but acting as if it’s a normal thing that should be encouraged in otherwise healthy individuals isn’t something i agree with i could make this longer but my gist is this doesn’t matter if the lore says it’s 1000 years old it doesn’t matter if they’re based on a real person whom is of legal age liking someone sexually based on their childlike appearance is at a minimum pedophilia adjacent reference i’m a mid 20s woman that is often mistaken for 15 or younger people that age often hit on me and so do men much older  my actual age doesn’t take away from the fact that these people are interested because of how i look as well as the young characteristics i possess hell i’ve even had boyfriends whom were heavily into lolicon and admitted it to be a facet of why they liked me i don’t think they’re bad people  i’m glad they choose people that can satisfy their desires while remaining perfectly legal does squeak me out anyway though a few things i want to clarify before i start sending out more replies pedophilia is not having sex or molesting or raping kids pedophilia is strictly the attraction to those whom are prepubescent it does not denote any actions as such i do not believe anyone who simply is a pedophilia should be persecuted at all,1,245,1371,79,0.05063291139240506
cmv better funding for education is the most assured way to combat many issues in society,climate change viruses social inequality if we don’t have the resources or ideas to solve these issues now then we should be preparing a citizenry that is better educated one that knows how to better gather resources and solve issues we need mass education initiatives to be strongly funded argue that throwing money at educational institutions and departments won’t solve education issues because ultimately what we have is a mismanagement of funds i agree that there is some mismanagement of funds as someone who has seen it first hand and that we need to think of ways to solve this issue as well but the more institutions have at their disposal the more that will inevitably make its way into improving education and who’s to say that it wouldn’t also result in administrations that better know how to manage money it just seems to me that no matter how you look at these situations education is at the center or foundation of making long term progress on many issues so because of some of the comments i do have to modify my position ultimately what i am concerned with is our attitude toward education as a society and the political actions we take because of that attitude i do want education to be better funded and think it could fix some of the issue we complain about but the reality is that probably wont happen until out perspectives about education change  to clarify yes i really think that certain things should be taught in school  and im unabashed about that at this point i do agree with scientists and academics on any issue i take the time to study so i think we should teach that and i dont think parents in an ideal world should have the right to deny their child that information also i think teaching students how to think will lead them to those conclusions themselves anyway and again parents shouldnt be allowed to deny their parents this type of education it does seem to me that facts have a liberal bias overall though many groups of people including liberals have their issues and wed be better off if we could agree on what experts agree on that being said i am not in as much fear about what giving educational institutions more power would do as someone who is apart of this group and think those who want to spin some conspiracy are doing so with a bad understanding of epistemology or in bad faith so your chances of convincing me that my colleagues and i have some type of nefarious agenda to make a bunch of robots like us or some other such nonsense are very low,1,455,2571,90,0.044444444444444446
cmv violently attacking trump supporters or stealing maga hats is 100 inexcusable and makes you look like an idiot,i would like to begin with stating i do not particularly like president trump his personality is abhorrent but policy wise he does some things i dont like and others im fine with ultimately i dont care about trump nearly as much as other do a tweet has emerged where people where honored for snatching maga hats from the heads of 4 tourists and stomping them on the ground turns out these people where northkorean defects and they live in southkorea providing aid for those less fortunate they simply had maga hats because they support what trump is doing in relations to nk the way americans treated them is disgusting and honestly really embarrassing other recent news people have been legitamatly assaulted wounded and hospitalized because people who didnt agree with their political opinion decided to harm them why cant we all just come together and be less polarized the sake of my own humanity i hope nobody disagrees but maybe somebody has some really good examples evidence viewpoints etc that justify these actions to an extent if so many people like this type of treatment of others there has to be some sort of logical explanation,1,197,1190,117,0.06837606837606838

cmv people who cant afford kids shouldnt have them,ive seen this sentiment expressed from time to time and quite to my surprise it often generates a lot of anger and controversy why according to the usda it costs around 230000 to raise a single kid from 0 to 18 and that figure doesnt even include college that figure averages out to a little over 1000mo  4 i brought up these figures more to highlight the so far practically unargued point that having kids is expensive as several people have pointed out using the 230000 figure is a bit misleading because thats just an average some would say over inflated for a certain category of people in one country some kids will take less to raise some will take more so to kind of move away from a specific number id rather frame this issue in a series of questions questions like can you afford to feed your child three meals a day will you be able to afford to house and clothe your child will you be able to cover healthcare costs when you child is sick injured or just needs routine checkups will you be able to pay for some baseline extracurricular activities for your child so they can grow up to be a functional and well rounded adult will you be able to be present as a parent for your child or will you be too busy working three jobs if the answer is no to these sorts of questions thats what id define as not being able to afford children not a specific mo say it was possible to engage in an 18 year lease agreement one its almost impossible to get out of for a quarter of a million dollar car costing the driver 1000mo for almost two decades it would be a totally common sense and uncontroversial thing to say that people who cant afford that lease particularly poorer and struggling people should not enter that agreement much less two three four five  seperate agreements at 230000 a pop if someone is broke and struggling but also was leasing an aston martin and a lamborghini youd probably think they were making very poor financial decisions but swap out that luxury vehicle with a child or three and suddenly people get upset when you suggest theyre making poor decisions why if anything id think that itd be better for poor people to pay for the car than the kid  having a kid even beyond the sheer cost makes your already struggling life even harder arbitrarily and also worsens the quality of life for the child ie another human being a luxury vehicle isnt going to wake you up crying every night or your job doesnt have to be structured around what time the car gets out of daycare the childs quality of life in terms of health academics enjoyment etc is obviously lessened by having parents who cant actually properly afford their existence  then because rightly we dont want children to suffer unduly or die due to their parents irresponsible procreation choices society has to step in and help foot the bill for their wellbeing im not opposed to this happening but it is worth noting it wouldnt generally even have to be a thing if people who cant afford kids didnt have them  im not advocating for any kind of mandate ban or law i just think its a shitty financial decision i think the same of a lot of financial decisions but for whatever reason it seems there is pushback when these poor financial decisions pertain to children ive never seen someone get up in arms over the suggestion that people who are struggling and poor probably shouldnt invest in bad timeshare contracts or whatever edit 6 was bolding this for emphasis  several people have responded like this paragraph didnt exist know what to do cheers 1 should also note im viewing this subject through a lens of a concurrent developed nation particularly the us which is where i live obviously in other parts of the world 230000 could be enough to raise a thousand kids 2 we are currently experiencing higher than normal response volume your reply is important to us please be patient and a certified op will be with you as soon as possible 3 one delta awarded so far for someone pointing out the utility and practicality of having children to stave off a low birth rate which is vital for a strong and functioning economy my view was very much focused on individual choice and i hadnt considered societal need 5 many people are bringing up that i ought to be more focused on creating a society where everyone who wants kids can afford them and people have access to the educationbirth control aspects of family planning i dont disagree with those goals at all but until we create that society if we ever do we ought to be wise about the decisions we make in the current system which is the gist of the op 6 frankly im not going to be able to get to all these replies but there seem to be plenty of people chiming in from both sides of this issue so hopefully this discussion will continue ill keep at this until my laptop battery dies currently at 52 and then im calling it quits for at least a few hours thanks to everyone

cmv cancel culture and changing cartoon characters is mostly a way for white people to virtue signalbe saviors,1 the fsu seminoles and the chicago blackhawks have specific permission from those tribes to use those names  yet they constantly get badgered by people not even in those tribes to change the name and that its racist i am referring to those two teams specifically because they have that permission from tribal council  if those tribes allow it who are we to tell them to change it i understand that it is extremely hard for poc voice actors to break into the profession however that needs to be reminded by new character being created  cast not white voice actors being pushed out a job theyve held for years to not get cancelled the majority of people who were calling for the man who voiced cleveland to step down were white i also understand that that note i believe that we need to defer to pocminorities when a certain character is in question  speedy gonzales is a good example white people pushed for his removal while mexicans and mexicanamericans protested for him to stay its not for us people who are not in that community to decide whether a character is good or bad the creator of ghost in the shell loved the casting of scarlett johansson  which was accurate anyway because the robot that the main character resides in is outwardly european  casting an asian woman wouldve been inaccurate to the story but who complained white americans dragging videostweetsetc made years or even a decade plus ago by famous people or influencers does nothing and implies that society as a whole refuses to forgive such transgressions and that theres no reason to try and strive to be better because it wont be believed anyway  especially when theyve already apologized for it and theres no other instances of such behavior recently jenna marbles got bullied off of youtube for videos she made almost a decade ago and had already apologized for and there were no other questionable videos since then what then is the point of dredging it up years later feel the same with issues involving cultural appropriation  i constantly see white people putting down other white people for appreciating a culture i stead of appropriating it when poc arent even complaining about that specific issue  did the polynesian people care that little white girls wanted to be moana for halloween or did white people care so they could look enlightened conclusion i understand that as we have privilege we need to use our voices to help poc and minorities but i believe there are two main issues we end up talking over them and trying to tell them what they should be offended by which implies theyre not intelligent enough to decide by themselvesis incredibly infantilizing we pull years old tweets and attack influencers and celebrities while refusing to believe that they have changed in the years since and also see that behavior as problematic now in an attempt to virtue signal and act like a good person just really dont think that this is the way to legitimately help poc  obviously if they also agree there is an issue thats not the case but i also think that problematic behavior from the past should be forgiven if that person has worked to become better  but we refuse to believe that its not a publicity stunt when they do,1,572,3314,116,0.034482758620689655
cmv a negative paternity test should exclude a man from paying child support and any money paid should be returned unless there was a legal adoption,there have been many cases ive read recently where men are forced to pay support or jailed for not paying support to children proven not to be theirs this is either because the woman put a mans name on the forms to receive assistance and he didnt get the notification and its too late to fight it or a man had a cheating wife and she had a child by her lover believe this is wrong and should be ended it is unjust to force someone to pay for a child that isnt theirs unless they were in the know to begin with and a legal adoption took place to that end i believe a negative dna test should be enough to end any child support obligation and that all paid funds should be returned by the fraudulent mother as for monetary support of the child that would then be upon the mother to either support the child herself or take the biological father to court to enforce his responsibility came up in a group conversation and i was told it was wrong and cruel to women but the other party could not elaborate on how or why im looking for the other side of this coin hello users of cmv this is a footnote from your moderators wed just like to remind you of a couple of things firstly please remember to read through our rules if you see a comment that has broken one it is more effective to report it than downvote it speaking of which downvotes dont change views if you are thinking about submitting a cmv yourself please have a look through our popular topics wiki first any questions or concerns feel free to message us happy cmving,1,293,1865,150,0.02666666666666667

cmv tipping as a practice should be done away with and restaurants should instead pay their workers a living wage,a lot of restaurants as you may know especially if you’ve worked in the service sector do not pay their employees minimum wage instead they rely on tipshares to make up for whatever they are not paying their employees this is effective in keeping costs lower than they would typically be but it seems like a failed practice elsewhere some people just don’t tip or don’t know how to tip appropriately servers are under a lot more pressure and stress than they might be if they knew they would have a guaranteed steady wage overall it’s a strange practice and i think it’s ineffective of the arguments against this are that it keeps prices lower but hypothetically you’re just adding what you would normally pay as a tip onto the price of a meal the amount you spend won’t necessarily change given that you’re tipping properly another is that servers will be further incentivized to give good service if they are being tipped but restaurant work shouldn’t be different that types of work where you’re not being tipped if you’re a good employee your performance should be good the level of service you provide won’t necessarily change because you aren’t dependent on tips i think the levels of stress and duress would also be lower and the atmosphere of working in a restaurant would be far more pleasant without that added pressure i think overall abolishing the practice of tipping seems the most efficient and logical thing to do,1,249,1462,114,0.03508771929824561

cmv gender dysphoria is a mental illness and it’s nothing to be ashamed of but we need to stop pretending like it isn’t,"edit i’m editing my post because i used the terms disorder and illness as interchangeable when they aren’t it should be disorder in the title and not illness  i begin i want to clarify that i’m definitely not one of those people who thinks transgender people shouldn’t transition what i believe and what i understand is that as of now the best and most effective treatment to gender dysphoria is transition however i think people need to stop saying that gender dysphoria isn’t a mental disorder here’s why the dsmv recognizes it as such gender dysphoria meets the requirements for a mental disorder to be classified as one i’m not a professional and i don’t know them all by heart but to make a few there’s the fact that it keeps people from functioning properly in society when untreated and that it causes great distress for the people experiencing it
2 it actually advantages trans people if gender dysphoria is classified as a mental disorder because that way certain insurance companies will pay for their transition

 i understand that this can fuel rightisttransphobic arguments but i think that denying reality like some governments do isn’t going to actually help in the long run to build up on point  people often refute this argument by saying that homosexuality was once considered a mental illness but was then removed and that considering gender dysphoria as a mental disorder is somehow part of a transphobic agenda however i just don’t think these two things are comparable homosexuality doesn’t cause distress or inability to properly fonction or anything like that it was removed in the dsm because it was wrongfully put there and it didn’t fit the criteria with gender dysphoria it’s not the same story because it does fit the criteria",1,299,1806,121,0.049586776859504134
cmv the singer of should i stay or should i go should go,"after carefully reviewing the lyrics of should i stay or should i go i have come to the conclusion that the singernarrator is in an unhealthy relationship and should leave some key takeaways
 you say that you are mine be here till the end of time
 bargaining demanding something out of a relationship with lofty promises that will certainly not be delivered on the singer is being possessive and demanding of their partner which is already unhealthy the promise to be here till the end of time is hyperbole and cant be trusted
 always tease tease tease happy when im on my knees day its fine and next its black if you want me off your back come on and let me know i stay or should i go
 most telling verse in my opinion the partner is clearly not committed to this relationship and seems to only be happy when the singer is down the singer is unable to grasp the fact that they are being taken advantage of but is beginning to discover that their partner is not as involved in this relationship as they are
 indecisions bugging me you dont want me set me free whom im supposed to be you know which clothes even fit me on and let me know i cool it or should i blow
 in ecuadorian spanish this verse only provides more certainty that the singers love is unrequited the partner is flighty and doesnt seem to be concerned with the singers life much at all leading the singer to an existential crisis and complete breakdown of grammatical norms as be questions exactly whom sic im supposed to be
 most telling line of course is in the chorus  as the narrator catches a glimpse of truth

 is the most honest line of the song as the singer realizes that he will be happier if he leaves despite the difficulty and uncertainty that leaving a relationship can cause he catches on to the fact that staying in an unhealthy relationship will cause even more difficulty and uncertainty the singer should leave this relationship and ideally focus on healing his own issues with codependency and possessiveness before entering in another relationship  this is a footnote from the cmv moderators wed like to remind you of a couple of things firstly please read through our rules if you see a comment that has broken one it is more effective to report it than downvote it speaking of which downvotes dont change views any questions or concerns feel free to message us happy cmving",1,455,2914,60,0.16666666666666666
cmv if a company is important enough to warrant a bailout then its important enough to be nationalized,with the all the recent talk of bailouts for airline companies cruiselines and other major entities  i find myself returning to thoughts i had during the 2008 financial crisis i dont like that public funds are being used to save private industry the nature of the free market is supposed to be that when the economy goes tits up companies either sink or swim only the government should be able to insulate itself with public funds and if a company wants to perpetuate itself on tax dollars then it should sell its assets to the us government to make that happen  really dont like this view but i cant think of any valid  reason to bail out such luxury industries like passenger flights and cruise lines and expect basically nothing in return i get that if my view were the norm then thered be a lot of ruined lives and unemployed people but thats the nature of the free market if you get screwed because of volatile business practices you allowed to fester in your company thats on you the government and by extension we the people have no obligation to save your company because you made a bad business decision if you want something fromthe government then it should be like any other corporate takeover your business will survive but it wont be yours anymore,1,229,1292,106,0.03773584905660377
cmv being old enough to have your own child means youre old enough to elect to get a surgical procedure to prevent having a child,i was speaking with a friend that frequents rchildfree as do i and he a recent college grad doesnt want to have kids hes in his early 20s he approached his gp to discuss this and the gp refused due to my friends age and experience mean to tell me someone that has been physically capable of creating a child for a decade or so lacks the maturity to be able to make this type of decision for himself this may be law in some places i dont know im infertile anyway so it isnt a problem for me but this seemsfeels pretty gross  lets assume the person in this scenario is an adult  i was definitely not advocating for 12 year old kids to be able to get elective surgery,1,133,724,131,0.030534351145038167
cmv political parties are bad for electing a good candidate because it causes people to vote along party lines rather than the most proper candidate,i don’t like to identify myself under a party because in my opinion a candidate should be voted for if you see them most fit for office and would benefit the country best not just who is primarily representing your party  think it’s ridiculous that states are constantly stuck voting for the lead candidate of the same party i’m from mississippi and i would be willing to bet that we have voted for the lead republican candidate since before my parents were alive people will have more incentive to select a political party that their future policies won’t actually represent because they’re more likely to get more votes it’s essentially become impossible to elect someone not republican or democrat because states in the south will always vote republican excluding florida as its a swing state and states in the northeast will always vote democrat quote i remember fondly from george washington’s fairwell address in 1796  however political parties may now and then answer popular ends they are likely in the course of time and things to become potent engines by which cunning ambitious and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people and to usurp for themselves the reins of government destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion,1,219,1328,149,0.026845637583892617
cmv people should not be heavily criticized for things they put on social media in the distant past,i think that it is unfair for the internet to come down hard on people for things they put on social media a long time ago im talking about cases such as james gunn getting fired over tweets he made a long time ago 20092010 and doja cat getting criticized for using the word faggot in tweets from a few years back too heres why i hold this view people change i think we can all say that the person you are today is not the person you were 10 years ago your beliefs and values change as time goes by shaped by your varying life experiences 10 years is a long time in which many things can happen that drastically change your view on things this is especially true throughout adolescence when your thinking matures and your life is rapidly changing personally many of my views were black and white years ago but as ive gone through more experiences my views have changed into something more grey i think it would be really unreasonable if you treated me as if the only views i hold today were the views i held 10 years ago many of which i would find abhorrent today peoples lives dont revolve around social media building on the first point peoples views could change without them having to edit their social media history to reflect that if my opinion on a subject matter changes im probably not going to dig through my entire post history to delete every post that goes against my newly formed opinion i think its unreasonable to expect anyone to do that now i dont know for sure if people like james gunns views on things have changed since he first made the comments that he did even if those views were changed i dont expect him to dig through 10 years worth of tweets to delete offensive tweets im not denying that people should be responsible for what they put online but i do think that others ought to be more understanding instead of simply dismissing a person for a distant mistake in the past cmv wow really didn’t expect this to blow up rip inbox i’m gonna have to take the time to try and reply as much as possible,1,381,2098,100,0.04
cmv i am islamophobic,i mean that in both senses of the word i hate islam and i am afraid of islam i do not hate muslims for being islamic rather i see them as victims of an oppressive system have done my best to listen to as many viewpoints as possible on this subject both for and against my best friend for thirty years was muslim as was his family i was very close to them in large part i began to change from neutral to anti on islam because i never observed it giving anything positive to my friend he behaved as if it were an anchor around his neck an obligation never a source of hope or joy or enlightenment could list the reasons i think islam is harmful but i dont want this conversation to become a slog of nitpicking over definitions and statistics i will say i believe islam is unacceptable based on its widespread homophobia alone posting here because whenever i have criticized islam the response has been overwhelmingly negative and i do not understand why to the best of my knowledge i have never had a muslim tell me they were personally offended by my opinions it is always nonmuslims sometimes even atheists defending islam with a vigor as if i insulted a family member this is baffling to me such consistent opposition to my position i need to consider that i am likely wrong but i am almost never shown why opposition comes in the form of telling me i am a terrible person and should not judge others i dont see why not as i believe every human has the right to judge and be judged what i am asking here is can anyone show me what is good in islam that justifies accepting or overlooking its harmful aspects i got a response the other day that put so much in my head i had to step away from replying  there is a great deal of variation within the muslim community in their opinions about these issues and closer analyses suggest that islam plays virtually no role in generating the distinctive opinions of muslims muslims are more religious than other canadians but nonreligious muslims are more different from nonreligious nonmuslims than highly religious muslims are from highly religions nonmuslims the effects of religion are not ruled out by the evidence uncovered in this paper but nor does the religiosity hypothesis emerge as a standalone or especially persuasive explanation for the patterns of opinions among muslimcanadians islam it seems is not “the problem” and efforts to curb the practice and visibility of islam  efforts which are well under way in some european countries  are unlikely to address the ideological distinctiveness of muslims even about social issues like gay rights and abortion yes this has succeeded in changing my view i no longer hate islam i hate muslims and to be perfectly clear this is not a violent hate it is a bottomlesslydisappointed hate like the bible or the book of mormon the quran is a book of fiction i already know that art cannot force people to act so how could i blame islam how could i blame a gun more than the one who pulls its trigger i had already known that american muslims are vastly different from muslims in other countries and it finally hit me that if the religion itself is the same the difference is the culture the people its the people who choose to identify as muslim who use it to justify their desire for peace or their desire for bigotry whatever is in their hearts islam is not the source it is the excuse now realize that what i feel towards muslims is exactly the same disgust i feel towards the fans of rick and morty who threw insane childish tantrums in public restaurants it is exactly how i felt towards the fans of avatar who convinced themselves that their soul is actually a navi and theyll be one again when they die it is exactly how i feel towards the fans of steven universe who ignored the core values of the show and bullied a fan artist into attempting suicide then turned against the shows creators when they were told to stop because they felt morally justified i am not making this comparison frivolously a religion is nothing more than a toxic fandom the only difference is how recently the central work was created embarrassing is that that after so many centuries these holy books could have passed into myth but they havent we can read aesops fables without insisting they are the only possible source of morality we can take the lessons of greek mythology without believing in the pantheon we can enjoy marvel superheroes without praying to them yes i know this is not an original thought but its only now hit me the enormity of it if the quran were allowed to be merely a book i would merely dislike it if i thought about it at all my problem is the people so weak of individual spirit that they need it to be more i entirely understand the need for humans to seek purpose but seek it find your own find it in other people how lazy to accept it prepackaged because someone told you heres all the answers you can stop questioning now watched star trek without calling myself a trekkie ive watched my little pony without calling myself a brony i dont make my enjoyment of those shows my primary descriptor i dont make it my life i called myself a mgtow for about a week i saw a video that explained it and i liked the concept of not letting other people define you then i took a look at the community and saw it was almost entirely broken bitter men complaining about their exes the community were not upholding the ideas i had been attracted to so i stopped calling myself mgtow i called myself a libertarian for a little while i read about it and thought its values lined up well with mine then i saw too many libertarians expressing support for anarchocapitalism this was not a belief i shared so i stopped calling myself libertarian because i didnt want something i dont believe in to be someone elses first impression of me have never in my life heard someone say 911 was the day i decided to stop being a muslim or the day of the pulse nightclub shooting or after hearing about the rotherham rapes or on and on and on what do i hear instead please dont blame my religion i dont anymore blame you the person who chooses to belong to it entirely understand the insidious family pressure islamic culture uses to keep people ensnared and the disgusting practice of murdering apostates but the catholic church was one of the most powerful forces in the world droves of people left after the reveal of their unspeakably evil systematic protection of child rapists and while the catholic church still exists as an entity numbers are strength and theirs are dwindling muslims could follow the example of catholics leave in such great numbers that the zealots cant kill you all they could if they chose to if you absolutely must keep that word branded on your forehead you could at least not let others decide how it makes you behave say this with a lot of pain id rather forgive id rather not hate this is not a gloating victory lap

cmv there’s no fact or logic based reason to deny climate change the only reason republicans deny it is because it’s a primary democrat talking point,"
the science is clear that climate change is real and we’re causing it 99 of the people saying it’s not true have zero working knowledge of the issue and have zero credibility the only reason republicans deny it is because a democrat brought it to the forefront and it’s primarily a democrat talking point had a republican brought it to the public eye they’d be signing a completely different tune  worth of study and vigorous research has gone into understanding climate change and there’s mountains of evidence proving it’s happening and we’re causing it if you’re denying it odds are you’re a republican for one and you have no real working knowledge of the topic just parroted information that’s easily disproven with a very quick google search by “republicans” i’m more referring to the common citizen not the politicians they’re definitely preaching against it for the money 2 clarification i’m not tying to lump the south together i used it as a general term for the region i lived in my personal experiences with climate change deniers comes from living in western kentucky for about a decade i am not speaking of the rest of “the south”",1,198,1196,152,0.03289473684210526
cmv most people are not well read enough to reasonably advocate for political or economic change,edit well read was a poor choice of words i think have done their due diligence might be more accurate writing this because i want to be proven wrong because people saying political things especially as if obvious has started to annoy and anger me more especially if theyre making fun of someone for their political views even if i disagree with those views i hate feeling angry so hopefully writing my thoughts out will help trying to figure out my own political views ive come to realize that i cant reasonably hold the views i held or any other views i studied economics mainly the school of thought that appealed to me but then more and more i came to realize that i couldnt say if the keynesian or postkeynesian or the chicago school or mmt etc were correct and that even people who devote their lives to the study of economics struggle with the same thing the same thing happened in philosophy especially as i came to realize the importance of epistemology and ontology you cant reasonably expect people to put in the effort and time that it takes to sort through these fields and that there is still such debate among the experts that even if you become and expert the truth will not be obvious ive come to understand what socrates meant when he said something like i only know that i know nothing also come to believe that people hold the beliefs they do more for social reasons less for the truth of the beliefs but more because their reaffirm their identity and their social bonds cant blame them for that or for not spending thousands of hours sorting through political thought philosophy and economics but a part of me still believes that they havent done their due diligence and i get angry that they can affirm themselves and their beliefs while i sit here uncertain unable to succinctly articulate why or how to get this across properly,1,333,1929,97,0.041237113402061855
cmv people who actively decline to donate organs should be declined organ donations themselves,"i see how this is a morally problematic stance
i am generally not for “what goes around comes around” approaches but in my view organ donations are literally a matter of life issue and arise above just the individual
it’s more than just being a little egoistic if you purposefully decline to save other people’s lives
if you actively which includes being over 18 and mentally stable decline to donate your organs than i personally think it is fair to not grant you such a valuable gift 
on the other side such a rule could push people to rethink their stance and would probably have an immensely positive effect on the number of organ donors only two problems i see with this is that in reality it will be tough to draw such a border between those who “actively” decline organs and those who might be pressured by their environment or aren’t stable etc and that such a restriction could lead to a sort of organ elitism by people then demand that we should also not give organs to addicts obese people etc often religious believes are a reason for not wanting to donate i think that a lot of those believes also include not wanting to receive strangers organs anyways am really interested to hear your thoughts on this cmv
 this has been an exciting read so far as some things keep on being brought up this is a thought experiment i’m not in a position to enforce anything i’m here to challenge a viewpoint and that overall philosophical not bureaucratically this is about people actively opting out on donation not people being unable to donor due to illness etc at those are not active choices  i agree that the optout system is a great way to increase donations and i am very much for it’s implementation if we wanna go down the rabbits whole of implementing the here proposed scenario it was actually what i had in mind because in the optout scenario an active choice is the most obvious but this would further of course need a lot of detailed legal work i am unable to provide",1,358,2042,95,0.042105263157894736

cmv the united states government in its current incarnation is largely if not wholly illegitimate,"congress literally does not care what the majority of americans think instead they only care what a rich few do theyre kept on a leash by their campaign donors and spend more time on average in office fundraising for the next election cycle rather than enacting laws nonetheless the fact that congress members dont read the bills they vote on maybe if they didnt have to fundraise they could probably still wouldnt but whatever
 campaign donations will inherently lead to corruption i base this claim on the fact that a significant majority 8092 of the time the person who wins an election is the person who received more donations and fundraising  have literally been times when congress passed laws directly handed to them by businesses aka private citizens
 approval rating currently sits at a crazy low 20 with 75 of us actively disapproving of them  of this contributes to my idea that i would even go so far to say that every sitting member of congress in its current iteration is corrupt beyond belief and is a hostile entity an enemy of the united states the constitution and the people our democracy is not representative of our actual population or our beliefs instead its a puppet legislative organization and if you follow the money its basically a bunch of ceos having a bid war for the future of our world that i think ought to be done which are also likely to be dumb and underthought outlaw campaign donations and outside interference in elections each candidate gets a set amount of money from the fec in order to make their platform heard political ads paid for by nonaffiliates of the involved candidates then also become illegal only those ads paid for by their affiliates can be aired or shown granted this would not affect journalism if a scandal breaks it breaks just not in the form of advertising all forms of edit monetary lobbying should instantaneously be made illegal the dumbest idea try every member of congress for perjury on the idea that they lied under oath  do solemnly swear or affirm that i will support and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies foreign and domestic that i will bear true faith and allegiance to the same that i take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion and that i will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which i am about to enter so help me god” they are not protecting the constitution from domestic enemies and rather have become them they are not well or faithfully discharging their duties spending more time fundraising than legislating
perjury is defined as lying under oath but only becomes a crime when they intentionally reaffirm this in this case reelection would even argue some of this could be considered treasonous behavior i really want to be wrong so please change my view is made of entirely corrupt individuals not representing the us population or their constituents and has lost their legitimacy a word spelled instantaneously wrong lol formatting for senate oath 3 im in class for the time being im going to try to respond to you all as quickly as i can when i get out thank you for all the responses this is the biggest post ive ever made and ive been really enjoying the discussion in the comments a lot of you guys have totally fair points just got out edited some stuff changed wording of lobbying point to be about corrupt lobbying  campaign donations are not free speech this is incentivized speech

cmv the trend of video games becoming a service instead of a tangible single product like they always used to be is not a net positive for gamers,"as i see it with technologies like google stadia ms xcloud and potentially others in the near future publishers and developers try to take every bit of control and sense of ownership from the hands of the end users the gamers can accept the arguments of practicality and ease of use but i reckon that it should only remain an option and that the delivery of games should continue to be handled the traditional way  which means via either physical or digital copies practically owned by the user stored in his drives and operated at his own time of choice without the need for subscriptions very short list of the main problems so i find in game streaming  the sense of ownership is totally abolished you essentially rent the games you play month to month paying a fee for that time and never owning anything for offline use you could pay hundreds of dollars and if you don’t pay for one more month you end up with nothing but thin air the image quality streaming is actually video video is always noisy compared to locally rendered graphics  yes even video sourced from 4k blu rays doesn’t compare with the cleanliness and vibrancy in absence of more proper words of a game rendered on the screen of my pc by my rig i think it’s an intrinsic video feature that cannot be improved much  if at all i hope you understand what i mean  it creates a very bad precedent many people claim that it will only be an option and that traditional systems will continue to exist for many years to come and i hope so too but i fear that this situation is the secret wet dream not only for google but sony and probably other big players too  i think of it wrong am i mistaken at some point change my view your response to the post is huge thank you for the great insights im in the process of reading your posts and replying  as well as awarding any deltas wherever needed

cmv getting rid of the plastic straw to ‘help the turtles’ is just a coverup for the much bigger issue of coastal development,now it may be easy to change my view as i don’t really have much data to back me up here the way i think about it is while straws and plastic debris in the ocean is killing turtles it’s also an easy scapegoat now i’m all for getting rid of single use plastics because they pollute our oceans but governments and people are acting like the issue is solved because mcdonald’s has paper straws destruction of turtle nesting areas and coastal development in places like hawaii is destroying the breeding grounds of turtles and killing them before they’re even hatched turtles are forced to go to other beaches which affects the hatch rate and gender of turtles recently as many as 70 of sea turtles are born female due to rising temperatures a few things are being done to protect the nesting grounds of turtles but it’s posed as a much smaller issue than “get metal straw save the environment” when it really just strokes our egos and is not as important  turtle chokes on plastic it gets eaten by something bigger and the cycle continues a turtle nest gets crushed it’s buried forever and no creature on earth benefits from that death  believe that it is government propaganda due to the only thing people care about money it’s cheaper to get rid of plastic than to actually conserve the environment by limiting tourism during nesting season or even just staying off the beach that won’t happen though because money one thing i see against my suggestion is the fact that conserving those beaches means many local people lose their jobs working in coastal tourist attractions and hotels my counter to that is the fact that people lived there before huge companies moved in and they will find a way to live after they leave if you want to live or are born on a tropical island respect your surroundings and don’t destroy habitats just because it’s easier to work in a hotel restaurant than to fish or work in a local shop think i covered everything i wanted to,1,353,2007,127,0.031496062992125984

cmv the 8 to 5 workday in an office m to f in a modern office environment creates more problems than it solves,this has come up recently as my company underwent a merger and my geographically dispersed team who were previously working from home except for travel were suddenly with a months notice required to work in the office if we live within 25 miles of one 8 to 5 mon through friday unless an emergency like sick kid or 2 feet of snow   the 8 to 5 assumes that employees don’t have kids to get off to school in the morning or if they do there is a stay at home parent for coverage which is not realistic for double income households the assumption that everyone takes an hour lunch break  sure some people like to go offsite and get a hot meal or hang out in the cafeteria for an hour but many people can eat lunch in 20 minutes or less while multitasking  i get that having teams colocated in an office may enhance productivity if you can reach out and tap a coworker on the arm for a request that may take an hour going through email but if corporate culture has tools available for constant and reliable communication i don’t see a difference  think that there needs to be a quality of lifequality of work balance and our team has lost several valuable employees due to this new mandate  cmv thank you everyone for your positive feedback and experiences in all of the myriad of workforce in all of the areas that you reside  unfortunately there have been some latecomers to this thread who want to play oppression olympics and i won’t be responding to them  have a great weekend,1,281,1525,113,0.05309734513274336
cmv you can’t expect those working for the minimum wage to do more then minimal work,"i’ll try to keep it short because i can ramble may just be acting like a disgruntled retail employee but this is my view on this not debating minimum wage rates or anything like that i realize even at a living wage a minimum wage salary is just going to get you by not put you in a position to save etc so my point would probably stand despite an increase in minimum wage an employee is being paid what is deemed as the lowest amount legally able to be paid to an employee you can’t expect than the lowest possible effort they can get away with from those employees  lot of minimum wage employees have other things on their mind such as advancing economically they may have a side hustle or be a student both of which are probably way more promising as far bringing them a meaningful career and satisfaction from their work then whatever minimum wage job their currently working being said i totally respect those individuals who give everything their all and will go above and beyond for little or no reward that’s definitely a positive quality for someone to have imo but it’s unrealistic for the average individual raised in american watching countless people make millions off bs to be satisfied living paycheck to paycheck making minimum wage and therefore give maximum effort in position with little possibly of raising the ‘corporate ladder’ and a good chance you’ll be constantly in fear of company restructuring lay offs etc  sum up my point most people unless your one of those fine individuals truly motivated by helping improving thing etc especially those working for minimum wage are solely motivated by money so for a company or even customers of a retail business or any business not motivated by extra tips for good service to think an employee is suppose to be go above and beyond or even really care that much is u realistic and somewhat delusional considering all the factors

cmv china is bad and i dislike the country for its government,"i am a gamer i truly dont care a whole lot about politics i do keep up with some breatuberish people because i like watching their content but my general position is that the us government sucks and it isnt my job to fix it because i want to do other things
 there have been some incidents where gamingentertainment people have been fireddisciplined for going against the political interest of china here are some examples
 

   this one is from a while back when valve was hosting a dota 2 tournament in china and the caster made a joke about being unable to watch porn in china it is fresh in my mind because there was just another ti in china with some drama that said this relates more to the government than the more recent incident with kuku 

 so i dislike china and its government no qualms with the people i feel that they are limit free speech in their own country and combine their political stances with their economythrough propaganda or whatever to force their view on the rest of the world at the very least i prefer governments that can be heavily criticized constantly take america all the europeans ive ever met have strong opinions on all the things we are doing wrong and i would be happy to have them come to america and give a speech about it it is fine america does a lot wrong but we are fairly good at politicsignoring the horrible high profile cases honestly think that one human trying to make money and work in a field heshe likes should not have to watch their mouth about china they suck and are bad money be damned companies have been known to censor something in worldwide releases of their game so china can play it and also have been known to moderate twitch chat and the like so that tiannanmen square is automoderated absolutely ridiculous
 this leads to me thinking china is bad cmv",1,336,2180,62,0.08064516129032258
cmv allowing your child to be overweight should be considered abuseneglect," to clarify this does not apply if your child has a medical condition that affects their weight diet or ability to exercise this is for parents who let their kids eat too much and exercise too little and thus become overweight at a young age  have a lot of emotions about this so i apologize if it’s written poorly basically i was overweight from the time i was about 3 until 18 when i finally started buying my own groceries and being physically active for the first time in my life my parents never taught me about healthy eating or exercising i don’t think i ever even heard them use the word “healthy” they tried putting me in soccer and tball when i was young but i would just sit in the field and pick dandelions because i was chubby and hated running not only was i never being active but i was being fed garbage all the time as well my mom’s cooking usually consisted of chicken fingers fries kraft dinner occasionally spaghetti or shepherd’s pie basically the same comfort food and junk that she grew up on my school lunches were always chalk full of sugary snacks and drinks and things like canned alphagetti pasta and bologna  cheese whiz sandwiches would say my mother was very permissive which is why i had no self control or discipline when it came to over indulging and being lazy i would say no or cry or throw a tantrum and she must’ve let me have my way every time if my weight was any indicator i “didn’t like” cooked vegetables so i always got them raw with ranch dip i didn’t like exercising so i was allowed to watch tv or read or play around inside i was happy doing those things sure but being overweight essentially ruined my self esteem confidence and ability to socialize by the time i was in high school much like other forms of abuse do to a child maybe not as extreme but similar   now 26 and even though i lost a bunch of weight in my early 20’s and developed healthier habits i still struggle with a slight grudge against my parents mostly my mother for letting me go on like that for so long i have my own child now and every day i work hard to break the cycles and not fall into the same parenting habits i was raised with i was bullied about my weight all through elementary school and my mom knew how much it hurt me but not once did she ever sit me down and say “look i know your weight bothers you so let’s try to make some healthier choices and you’ll feel a lot better” or anything like that i’m not sure where my family doctor stood on the issue or if he ever talked to her about it i definitely don’t remember it ever being addressed as a health problem i was just “the fat girl” and that was that feel like because i was so young i shouldn’t have had a choice they should’ve done more if there was some kind of legal action that could be taken in this situation such as classifying it as abuse or neglect maybe she would have tried harder please help cmv  thank you for the overwhelming responses i have some deltas to give out i just wanted to clarify though i posted in cmv because i do not enjoy feeling this way i struggle with it and feel guilty about it all the time which is why i asked for help in changing my view i understand i come across as some entitled slob who never let go of my teen angst but i assure you i am a very sensitive empathetic person and feeling this way about my mom for so long has likely been more detrimental than the extra weight ever was 
she’s the only person i have left and i’ve been working on building a better relationship with her for a long time this issue has just been a hard one for me so thank you all for helping me change my extreme view 2 i’m new to reddit but i understand why it’s so popular now i’m blown away by the intelligence and integrity shown here even those of you who made me feel like a total idiot thank you again  this has been therapeutic in a way and i’m learning a lot",1,758,3979,77,0.05194805194805195

cmv black lives matter the movement and the organization should be treated and judged separately,"after i received a wordless permaban on rselfawarewolves on the subject i believe i thought its a good idea to raise the topic of blm the movement and organization    me preface by saying i highly support the blm movement but i am highly apprehensive of the organization to the point i consider them disparate and at times acting in completely different ends to elaborate the blm organization is very decentralized while the movement prioritizes racial injustice and stresses fighting police abuse the organizations goals appear unfocused leading to disparate postulates depending on a given citys blm chapter for example one of the blm cofounders has admitted to its members being trained marxists and i dont believe people who support blm the movement have signed up to support an anarchist or a marxist political option policy or any poltiical agenda for that matter chicagos blm has cheered for looters while another blm has used blm popularity to ask for extreme defunding the police  not demilitarize or reduce its abuses but scrap it entirely in the name of anarchist agenda another blm asked for reintroduction of artificial racial divides or appropriation of property in the name of black nationalism i dont believe people that support the movement have signed up to support any of these with all due respect some of those postulates appear to have an opposite effect than what people supporting the movement intend while those on the fringe and to the opposite side of the matter are visibly polarized and radicalized the blm organization is conveniently using the movement to shield itself from critique similar to antifa if you criticize antifa you are conveniently branded fascist if you criticize blm you are conveniently branded racist it should not be banned taboo or even politically incorrect to criticize extremists looters violent people or terrorist activities just because they fly the blm banner blm the organization is imo shady about its finances and where its funding comes from in its entirety and where it goes while its unclear where donations to blm go i believe people should be at the very least skeptical of the org until it is verified that blm the movement and blm the organizations goals are aligned  something that i currently highly doubt  
 of the above blm the org has successfully shielded itself from responsibility for any transgressions it is warranted or that of its more extreme members much to the blm movements detriment having little central leadership or unified postulates while sharing the name with the movement makes it not only difficult to hold people responsible but also difficult for the movement that achieved popularity to achieve its broader goals   would change my view is proving the blm organizations actions and goals are aligned with the popular movement and that the organization is worthy of peoples trust to implement them in reality and discuss   my thoughts on the matter are well summarized by terry crews  it also well demonstrates how the organization and the movement is muddled by the interviewer which leads to total misunderstanding of terrys point   2 guys im not here to discuss marxism or the marxist view on the movement i believe the blm movement is disparate from the org in the sense it doesnt support any political option merely is against racial injustice and police abuse whatever the option would be be it leftist or rightist thats the point where i find it straying from the blm movements spirit and ought to be treated separately i find this to be making the discussion go wildly offtopic",1,608,3753,97,0.061855670103092786

cmv separate chess titles given exclusively to women should not exist,first off heres some information for those who are unfamiliar with the chess world chess players are given ratings based on the results of the games theyve played the higher the number is the better the rating for every game played your rating will either increase or decrease depending on your result even for draws but less so for example if a 1000 rated player beats another 1000 rated player then the winner might receive a new rating of 1012 and the loser might receive a new rating of 988 if however the 1000 rated player beat a 2000 rated player then their rating would increase by a larger amount and visa versa are roughly rated between 01400 intermediates are roughly between 14001900 experts very roughly being 1900 order to be awarded a chess title of grandmaster gm your rating has to be 2500 this is unless you are a woman in that case you can receive the title woman grandmaster wgm at 2300 may seem like a small difference on the surface but it is in fact significantly easier to obtain there are roughly 1500 people in the world with a 2500 rating or above whereas there are roughly 15000 people with a 2300 or above lowest female chess title is the women candidate master title which is rewarded at a 2000 rating 2000 is my rating if i was a woman i would have a chess title because i am a male however i will likely never receive a chess title unless i git real gud justifications for the use of separate female chess titles starting from the most stupid to the least stupid women are biologically at a disadvantage in chess is a perspective shared by quite a few high profile gms such as bobby fischer and nigel short showing that you do not in fact have to be smart to be good at chess the common argument is that mens brains are wired to be logical womens brains are wired to be emotional im of the opinion that theres just less female chess players than male ones ive read a couple studies that say females are rated similarly to males but theres just way less of them so of course theres not going to many women at the top if we took away women chess titles there would only be 12 female gms in the world then fuck it then therell only be 12 female gms in the world the rating system is based on an objective system that does not care about gender i want it kept that way its demeaning to give these fake titles women are socially at a disadvantage in chess argument actually has a tiny bit of credibility if you go to a chess tournament you will notice that 99 of the people there are men i can imagine how this could dissuade some women from continuing however you do not make progress in chess purely from chess tournaments its all done online now anonymous chess accounts its so fucking easy i got to 2000 rated just from using anonymous chess accounts online they dont know my gender unless i state it theres so many learning resources to help without making yourself known youtube videos chess books practice online etc that i dont really buy this argument anymore especially as ive never witnessed any kind of sexism at a chess tournament before women should have more female role models in chess i said before it feels like 99 of tournament halls are men this is the case except for children it is much more equal for children i would estimate about a 3070 ratio of girls to boys in fact my very first tournament opponent was against a 10 year old girl who i beat and flexed on her afterwards while she was crying i joke i won but it was very close seems that the number of female chess players will decrease significantly with age theres a number of suggested reasons for this 1 girls are not as interested in the competitive chess arena as much as boys 2 because chess online and in tournament halls are filled with men so they lose interest accept that but is offering chess titles to women barely rated higher than me going to change that no theyve been giving out female chess titles for 70 years now its not working take a fucking hint already it going to make guys like me incredibly salty when they have to pay £40 to enter a tournament when female titled players rated the same as me get to enter for free because of their weakass title yes very much so but why does it even matter its just a title matters because these titles mean a lot to chess players ive seen people cry when receiving a title hell i would cry by giving chess titles to people at my rating it devalues the chess title also you get to enter tournaments for free and win prize funds so its basically a parttime job instead of a hobby when youre titled finally it opens the avenue for online coaching you can brag about it on your cv etc conclusion i know nobody outside of chess cares about this but i also know that if i posted this on rchess i would get downvoted to oblivion seriously all that sub does is downvote so i come to you no knowledge of chess is required to answer this give me a reason why there should be separate female titles this is a footnote from the cmv moderators wed like to remind you of a couple of things firstly please read through our rules if you see a comment that has

cmv if you critically examine the bible like a movie script youd find god as a poorly developed character with inconsistent character traits and unexplained attitudes,"ive been thinking about how horribly the last jedi was written and how inconsistently the characters carried over their personalities from the force awakens and then it hit me what if the bible was examined in the same way thought back to the days where i went to sunday school and learned about god how god is supposed to love humankind to the point where he sends a part of himself jesus to endure physical suffering and make the greatest sacrifice in all of christian history but then it hit me why does god love humans does god choose to love humans if not can god have no choice but to love humans why does god exclusively love humans of course god couldnt exclusively love all humans since he had some humans kill other humans in his name so why choose some humans over others does he choose to love based on who agrees with him and what about the fact that god created humans last it is clear throughout the story of adam and eve that god can grant eternal lifesuffering and take it away in a moments notice this is the conclusion you get with the story of the fall where eve gets tricked by a snake into eating a fruit from the forbidden tree causing humanitys banishment from the garden of eden and subsequent physical suffering we have to endure  if god has the power to granttake eternal life and immunity to suffering why couldnt he create just humans first wouldnt he allow them to be immune to the effects of entropy hunger deterioration in a breathable atmosphere on an earth without anything but them and interact with his creation why did he have to create the other animals and plants first hell why did he even have to create light and a planet he couldve created adam and eve and make them immune to suffering a part of the story in the fall is that god gives adam and eve the capacity to feel shame when they notice that theyre naked they quickly cover themselves up so if he is also able to change the way we feel about certain scenarios another example would be the story of moses where god hardens the pharoahs heart then why couldnt he just create humans first with total immunity to death and without the ability to feel negative emotions in open space creating the animals first makes no sense whatsoever for a creator whose goal is to create something of his own image why would he start off with a lion or a serpent than start off with a human he is very tribal about it seeming to allow us to cause the suffering of his other creations by huntingkillingfarming them he rewards his followers and brings judgment against their enemies he gave his people the land of milk and honey he gave that jerkoff pharoah some desert pyramids and an asswhooping back to the harsh desert from whence he came he wanted these people to be happy because they are on his team yes god is very tribal he specifically chose us to love but he specifically chose to make us last this doesnt make any sense with the gods tribal character trait that is thoroughly described in biblical text why not make us first and just interact with us as he made everything else is this character who is this god that christians follow i need a serious change of view otherwise i could never take a christian seriously which would detriment my personal relationships with my christian friends so please change my view
 
to the best of my understanding the purpose of religious faith is not factual correctness but emotional fulfillment the logical inconsistency of religious faith is in a way similar to the logical inconsistency of an irrational hope or to that of a dream that is to say its there but it doesnt matter that its there other thing to consider is that despite official statements to the contrary in the case of most people their personal faith isnt actually the same thing as believing everything in the bible is 100 true that is their religion may say so and they may themselves believe that they believe everything in the bible but for the purposes of examining logical inconsistencies its an important distinction
 seriously didnt expect such great answers to come in so early this definitely changed my view and outlook on christianity christians arent inherently fools  they simply exercise their human capacity to be invested in something with emotional value my friends are definitely smarter than i am in many ways so i understand that they can be rational their irrational indulgence isnt something to be shamed but an indicator that they can be human this was a very fast cmv thanks ukilkil 2  alright guys thank you all for your lovely responses i mean no offense i do not mean to nor have i insulted you i genuinely appreciate the response but i will have to stop responding and place my attention elsewhere my stoned mind demands other content whether you are christian or atheist i am just happy that we can coexist peacefully 3  ugreatjasoni brought up a very objectively written plot element that actually provided some explanation for why god does certain things and how those could possibly lead us to discovering the truth about gods love there is an ongoing effort for the answer to the legitimacy of gods love that i hope christians will find one day",1,933,5461,170,0.03529411764705882
cmv prisons should be about helping criminals become normal people rather than being about revenge,"alright so before i get into the actual post i feel as if i should clarify a few things 
1 this is my first time posting 
2 i am not american so feel free to call me out if i get anything wrong im european
3 im here to learn okay the point of this post if to see if my opinion is flawed not to prove that my opinion is perfect 
4 sorry for my writing i think that prisons should be about helping criminals become integrated into society in my opinion i feel like there would be a much lower crime rate in the us if instead of treating prisoners badly they were treated nicely that guards talk to them and mental health experts too if you can convince prisoners to stop doing crimes and live like others instead you are basically eliminating crime

 in my opinion if i was in prison then got let out id be much more likely to stop doing crimes if i was treated nicely while i do understand this would mean we would have to spend alot more on prisoners i feel like this would greatly increase the safety of the people just like spending money on the military makes citizens safer so would lowering the amount of criminals in the country  main point should not be treated in a way that causes anger i believe that the reason that the american system does this is revenge they treat them badly because they have treated others badly in my opinion this should not be the way it works i believe that you should not treat them badly if a person who has been bad it doesnt mean that they cant be lead on the right track i believe that all you need to do is help them in my opinion prisoners should be treated in a way that allows them to become a new person there should be mental health professionals who can get them on the right path people who can teach them things so they can get a job companies should be paid to hire some of the prisoners who have had good behaviour and are good at that thing  of course this wont work with everyone but it will most likely help atleast a little  also feel as if a prisoner seems chill and generally a better person they could be let out of course this would probably not realistically be possible as most likely this would cause lots of cases where people would be exploiting the system but id still like to know if there is anything wrong with that idea other than what i just addressed also feel that the cells need to be improved while i dont think they deserve what a normal citizen has i think they definitely should atleast get something that makes them feel as if theyre not in hell but in a place to become a new person

cmv terrorism in the us is not a big deal and trumps ban will have no impact on it,"a lot of people have been bringing up that the countries on trumps ban arent the ones that have people who killed americans in terrorist acts in the us which is valid but id go even further america doesnt have a terrorism problem theres around an average of 10 deaths from terrorism in the us per year how low could we possibly get that in a country with more guns than people assuming a diffuse probability in muslims having a certain chance to commit these acts which again is not the case that is a 1033 million  chance that any given muslim will kill someone through terrorism and if you stopped all muslim immigration which this ban is not even doing that would decrease your chance of death from terrorism by 0000350000 so around 1 more death from terrorism a year this is ignoring the possible increase in terrorism from growing animosity problems with relations between countries the deaths of refugees that we don’t help etc not exactly the change i thought might happen but it turns out that the ban might actually increase the risk of terrorism due to alienation i said trumps ban will have no impact on it it very well could have an impact just probably not the direction wed like

cmv suspects physical appearance and name should be hidden from those who judge them in court,"i think the american justice system and any country but im thinking in the us as the prime example for this could be better if the juryjudges dont know the identity appearance and name of the suspect he or she would be assigned a code name or number ie suspect 1453 and details of his identity would be revealed only when necessary ie suspected of murdering hisher father measure would benefit those that are allegedly usually discriminated in the judicial system ie african americans there are many examples of these cases of unfair treatment circulating on the internet and i think this would eliminate partially our sometimes natural prejudice when presented with accusations like robbery murder or else

 there are so many people living in poverty or barely making ends meet that dont have the luxury of going to the local farmers market to buy local voluntarily paying a higher electric bill to support renwables or biking to work instead of commuting because they cant afford to live a couple miles down the road from their office or dont work in an office and have to drive to constantly changing job sites instead  these things are only accessible for the most privileged of us and are not real solutions to these issues they simply take away resources from real solutions to these problems only way i see the world moving forward is to make renewables as cheap and reliable as fossil fuels  car manufacturers need to release reliable and inexpensive electric cars trucks and public transport  governments and industry need to invest massive amounts of money into developing solarwind plus storage solutions that are as reliable and inexpensive as natural gas  these are the only solutions that can actually be implemented worldwide to combat carbon emissions  otherwise we will simply end up with western democracies and china half heartedly investing in a more expensive electric grid while the rest of the world continues to burn coal natural gas and oil",1,344,2070,186,0.021505376344086023

cmv prison rape jokes are disgusting and not funny,this belief partially started from when i asked a theoretical question here about how would college students arrested for underage drinking be treated in jail since people often talk about what crime you commit determines your treatment in jail and underage drinking is an arrestable offense in many places  responses include comments like here and here which were both rape jokes  comments also show both how american culture believes that prison rape is frequently a laughing matter and how disgusting prison rape jokes are such jokes are disgusting because it makes being sexually assaulted in prison something that should be expected or normal as such abuse is not taken seriously this stems from the problem that people treat inmates in prison as people who are lesser beings who deserve zero respect the fact is we are all humans if it is not funny for your neighbor to be abused the same should apply to people in prison  addition such jokes arent funny because they are flat out ignorant and gross in the example comments i talked about above both of them are comments that joke about college students being treated as sexual objects in jail it is not funny for someone to be treated as a sexual object these jokes are also flat out wrong because the question had to do with jail and not prison and such sexual abuse is rare in jail someone arrested for drugs or alcohol would not be treated poorly in jail or prison these jokes make it impossible to reform the system because people are so used to being ignorant of reality due to popularity of such jokes,1,277,1920,51,0.0784313725490196
cmv you should be able to enjoy life while working hard rather than after, many hear and often preach the phrase “work hard play hard” but we also hear the importance of maintaining a “worklife balance” is the perfect “worklife balance” does this mean continuously maintaining a 9to5 job and being able to spend quality time with loved ones afterward does this mean getting 8 hours of sleep attending all classes participating in extracurriculars and leaving time to take care of yourself and is this definition of a worklife balance realistic according to research from the harvard medical school it was found that working more than 55 hours per week significantly raises the risk of heart attack and stroke and these individuals are more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression in addition to loss of sleep loss of sleep can be easily perpetuated if hard work and maintaining other responsibilities of life are prioritized   hard play hard usually implies that one should spend an abundance of effort in their work and maintain a hardworking mindset until success is reached but then i raise the question what is success how do you know when you reach it especially for myself it’s very easy to get lost in the busyness of life and forget to enjoy life for what it has to offer but then i wonder when do you know you should “play hard” do i deserve to enjoy myself when i have an abundance of work to do  both “work hard play hard” and “worklife balance” seemingly conflict in meaning i believe that a combination of the two meanings is the best way to go about life i think being successful in your work means putting quality effort to learn from your experiences every day rather than simply attaining some professionalworkrelated goal and by doing so we can create time to let loose and in a sense celebrate ourselves for being productive in our daily lives thus this balanced mindset to life is working hard and playing hard in sync  one just continues to work hard in hopes of playing hard in the distant future they may never reap the fruits they sow never pause to appreciate that life has more to offer than just working school or a job or at least give their mind and body a break from life on the flip side if you always go out and don’t prioritize productivity and working how can you sustain a life for yourself how can you contribute to society and make your life meaningful is why i think we should at least try and maintain both aspects of life at the same time is there a better alternative to this mindset,1,445,2622,75,0.05333333333333334

cmv kneeling during the national anthem is not disrespectful to america veterans or really anyone at all,for a little background this is a topic my view has been evolving on for some time when professional athletes first started kneeling during the national anthem a few years ago my opinion was more along the lines of i respect your right to peacefully protest but i disagree with your actions and find them disrespectful to veterans who fought and died to give us the freedoms we have today i still have the utmost respect for our veterans i personally know a more than a couple veterans and have seen firsthand the toll it takes on them and their families i now think the idea that simply taking a knee during the national anthem is somehow disrespectful to them or the country as a whole is misguided one there are far more disrespectful things a person could do during the anthem than kneeling would it not be a more disrespectful yet equally peaceful protest for someone to turn their back to flag during the anthem or to try to shout over it even more those more disrespectful measures would be protected by the first amendment rights to the freedom of speech and the freedom to peacefully assemble and petition the government for a redress of grievances so why the uproar over simply kneeling why should kneeling be considered disrespectful at all for a personal example but one that should be familiar to most anyone who has watched or participated in team sports in america at any level of competition i played american football all the way through junior high and high school whenever a player on either team was injured every player on both teams whether on the field or the sideline would take a knee until that player left the field in that context kneeling was a sign of respect this may be getting a little metaphorical but i dont believe its a stretch to say that our country is injured right now should it not be a sign of respect to kneel for our injured country apologies for the messy deltaing couldnt get a welldeserved one to go through pretty sure i got it straightened out,1,359,2066,107,0.12149532710280374

cmv mass shootings are a poor justification for gun control,"my concern is that mass shootings get more attention from the gun control movement than they objectively deserve and this distracts from the kind of regulations that would reduce gun murders mass shootings get a lot of attention in the news media because they are exciting but they dont actually kill that many people  eg in 2017 117 people died in mass shootings out of 14542 total gun murders  08
2 the pathology of mass shootings is atypical they are mostly carried out by lone individuals who have spent some time stockpiling weapons and building themselves up to carry out a fantasy of destruction against some institution or group there is an eerie impersonality to their violence the particular people they kill are just extras in the screenplay they are trying to produce this may be what makes mass shootings so upsetting  they can happen to anyone even nice middleclass white people minding their own business in the mall
3 in contrast most gun violence takes place within poor badly policed gangridden edited to add ethnic minority neighborhoods in parts of cities like detroit and chicago it tends to be much more personal and is mostly carried out with illegally owned handguns not legally owned ar15s
4 focusing so much on mass shootings makes it seem that if only we could stop the wrong people from getting hold of ar15s we would reduce gun violence by a lot it wouldnt
5 focusing so hard on which guns people who follow the laws should be allowed to buy really pisses off the community of gun owners who are less likely than the average population to commit crimes that makes it harder than it ought to be to build a political consensus for effective gun control edit there are millions of ar15s in legal ownership but very very few get used for mass murder
6 effective gun control isnt just about laws most guns that kill people are already illegal but policies that implement them eg national database of gun buyers to prevent straw buyers funnelling guns into cities and also better funded detective squads so that gun murderers get punished some us cities now have only a 35 clear up rate thats what the gun control movement should focus on thanks for taking the time to challenge my view i maintain the broad outlines but i was persuaded to add a lot more nuance i posted the result here",1,406,2617,60,0.06666666666666667

krassenstein of my facebook friends are liberal than conservative and in general id say i agree with the post my post  question is is this meme accurate or propaganda how so i think the five mass shootings in the last five days refers to

cmv we need to change the way the world views pedophilia in the sense that we need to view the problem as an illness rather than a purposeful crime,"my basis on this argument is that pedophilia is as much an illness as your depression or other mental disorder lot of people who are sexually attracted to children dont choose to be it is simply how they feel and have zero control over it have come over several people online who have had sexual attraction to underage kids and feel like monsters they hate themselves for it and how they even could have thoughts like these this is however anecdotal yet i feel like it sets the basis of my opinion people would never admit these feelings out of fear of being an outcast families and friends would avoid them they would find it hard to get jobs and would be treated like monsters if they felt it was safe to be honest about these feelings without the fear of becoming ostracised than maybe they would come forward more often to seek help hidden and not dealt with these emotions could result in using child pornography or even sexually abusing a child themselves reason we classify things as mental disorders is because it does not fit our societal expectations or understandings is the same reason that homosexuality was seen as abnormal and deemed as a mental illness and it wasnt that long ago that transgenderism was seen as another mental illness people need to be seen as humans and helped before they do something they will regret have been meaning to make this post for a while but felt it seemed fitting now with kevin spaceys allegations coming into light this all have been prevented if he got the necessary help in the first place i dont know but i would like to think it would be a step in the right direction point pedophilia is an illness and should be treated as such not a purposeful desire to harm

cmv 1ply is inferior to 2ply toilet paper and shouldn’t exist,"
disclaimer this is my one crackpost for the month and i apologize in advance  know it’s an odd thing to get a little stuck on but i’ve found myself thinking about this for the past few nights  the “folding” versus “wadding” community is nearly even folding tends to be the one that stays in a constant lead with this in mind i have a few reasons that i believe 1ply toilet paper is absolute trash  toilet paper is very thin this thinness normally makes it horrible for absorbency and easy to tear which can lead to more toilet paper being pulled in the bathroom i would estimate that you would pull 4 1ply sheets for every 2 2ply sheets  correlate with my first thought if you’re going through 1ply paper at a quicker rate than you would 2ply paper then you are paying extra money for worst services would you pay 10 every week for a new pack of paper or 10 biweekly for a new pack of paper few 1ply toilet papers are a good quality if you’re buying 1ply for cheapness you probably aren’t buying name brand which means you might as well be stealing toilet paper from the sketchy gas station down the street  only positive i have heard about 1ply toilet paper is that it is less likely to clog your septic system i would state that this could even out that cost value however i’ve also heard that toilet paper clogging the septic system is a myth as toilet paper’s main purpose is to go into the septic system after waste cleanup most toilet papers are tested for septic safety before they are marketed  this is more of a personal thing but as a lady i’ve got to wipe three times urine feces period mess as much as a dude and would much rather prefer quality over quantity i don’t know if dudes will be able to empathize or understand the horror of possibly getting all three of those bodily fluidssolids on my hand due to a worthless thinass sheet of toilet paper problem",1,355,1960,65,0.07692307692307693
cmv left and right are outdated terms that no longer define the current ideological spectrum,"every generation that grows and becomes politically active goes further away of the classic left and right definitions and mixing things of both sides is increasingly common we still have polarized sides and one is clearly leaned to the left and the other to the right but i feel this words no longer encapsulate the real difference between both sides
each country has slightly different concepts of left and right and probably most countries have two sides politically speaking im my country we have many political parties spreaded along the left  right spectrum but as polarized politics are increasingly the norm two sides end up against each other every time and we join people of the same left or right tendency because its the reasoning we were taught to follow but isnt there a better modern view of what people really think and want this day and age i really dont think that this definition helps only worsens the polarization and ignorance",1,162,972,94,0.0425531914893617
cmv transgendered individuals have serious and legitimate mental problems and they deserve clinical help to reverse their dysmorphia,being trans leads people to take extreme amounts of hormones drastic measures and mutilating surgery all to blend in as the gender that they would like to be and its rarely successful the rate of suicide and attempted suicide for these individuals is absurdly high even after transitioning they need actual help not blind acceptance as socially uncomfortable as that may make people i believe that we as a societal whole are coming at this issue the wrong way and its causing suffering my half brother has been transitioning to a female for years now and hes always been horribly depressed even now that hes been passable for some time being said you can live your life however you wish as long as it doesnt negatively impact anyone else but there should at least be a viable solution for them to turn to mind changed people are looking at the root cause but havent found a cure or a reason yet because the brain is immensely complicated and our current technology has only allowed researchers to move at current speads the current treatments as extreme as they seem to me ease the suffering of trans individuals and shouldnt be ignored even if they arent a 100 fix,1,207,1211,134,0.029850746268656716
cmv rappers shouldn’t be obsessed with diamonds considering where most diamonds come from,first i’d like to say i am a huge rap fan so i’m not coming at this idea as an outsider i like flashy chains and designer clothes as well and i don’t think that materialism is the issue here just the fact that most diamonds are mined by enslaved africans  i think it’s interesting how rappers seem to be obsessed with diamonds and those same diamonds potentially come from their distant enslaved african relatives everyone knows how disgusting the diamond trade is in african and unless rappers like the migos who have no exaggeration probably 10 millions worth of diamonds between them specifically source non slave trade diamonds i don’t get how this doesn’t impact them morally if i can afford them one day i’ll probably have a nice classy diamond necklace or something because i like jewelry too but i’m going to ensure those diamonds didn’t come from african slaves  hope nothing i said was offensive and i’m interested in what you guys have to say about it i feel like this is something that has’t been posted on here before i don’t mean to make it seem like all rappers are african american more so rap was originated by very conscious african americans and i would expect any race rapper to respect african and african american culture and not want to partake in anything negatively contributing to africa or anywhere a historically oppressed people come from i thank everyone who responded with thought out and educated responses i did learn a bunch and awarded deltas to those with good comments however to the pc easily triggered white people the racist accusations are pathetic this was simply a post to discuss a thought i’m not a racist i don’t think africans and american black people are the same i feel like anyone with a brain would have realized that just had to give a big fu to pc wannabe racist reddit vigilantes thanks again to those with good comments my view on this has been changed peace,1,341,1979,90,0.16666666666666666

cmv its 2020 so theres no excuse anymore for popular apps to not be available on both ios and android phones,i believe that if an app developer has an app on the app store they should also work towards releasing that app on the google play store as well obviously if theres a specific reason its only meant for ios then fine if the app isnt popular enough for it to make sense for them to spend the money to develop the app then fine 10 or so years ago it was super common for apps to only be on the app store as someone who grew up with android i felt cheated out of certain apps or games i wanted  its become easier in the past decade to create apps and release them to the public for the most part apps do have both apple and android versions however there are still apps that are only available on ios that i would like to download eg procreate and it just doesnt make sense at this point  please no comments about whether apple or android are superior or whatever both phones have pros and cons have awarded deltas based on the concept of opportunity cost between iphones and androids and on the concept that android tablets arent nearly as popular as ipads my view has not completely been changed however a new take that i have is that even if procreate doesnt make an app for android tablets they could release a version of procreate pocket for android phones which are about as popular as apple phones or another option id accept is for them to release a version for windows due to the wide availability of touch screen laptops from them   a lot of comments are from solosmall developers who say that it would be difficult for them to personally make an app for both platforms thats understandable my post is more about the larger app companies whose job it is to createmaintain apps hope that cleared things up  someone brought to my attention that the specific company i am talking about in my example savage interactive is not as big of a company as some sources ive seen make it seem i awarded a delta to them because i can see why it may take more effort to produce an app for multiple platforms if there arent many people they only have 17 but i still think its a project they should work towards due to the popularity of the app also they say on their site they are hiring which means they are looking for more team members and can afford to hire more imo they should hire people who have android or windows experience  omg okay yall i get it its not something they decided is financially a good decision lol ive awarded a delta to a user who explained to me that apple users spend more than android users and that the company has decided its not worth it to develop,1,492,2691,113,0.07964601769911504
cmv when the woke left dismiss people like joe rogan and call him altright it turns more moderate left people away because they know that isnt true,"i have noticed there is a lot terrible things said about rogan because he platforms these people i also know rogan has a huge audience and theyre not just a bunch of crazy altrighters when you hear joe talk about his own views he actually sits very left of center  seems to me that when people dismiss joe and label him this way it makes a lot of his audience who knows where he actually stands think that these people are overreacting and are too extreme point being that by doing this they are actually hurting their cause and excluding many people they actually agree with making less people support the rest of their ideas  there are more examples that could be used but i felt rogan was a good place to start since he does have a massive audience

cmv i would rather vote for a third party candidate that is closer to my political standings rather than the lesser of two evils,"when i registered to vote at 18 i registered as a democrat without being fully aware of what the party platform was and its recent history i knew i agreed with democrats more than republicans and decided i was a democrat im 24 now and have learned a lot since then i have also realized since then that i am very far left of the democratic party should be about having a voice for your opinions and having a two party system keeps many people voting for what they would consider the lesser of two evils instead of voting for someone they actually agree with im far left of the democratic party and think hillary clinton is doing a lot of things i find morally wrong i have read through her website multiple times and disagree with a lot of what she wants to do and why she wants to do it trump seems like he would be a horrible president and is way too vague when it comes to what he wants to do even with the vagueness i strongly disagree with his plans if he becomes the president  in the us has been a two party system for almost its entire history and i think thats horrible im far left of both parties and would rather vote my conscious with someone that has a political stance closer to mine 
 peoples argument against this is but imagine trump as president yes i agree that would not be a good thing but i also feel that hillary would not represent me or my beliefs although i would consider hillary clinton as the lesser of two evils only by a little she is still far right of what i would want in my president thanks for all of the responses this is a great community  subreddit im trying my best to get to each comment but you guys are posting a lot faster than i can read and reply especially with all of the well thought out and detailed replies seriously though thank you for the great conversations 2 to clarify something i dont expect any third party candidate to win voting third party would just be a vote for someone i believe in which is part of democracy 3 not too relevant in the overall discussion but i saw a few comments saying that my views are center right  940am and i havent gone to sleep yet so im going to go to bed ill read more responses later thank you all for the great discussions even though i wasnt a part of most of them

simply put the dude was paid more for being next to useless and as result guess who was coming with a good solution the employees in the team who was taking most of the credit the next to useless dude just because you know hes been a manager for 10 years already in 3 different corporations therefore he must have such skills but at the end you know how they say  those who cant do teach

cmv the entire commercial air travel business thrives on purposefully making your experience bad so that they can charge for upgrades,"while most businesses become successful by creating good service and products  and getting paid for these good services and good products  the commercial airline industry seems to be trying to make money by creating the most miserable experience possible and rewarding customers with slight comparable conveniences for paying additional money in industries where everything sucks there is always an effort by other companies to make things better and to compete with others  as far as airlines go they all really suck and no ones doing anything about it except for minuscule differences the points below and tell me it doesn’t sound like someone maliciously just trying to inconvenience everyone for upgrade payments  these inconveniences illustrate how something can easily be done to improve customer experience yet years are going by with no change	all research suggests that even boarding passengers in random order is more efficient than the stupid grouping systems in place  yet no company does anything about it  they make you pay to upgrade your group zone number so that you can just sit on the plane instead of the gate and still wait the same amount of time
2	aisles are only big enough for one person so everyone has to wait 30 mins to board and unboard  i’m not an engineer but making an aisle 2people’s length instead of 1 does not destroy its aerodynamic abilities
3	they only have overhead compartment space for literally just 80 of people  we’ve achieved safe ways to literally fly across the globe but it’s impossible to load everyone’s bag
4	“customers” sit shoulder to shoulder with no room to stretch for 6 hours
5	bathrooms are so incredibly small that you can’t even extend your arms
6	passengers need to climb over each other if they are not in an isle seat
7	you get a bag of pretzels and a soda can instead of sandwiches or any other cheap food item
8	wifi is fast enough to load pages but not fast enough to be remotely worth it
9	cheap car seats are more comfortable than airline seats
9	the suitcases are stored in a separate section of the plane so entire building structures filled with carousels need to be made where wait times are up to an hour and bags get lost and customers need to go somewhere else to get them are not competing for business apart from simply adding two bags of pretzels instead of one bag of pretzels if an airline made an experience that doesn’t suck by implementing reasonable measures it would run the competition out of business   gas isn’t fun but at least gas stations put tv’s in the stations and add chips and drinks to make customers choose one over another  computers all used to suck before apple came and made them desirable  where is the apple of air travel commercial air travel is not a service industry they are a disservice industry with the added side effect of travel to clarify experiences like firstclass and airport lounges are great in comparison to not first class and standard gates  however the standard for everyone should just be similar to first class with a comfortable seat and some hot food  it shouldn’t be a luxury  instead they make the normal experience terrible just so that people upgrade to “ok” my view thanks

cmv the power of magic has caused people born into the wizarding world in harry potter to lack critical thinking and problem solving skills,the ability to use magic in the harry potter universe has allowed for creative solutions to a lot of problems that people face however i believe that using magic to solve problems has caused people born into the wizarding world to be unable to think through basic problems well themselves instead solving a problem is just knowing the name and wand movement of a spell that will take care of things this reliance has bled into how people navigate all situations that dont have an obvious or magical solution been going back through the entire plot mostly by listening to the podcast mostly nitpicking do a full movie series run and have noticed how a lot of characters lack what people typically consider common sense in a lot of situations the character who does seem to know everything in every situation is one who was born and raised entirely isolated from magic hermione i think a lot of what makes her studious nature so unique is that she actually wants to understand things and how to deal with unexpected circumstances while people born into magic arent worried about figuring things out for themselves real life analogy to this could be comparing a student who came from a privileged background and had others like their parents do things for them versus a student who didnt have this luxury and needed to do more for themselves a student who never needed to do things on their own typically struggles more with critical thinking than their peers because theyre used to having other people do that for them in harry potter those born into magic face a similar problem as a result of magic replacing the need to do many things themselves seems to be most apparent with the three main characters ron the only character who has relied on magic to accomplish basic tasks for his entire life is shown to be less independent in his thinking to have less initiative and to look like an absolute dunce when a solution isnt obvious meanwhile harry and hermione take initiative for themselves much more frequently and are able to reach solutions themselves this is a small sample size admittedly and im using it more as an example than as proof  can see how the ability to use magic to help with things can foster more creative thinking and promote problem solving skills but i dont think that plays out in the people in the universe instead magic is hamstringing most witches and wizards ability to think effectively for themselves,1,427,2491,141,0.0425531914893617

cmv america is the corrupted enterprise eisenhower warned about,"other than the sections of the speech below i think i can summarize my view shortly i served for just about 5 years in the navy as an officer over two deployments i shifted my view from one where the united states was ultimately a force for good to one where the united states is at base a hammer constantly looking for nails i was repeatedly disabused of my ideals of american foreign policy by the lackluster ideas of the senior officials i spoke with and the incompetent logic of the few admirals i had the luck to get into lecture rooms with one exceptionally frightening experience was listening to a 90minute lecture from an admiral on his belief that within a decade we would be in a shooting war with china this lecture was given in 2015 short from these experiences and spending two extended maintenance periods in navy shipyards swimming with contractors i believe that americas foreign policy is no longer a force for good that an unwarranted influence exists between the military and its consequent industries and our government and that we do not have an alert and knowledgeable citizenry steering a proper meshing of the military industry and our societys peaceful proliberty goals my belief is that americans no longer have the ability to extract ourselves from the state of constant war that we presently have we will continue to expand our involvement internationally so that an era of peace will never again exist in the united states where all of our troops will be at home excepting our international bases and there wont be a looming clock of regularly planned interventionist deployments condensed the speech reads as follows full speech here 

    despite these holocausts america is today the strongest the most influential and most productive nation in the world understandably proud of this preeminence we yet realize that americas leadership and prestige depend not merely upon our unmatched material progress riches and military strength but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment
    progress toward these noble goals is persistently threatened by the conflict now engulfing the world it commands our whole attention absorbs our very beings we face a hostile ideology global in scope atheistic in character ruthless in purpose and insidious in method unhappily the danger it poses promises to be of indefinite duration
    
    a vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment our arms must be mighty ready for instant action so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction
    our military organization today bears little relation to that known by any of my predecessors in peacetime or indeed by the fighting men of world war ii or korea
    until the latest of our world conflicts the united states had no armaments industry american makers of plowshares could with time and as required make swords as well but now we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions added to this three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment we annually spend on military security more than the net income of all united states corporations
     the total influence  economic political even spiritual  is felt in every city every state house every office of the federal government we recognize the imperative need for this development yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications our toil resources and livelihood are all involved so is the very structure of our society
    in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the militaryindustrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
    we must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes we should take nothing for granted only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together
    partly because of the huge costs involved a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity for every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers
    the prospect of domination of the nations scholars by federal employment project allocations and the power of money is ever present  and is gravely to be regarded
    another factor in maintaining balance involves the element of time as we peer into societys future we  you and i and our government  must avoid the impulse to live only for today plundering for for our own ease and convenience the precious resources of tomorrow we cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without asking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage we want democracy to survive for all generations to come not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow just wanted to put this link here because a few people got into it with me about whether or not the dod budget was too large they argued that military spending has been declining versus gdp for decades i pointed out that the public does not know the actual spending on the military because specops stuff is sometimes made secret and disappears from the budget i linked a wapo article from 2015 its down there in my responses and today an article comes out about effectively legalizing hiding the military budget from the public hiding the dod budget made legal",1,975,6064,64,0.078125
cmv patients should always be offered the ability to record themselves during procedures that use amnesia type drugs,"had to take my last one down because of the wording    a patient is placed under a cocktail of drugs that effect their memory there should be a direct proactive option for them to record it     
      
it is understood these can be recorded upon request but this places physicians and staff at a level they feel personally attacked it upsets some of them to a point they will not provide any additional services for comfort and recovery beyond what they are allowed to withhold    
this is not an unusual request thrown into the mix that would be too tedious to add this is an option that would benefit all patients in this scenario they even proactively ask if sentimental jewelery is requested in the or        
          
and i also realize major operations are heavily monitored  but even the minor operations should be recorded for the patient for a fee you are taking away someones memories         
        
if someone reacts poorly to something because their comorbidities were overlooked or just ignored as irrelevant this could easily be erased from their memories and not a word spoken of it any lapses of memory they do have from it pushed aside as hallucinations                  people do have conditions that make the setting of general anesthesia to be pretty traumatizing and many have no recollection and no one speaks a word of it to maintain a cleaner record and it just keeps happening      
             
           
i believe most doctors are only doing what is best for the patient but i also realize there are some that would rather drug the patient than admit fault there are some that do not have the patients best interest at heart this is important this is your life vs someones misplaced ego or direct carelessness for an alternative motive          
         
  i believe police are far more capable of direct malice than doctors they do have body cams and a good handful have been known to physically do anything to stop the recording of themselves because it feels like a personal attack on them its human nature to feel threatened by the request of being recorded when its not a typical scenario some doctors understand and dont mind this at all but unfortunately some are still very offended by this and if the patient was instead offered this scenario of bias wouldnt exist",1,504,2370,118,0.03389830508474576
cmv in the us conservative media is just as mainstream as liberal media and its dishonest to try and claim that liberal media has control of the narrative,edit im starting to get flooded with replies and have no hope of replying to everyone or addressing every point of view being expressed but i am still reading everything so dont let that discourage you from replying i did give a delta to a poster who convinced me that an overwhelming majority of professional journalists are democrat but my opinion is not entirely changed the rules of this sub say to award deltas even if your opinion is only slightly changed  im still trying to encourage discourse but i dont want people to get the idea that im walking back every single point ive made so far  the world of cable news its no secret that fox news is alone  however viewership numbers show that fox gets more eyeballs on the screen than cnn and msnbc combined from this alone i believe its dishonest to say that mainstream conservative media doesnt exist talk radio is another thing altogether  go down the list of mostlistenedto talk radio and you see that sean hannity rush limbaugh glenn beck etc get several million listeners every week and meanwhile the first liberal personality is at   below about 8 programs that are explicitly conservative podcast numbers tell a less compelling story but ben shapiro is still at  in a sea of apolitical or moderate shows media is another realm where id say conservative talking points are in the mainstream although one of those talking point is how liberal social media sites are though i dont have numbers to back them up  my point is that the idea that mainstream media is exclusively liberal is a myth and there is plenty if not more evidence that conservative media has just as much if not more sway on the population,1,302,1767,161,0.037267080745341616
cmv once all sentencing conditions have been met criminal records should be sealed and only available to law enforcementjudicial system and not open to prospective employers with limited exceptions,as a felon your options for sustainable and lucrative employment are severely limited most employers simply are not willing to take a chance on hiring felons and this has resulted in a marginalized attitude to those that have paid their debt to society  there should be exceptions for those applying for more sensitive type positions such as those who work with children or whose position might require a government security clearance outside of that i think we as a society are totoo discriminatory towards felons and thus should remove that barrier entirely,1,93,577,201,0.01990049751243781
cmv reprised there needs to be an even number of chuggas over two before a choo choo,"a reprisal of my sixmonthold cmv post if this is considered as a repost then i apologize in advance but thanks to the thread i have since nuanced my opinion on the subject to be more inclusive got into a friendshipruining debate the other day with my exbestfriend  
  
i was hanging out in his house while he was babysitting his little brother who was playing with one of those toy train sets the little kid audibly mutters  
  
kid chugga chugga chugga chugga choo choo  
  
me you should add four more chuggas before the choo choo  
  
friend no he doesnt four sounds good enough  
  
and that was the story of how me and my best friend parted ways to live our own lives  
  
no im not really sweating about the whole ordeal not everyone can be right like me but its been bugging me ever since 5 years ago and i was just reminded about it when i saw this xkcd comic by the way its fucking 16 nas before batman and not 8 jesus christ i might have to argue about this next now  
  
i feel like maybe ive been brought up wrong and im conditioned to think differently to others but what do you guys think am still not convinced that any ol wouldbe 7 yo train conductor could spout a random number of chuggas and there is an objective rhythmic quality to the line i have since evolved to hold the position that any even number over two will suffice but those who use odd numbers are still completely wrong we finally unite this country under universal agreement or will this further increase the division between the already partisan party lines april fools",1,306,1780,91,0.08791208791208792

cmv transgenders will never be the biological sex they wish they were,okay my opinions are a tad complicated firstly i believe gender is simply a list of stereotypical traits weve assigned to one sex or the other secondly transgender people will never be the sex they choose to be from a strictly biological perspective obviously you cant change your chromosomes but also obviously no one knows which mix of chromosomes one has and it doesnt particularly matter on a surface level however you can turn your dick inside out and snip your nuts off all you want and inverted dick is still a dick you still have xy chromosomes presumably thats not to say i dont have sympathy for those who are transgender i do it sounds like hell and im sorry you dont have the body you feel like inside and thats also not to say i dont support having srs hrt etc your body your life do what makes you happy think of it in terms of hyperbole however and heres where my failure to understand comes into play lets say i identify as spiderman put aside the fact that hes a fictional character and that identifying as spiderman is inherently very silly i identify as spiderman i wake up every day wishing i was spiderman that i had super agility strength and could stick to walls all the traits a spiderman has sure i could build webshooters design a cool costume with mini hairs that help me stick to walls despite all of that i will never biologically speaking be a spiderman i will never have a spiders dna spliced with my own what makes the spiderman premise incredibly silly and the other not so why is identifying as something seemingly more important than biological fact aside from blah blah blah female brain blah blah why is one an unhealthy delusion but the other seemingly notso in recent years this is more of a helpmeunderstand but that sub only has 7 followers appreciate the platinum 2 the point of my spiderman analogy is its purposefully filled with straw to indicate the level of absurdity i used to think of the concept of changing genders secondly my use of transgenders was my attempt at shorthand for transgender people no disrespect was intended 3 all this talk of spiderman makes me want to give being spiderman a shot lol,1,389,2281,70,0.05714285714285714
cmv when you move to a new country you should want to assimilate,people often claim it’s racist to suggest that people who move to a country should integrate  with the culture they’ve moved to i think that it’s perfectly reasonable to expect that they do this isn’t to suggest that they cannot hold on to their previous identities or speak their mother tongue language to people who also speak it or practice their religious values but they should want to adopt some of the culture exists in their new country  chose to move to a new country and it shouldn’t be surprising that people find some things like the fact that they won’t learn the language or they talk down on the culture a bit annoying this in no way means that they should be harassed or mistreated for it though  just don’t understand why it’s something people view as racisxenophobic  when i say integrate i don’t mean giving up things like their native food or likes and dislikes but rather learning to speak the language of their area or trying to respect the cultural values of their surrounding area the goal should be that you want to combine your cultures,1,193,1096,65,0.046153846153846156
cmv the united states is a very racially tolerant country,this position will necessarily be stated in comparative terms i can certainly imagine some post racial colorblind society compared to which america would look positively dystopian but compared to whats reasonable to expect a country to be in 2020 by comparing the us to other contemporary nations i think were actually a very racially tolerant country  it should be noted that our citizens are about as racially tolerant as they come some countries are our equal in this regard but none are really notably our betters most americans support diversity and again were one of the global leaders in that regard and our police forces often derided as extremely racist might actually be less racist than our not very racist general public or at least more able to repress whatever racial bias they do possess  like blm can give the impression that race relations are very poor in this country but id actually argue the opposite the mere fact that the vast majority of americans support blm and that tens of millions of us are willing to take to the streets in its names is proof of how deeply americans care about stamping out racism the fact that up to 15 of americans some 50000000 people are willing to go so far as abolishing the police entirely to help combat a tiny amount of police shootings that might have been racially motivated is frankly quite astonishing indeed im unaware of any other country that has dedicated as much social media and academic time and interest to studying the issue of racism in our society and how to best combat it one gets the impression that if black lives truly did not matter in the united states there would be no blm because nobody would give a shit about racial injustice  instead most people here do and im unaware of any analogous movements in any other country protesting the racial injustices that occur there if we truly were a deeply racist white supremacist nation then blm would have never gotten off the ground  there are racial injustices elsewhere racial disparities in things like wealth incarceration infant mortality etc are rampant across similar developed nations like the uk australia and canada as well as many countries that scored as just as racially tolerant across south america obviously such disparities are even more egregious in less tolerant countries like india did any of those countries start a blm type movement not that im aware of certainly none as large or notable or passionate the kneejerk reaction to that fact is to assume thats because racism is a worse problem in the us but perhaps its just because americans are more aware of our racist problems and more dedicated to fighting against them  obviously its asinine to think racism is over just because obama got elected but that fact shouldnt be trivialized either yes america has only had one minority commander in chief but thats one more than pretty much all our contemporaries can boast wheres the ethnically indian british pm wheres the native american leader of canada  while i do fully understand that we often focus on much more significant racial issues in this country the mere fact that we have the time and luxury to devote massive amounts of social attention to issues like the number of black oscar winners not precisely matching up with the demographics of the country indicates just how good race relations are in this country its fairly hard for me to imagine a deeply racist white supremacist nation giving a flying fuck about how many awards famous rich black hollywood elites are getting  often said that we need to have more conversations about race but do we granted ive only been around for a few decades but for as long as ive been aware it seems like were absolutely obsessed with the topic we talk about it all the time black history and various related racial injustices are major topics in us schools there have been countless articles and studies and books written about these topics documentaries and movies made special interest groups minority caucuses affirmative action grants and scholarships apologies have been issued and reparations paid tens of trillions of dollars and god knows how many man hours spent combating racial inequalities  not my view that just because i believe america is a very racially tolerant country that racism is therefore solved and there are no social frontiers worth fighting for i also fully recognize that arguably the only reason that were as racially tolerant as we are now is due to the heroic efforts of civil rights activists both past and present but i do reject the fatalistic defeatist depressing race baiting narratives of bestselling authors like tanehisi coates who paint a grim picture of an indelibly deeply and inescapably racist american nation  my view signing off for a bit will try to get back on later 20 whokay ive got about 70 essay length replies in my inbox awarded a few deltas and still trying to get to new responses but theres no way in hell ill be able to get to all these if youre looking to challenge my view i might suggest addressing one of the many people who are itt

cmv i support donald trump,in light of the recent massive online outcry against trump i want to once more reflect on the validity of my views during the election cycle i came to respect trump even if i could see his flaws the arguments i saw for himhis positions were generally logical and well reasoned while the arguments against him were ad hominems personal stories and otherwise emotional in nature any time i questioned things i was called a racist and a bigot even though for most of my life i considered my views liberal the election cycled saw me switching to the trump train on the recent immigration issue while i dont think it will particularly stop terrorism or that terrorism is a threat currently i do think it shows trumps commitment to preventing a situation like the one in europe the initial green card situation was unfortunate but from what i have seen was quickly solved in addition i see no reason why noncitizens regardless of what theyve gone through should feel entitled to enter the us yes it would be nice to help people but realistically the world is filled with people who are suffering even in our own country and we should be smart with who and how we help  hold a similar view on something like the wall i dont think it will even close to eliminate illegal immigration and it wont even stop the main source of illegal immigration however it will stop some illegal immigration and from what ive seen the cost is relatively minimal terms of bringing jobs back i think its a simple concept that if things can be done cheaper outside the us without any downside they will be done elsewhere i dont know how successful trump will be but i believe free trade deals will only hurt the average american worker  for diplomacy given the uss economic and military power i dont see how trump can hurt us relations dictators and horrible regimes across the globe are worked with because of the resources they have and from a purely statistical standpoint i dont think the us can be ignored i have no doubts some in the international community will hate trump but others will like him and regardless the us has enough leverage that they will be worked with i also dont believe trump will start any major wars he is highly successful and even his greatest detractors admit he cares about himself so especially after he has stated he is antiwar i do not see him getting into a situation where he puts himself at risk in terms of his provocative actionsstatements i generally dont have an issue with him i am a quite unpc person and on top of that i have seen many of his actionsstatements twisted brutally out of proportion i think he has a blustery personality and has a habit of talking with his foot in his mouth but i have yet to see something that makes me truly believe he is a cruel or vindictive person   there are any specific questions or if somebody wants me to provide more information on a point i will do so i hope that a civic discussion can be maintained ,1,544,3075,27,0.2222222222222222
cmv all subreddits should specify the exact account age and postcomment karma required to post on them,when i first joined reddit i tried to post in several communities but my posts were either removed immediately since i had a new account or would just disappear from new on the sub while still being visible on my profile this can be very offputting to new users who could be confused as to why their posts are being removed and in addition users could put a lot of effort into creating original content that just gets removed immediately without a chance to be viewed every sub specified the exact account age and karma required to post there then people would be more motivated to post higher quality content elsewhere on subs to gain the karma that they need to post in a sub with stricter rules that they have created original content for  subs that dont currently have a restriction on account agekarma would be unaffected since this requirement would only apply to subs that have a restriction in addition although the upvotes on individual posts tend to fluctuate a lot karma would still be measured in the same way that it is for moderator requirements so this wouldnt be an issue,1,195,1113,105,0.0380952380952381
cmv its not antisemitic to question the uss commitment to israel,"preface im neither jewish nor muslim  this cmv is about policy not religion post is based loosely around the comments made by ilhan omar on foreign government lobbies want to talk about the political influence in this country that says it is ok for people to push for allegiance to a foreign country i want to ask why is it ok for me to talk about the influence of the nra national rifle association of fossil fuel industries or big pharma and not talk about a powerful lobbying group that is influencing policies appears to be voicing her concerns on a powerful lobby no doubt israel but the news articles seems to be pegging her words as tropes  examples including a very politically motivated fox the most basic antisemitic tropes are these jews employ semioccult powers to control world events they manipulate hapless gentiles with their money and jews in the diaspora are disloyal to the countries in which they live omar in the course of making perfectly valid criticisms of israel and its most powerful american lobby has invoked each of these tropes   ny times  
  
but given her previous comments the latest remarks struck many observers as playing into wellworn antisemitic tropes about jewish attachments to israel making them disloyal to the united states  vox  
  
by not forcefully condemning omar’s antisemitism by allowing her to stay on foreign affairs by not condemning the bds movement the democratic party is helping mainstream antisemitism  fox my limited experience there is some weird relationship the us has to israel that i do not fully understand  its absurd for example  that presidential candidates are expected near required to go on national tv to announce their support of israel before caucuses  the amount of aid we send to israel is also disproportionate in comparison to other countries  can you imagine if there was such fanfare over proclaiming support to italy or even russia becomes especially concerning when hearing their prime minister refer to the us as almost a puppet the military presence that israel provides in the region is absolutely invaluable but speaking out against them shouldnt be considered antisemitic  they also appear to be the primary aggressor in building out their settlements i missing something here  why does israel deserve this special treatment for reading if youve come this far",1,405,2601,69,0.10144927536231885

cmv being fat is unhealthy and should be treated the same as smoking,"some facts 
overweight and obesity are the fifth leading risk for global deaths at least 28 million adults die each year as a result of being overweight or obese  why is society saying being fat is ok and that you should be proud of your body if your fat
beauty arguments aside cause my opinion is that fat people are disgusting and that beauty is not a social structure its a biological preference
no being fat is not ok you dont need to be proud of it if you say that people should be proud if they are fat we teach kids its ok to become fat 
being fat is a choice it is not the same as being in a wheelchair
nobody is forcing you to sit on your ass and eat junk food 
some people say i eat healthy and i work out and still i gain weight
that is just impossible if you eat perfectly healthy  and work out  you will burn more calories then you burn  hence you will loose weight 
 to clarify im not talking about shaming them or being rude to them like we dont be rude to smokers but we are allowed to say that smoking is bad its common knowledge we wont ever say that that its ok to be proud that you are smoking 
im not saying that we should shame them or make fun of them we should just not be ok with the fatacceptance movement like we should not be ok with the nicotine acceptance movement
commercials for cigarettes are not allowed anymore  but promoting being obese gets posted on the bbc channel  
 me see why that is correct why should the bbc tell the youth its ok to be fat but are not allowed to air cigarette commercials 

im not advocatin fatshaming  if they dont harm anyone else besides themselves thats their own choise but when they try to convince my kids that being fat is healthy yeah im allowed to shit on them
just like im allowed to shit on people with aids that try to tell my son that unprotected sex is totally ok  
holy shit woke up with 100 replies 
let me clarify a few things
1 a lot of people are arguing against the fact that allegedly defend fat shaming you are creating a strawman argument and then fighting that argument i never said fat shaming is good although i have opinions about that which i noted down below i never mentioned fat shaming in op so that is not what i want my view changed off so  please stay on topic   if you think that saying that being fat is unhealthy and that they should do something about it is fat shaming then yeah you wont change my view
2 what i want to present and try to have changed me view on  is the fact we should treat obesity the same level as we tread smoking the common argument used here is   u dont need to smoke to survive you need to eat to survive my answer eating doesnt make you fat overeating makes you fat eating is needed to survive overeating isnt all the people that saying they do live healthy and exercise but still gain weight well then you either have a misconception of either healthy or exercising its science u cant deny science yes of course some people have a higher metabolism then others so some people have to work harder or eat less then other to stay healthy but thats life still basic science applies all the people saying  smoking harms others obesity doesnt well  thats where you are right and thats where i realized ive chosen a slightly flawed metaphor  of course there are technical differences
but the basic principles of the metaphor still stand we should not allow promotion of obesity just like we dont allow promotion of smoking 
 is that fat acceptance is on the rise i see it more and more each day  on the news  tv  online  the fact is also that the world is getting fatter every statistic confirms that 
cmv just like smoking we should create campaigns to combat obesity and dont be afraid to be called fat shaming if we just state facts that being obese is unhealthy or should we just leave them be and let the fat acceptance grow and let people become fatter because of it

cmv there is nothing morally wrong with paying for sexual activity,today i read an article that called paying for sex evil and exploitative i admit that i took it personally as i pay for sex  context i have very precise sexual needs i am male with a foot fetish for other guys feet i am not interested in conventional sex with either men or women and do not want a relationship instead i am paying guys hundreds to take pictures of rub and suck on their feet they are adults not trafficked and not forced i maintain that there is nothing morally wrong with this  could argue that an unequal capitalist society puts people in a situation where they decide to do something that they would rather not do to gain some benefit they have something that i want and they are willing to trade that for cash how is it any more evil or exploitative than any other capitalist transaction  of the guys use the money to be able to better provide for their kids if it is ok to allow a strong man to use his back to provide for his family then why is it less reasonable to ask him to put his feet up and get paid for something arguably less damaging to his body think the same principle applies regardless of the sexual activity and gender of the individuals involved,1,228,1222,67,0.05970149253731343
cmv successful people from humble backgrounds have had to work harder and so deserve more respect than those with welloff families,in my view people who were born into welloff families and who subsequently become successful for whatever reason dont deserve the same amount of respect as successful people who come from more humble backgrounds its always struck me that most of the time that former type of person has never really known and likely will never know hardship  and even more likely wont have had to work as hard to get where they are as those whose families have less illustrate this idea with the current us president and his small loan of a million dollars from his dad which with inflation would be more like 70 million nowadays he wouldnt have got where he is today without his familys fortune hes had a silver spoon in his mouth all his life  how can he truly understand what americans who are struggling are going through more generally lets compare their childhoods the majority of welloff families are going to want to send their kids to the best schools they can and good for them after all most parents just want the best for their kids said welloff families are also going to be able to pay for extra tuition if their kid is struggling music lessons and so and so forth meanwhile the less welloff families who in many cases will also want the best for their offspring would no doubt want to try and get their kids into good schools  but for various reasons catchment areas financial barriers rigorous entrance tests that just isnt possible same goes for the extracurricular stuff  unless it is subsidised for many workingclass families that sort of thing just isnt feasible the same story at university level aka college if youre american kids with rich parents are able to take full advantage of uni life for example they wont need to take a parttime job to fund studiesliving costs on a side note in the uk our student loan is basically a graduate tax which is written off after 30 years so its not quite as bad as in the states theyll probably be able to pay for textbooksstudy materials foreign trips and all the rest of it conversely the poor kid is going to struggle to pay for a lot of this without a job andor significant financial assistance in the uk at least if youre dirt poor i understand the latter is actually quite decent for students what about those who move to big cities london nyc la etc to try and make it in whatever industry ie the mediashowbiz finance creative industries to name but a few the rich kid is inherently going to be at an advantage because their families can financially support them meanwhile the poor kid is at best going to have to take a job in order to cover if theyre lucky the high living costs in such cities the rich kid can take unpaid internships some of which are necessary for certain industries the media is fairly notorious for them in the uk for the poor kid these are basically offlimits just how is that fair is why i have so much respect for those who have made it from nothing  as trite as this may sound theyve had to go the extra mile in order to get where they are meanwhile someone at a similar level who had many hands up in their life hasnt had to work nearly as hard even if in their minds theyve worked exceptionally hard what have they done theyve had help from mummy and daddy all their lives it seems like nothing theyve done has been entirely off their own backs they were born rich and will probably die rich never truly understanding the struggles of those worse off than them realise much of this post will likely come across as inverse snobbery and to be fair it probably is it is also however a view i have held for some time albeit one which i realise could do with being challenged successful people from more humble backgrounds deserve much more same respect than successful people from welloff background because the former will have worked much much harder to get where they are meanwhile the latter will usually have had a lot of help from their families,1,723,4126,134,0.029850746268656716

cmv documentaries like leaving neverland are setting an extremely dangerous precedent in which we can accuse who we want about what we want and then sit back and watch the subject burn,"recently there has been a massive amount of buzz about leaving neverland a documentary in which two young men reveal they were sexually abused by michael jackson its important to note that these are simply allegations nothing has been proven as fact and nothing has been confirmed in a court of law while there is evidence of some weird behavior faxes photos etc all accusations of sexual assault are literally without any sort of evidence or facts to back them up the days since the documentary aired michael jacksons brand has suffered incredibly damaging consequences including radio stations and music channels worldwide banning his music
 simpsons episode featuring jackson pulled out of rotation
 jackson being publicly shunned and rejected by former friends neither for or against michael jackson but im worried about the the power of onesided allegations as winston churchill once said a lie can get halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on perhaps a poor choice of quote given the context we saying that anyone is able to create a documentary single out insert name here literally accuse them of anything we want and then sit back and watch the subject suffer the consequences seems like a very dangerous precedent that were setting here i certainly do not advocate silencing victims or blocking a platform for people to speak out against mistreatment and victimization i dont think being able to say and do whatever you want on a public forum as huge as hbo usa or channel 4 uk before the subject can respond is fair at all what if you personally were on the receiving end of that anyone who has ever been falsely accused of something and found themselves playing catchup in an attempt to establish their innocence will know that it is a terrible feeling me its akin to punching and kicking a guy taking a nap and calling it a fight these documentaries are extremely harmful dangerous and have the potential to destroy innocent people my view",1,341,2094,188,0.031914893617021274

cmv andrew yangs plan to give all americans 1000 per month would do little more than dramatically increase rent prices and other prices as well,it seems like a universal and equal influx of cash like that without a change in supply will only lead to higher prices especially in areas like housing etc most people it seems who are renters given an extra 1kmo would want to move to a nicer apartment given a much higher demand for nicer apartments landlords will be able to increase prices and maintain full occupancy similarly cheaper housing could see an increase in price because people would have the ability to pay and no other option this extra money flooding the market does not come from an increase in supply or labor so i dont see anything to keep market forces from doing their thing i dont really see the upside understand the arguments for ubi iff automation and ai take away enough jobs to tank the economy but right now unemployment is extremely low and implementing his plan would just effectively lead to inflation can change my view by demonstrating that areas that have seen extensive universal basic income have not seen price increases also i could be convinced by a logical coherent argument showing that theres a flaw in my reasoning,1,195,1145,148,0.04054054054054054
cmv new york city is a terrible place to live,"
to quote my favorite depressed horse new york is a great city to live in for 6 months and not a minute longer and only if youre insanely wealthy just cant hide my disappointment anymore i grew up with movies and books that glamorize the city and people who live there talking on and on about it and showing it as the center of the universe but after having live there for almost a year i just want to say are you kidding me

 sure it is a fine citycentral park is pretty impressive and the city looks wonderful in christmas time fyi so does every other city in the world and the ever famous times square is like the visual equivalent of people shouting at you give me your money buy this and this and that too and you will be happyjust consume so nauseating always have to wait long lines in front of every good club and night life is very restricted to whatever is “popular” at the time and seems like all the clubs are copying each other as a counter example there is a nude night club in amsterdam and don’t let me get started on the nightlife in berlin and charging waaay to much and people are taking more photos than they are dancing

 at the end of the day city is just chaotic and crowded and frustrating and smells weird urine and full of over overpriced cafes and shops that keeps opening and closing and creates unnecessary hype and people wait in looong lines for the weirdest stuff rainbow bagelreally while on the other side of the city people eat whole meals at the price of 1 rainbow bagelthe difference between economic groups is terrifying and tragic 

 public transportation is a lifesaver when the traffic literally stops unless you have a helicopter to fly over and appreciate the skyscrapersyou know like in the movies but you always know your train will be late and subway systems poor infrastructure always makes you feel on edge aand you guessed itit smells funny too and weirdest things happen and people just shrug and smile and say “welcome to new york” like a homeless guy masturbating in the subway is “so nyc” and it is somewhat okay what it is so disturbing and wrong and it was like the least weird thing that happened to me on subway people are everywhere to be clear they are not the problem but victims of a much bigger problem and people walk pass them like its nothing like they are fixed figures on the streets which breaks my heart  on top of that people are mostly stressed and over worked and always running somewhere and yes every business center in every city looks hectic during rush hour but have those people ever been to vienna barcelona amsterdam montreal melbourne are more peaceful in theretake long lunches and they don’t live to work and in general more friendly and happylooking am so tired of hearing people say “new york city is the best in the world” ummm no of those cities i mentioned are much nicer  and healthier to live in than nyc and i never heard them brag about “being the best in the world” or mentioning in every movie they made how nyc is the center of the universe all i see is huuuuge buildings so close to each other and it is suffocating the air and not such a pretty view maybe i’m wrong so please cmv",1,591,3291,47,0.1276595744680851
cmv due to the forprofit nature of healthcare in the us people should be skeptical about the testscare theyre recommended in the hospital,note this isnt an antivax post i fully support vaccines and have vaccinated both of my children of the forprofit nature of healthcare in the us hospitals have a financial incentive to give their patients as many tests as possible and to give patients the most expensive treatment options that they can one of the most common phrases ive heard by doctors when recommending these services is better safe than sorry and while true its important to assess risk relative to benefit which is not something doctors or hospitals are incentivized to do sure better safe than sorry  but does someone really need an xray or mri for an ankle injury when its probably just a sprain the onus to be informed and call bullshit on unnecessary tests falls to the patient the natural consequence of this is that patients need to be skeptical of all tests and treatment options recommended to them this of course puts the patient at greater risk since the typical patient doesnt have a medical degree and cant adequately assess risk on their own but given the known consequence of medical debt vs the unknown consequence of skipping a test the most prudent choice depending on individual circumstance would likely be to skip the test,1,211,1265,143,0.04195804195804196

cmv reddit is the worst site for politics political congregations and political discussion,cgp grey made a hauntingly prophetic video in regard to how emotions particularly anger manifests within large groups of likeminded individuals although it isnt explicitly stated in the video i believe that a way to diffuse much of the problem is by having both sides talk to one another talks story is far too long for me to go through but the essential gist of it is that once someone fills out a survey of their political views they get matched up with those who if they check the box to be able to talk to people that disagree with their views have different political views the project was an unexpectedly wholesome success and there are already expansions towards this concept is the polar opposite of germany talks like many other platforms reddit allows for the specified indulgence in particular communities that interest them while the first thoughts that come to mind would be relatively nontoxic hobbies such as the news gaming jokes and many others the isolation between said communities creates a literal cultural divide between subreddits with the only means of interaction between the two is through crossposting or organized brigades this isnt necessarily a bad thing as rgundam isnt remotely related to raccidentalitalian issues arise when communities that revolve around politics surface if you watch cgp greys video the anger germ doesnt get cultivated between two groups interacting with one another they get cultivated and get increasingly toxic in settings between groups of likeminded individuals sound familiar where they get angrier by stating their detest for the other side it sounds familiar to me these politics also spread and take over other subs with wildly different purposes while runpopularopinions used to be about well unpopular opinions now theyre a circle jerk hub of conservative viewpoints that arent necessarily seen culturally as popular in mainstream media rmurderedbywords is now a dilapidated retardation of rtrumproasts and rconservative and rchapotraphouse are toxic to anyone who doesnt exactly align with their beliefs is the subreddit ontop a shining hill confoundingly by actively encouraging participation on both sides however i believe that since the cgp greyeffect is in full swing people who lean on either extreme are disconcertingly becoming more and more unwilling to talk to each other because obviously the other side is a brainwashed moron who needs fox news or cnn to spoonfeed them fake news since they cant think for themselves i watched mr robot and it really says a lot about our society this leads to the trend of more and more centrist voices only participating in this sub which although i dont discredit centrist opinions is hardly a viable method for us to be able to congregate and discuss matters on political issues that concern us a selfpronounced conservative myself i get offended when someone attacks me of my viewpoint by generalizing me to fit a stereotype when they claim that they want to strip everyone from their stereotypes i get offended when conservatives become disillusioned with society with their few encounters with those with political opinions that are different to them under the guise of we just want to talk i get overjoyed when there are people like boyan slat who at such a young age created such a needed technology for our society and am unapologetically appreciative to people such as flat earth community who dare to challenge against the industryfunded research and are willing to even do their research themselves but if you bring up the good qualities of flat earth or even the antivax community whom id applaud for similar reasons and also abhorrently hate for other reasons in a discussion you immediately get downvoted and essentially for all intents and purposes suppressed because you dared to speak against the hivemind need more systems in place on our website which does have its good qualities to be able to encourage and cultivate programs similar to germany talks i dont have a system in mind posts like this or truth be told i looked around in my own traditionally conservative subreddits for an example to balance things out but its 12 am on a school night so ill let your mind fill in the blanks is not only unhelpful hypocritical but kind of pathetic now this this is good shit i would like to clarify a couple of things after receiving some helpful comments im unsure if my identity would be relevant at all to the discussion i feel best that itd be helpful to point out that i am a 17yearold asianamerican living in asia i lived in america for brief periods of my life and studied abroad in canada for several years i hope this clears up any sort of potential mischaracterization of my identity my title was overtly hyperbolic agario is probably not the best place to go to if you want a nuanced discussion on the politicaleconomic situation in greece i propose the title to mean that reddit is the worst as it presents itself as the communal culture hub of the internet while segregating everyone by their party lines in terms of politics by design of course its not intentional or meant to be malicious the site belongs in rcrappy design,1,872,5808,94,0.0425531914893617
cmv arguing that historically oppressed people such as blacks cannot be racist only fuels further animosity towards the social justice movement regardless of intentions,"hi there ive been a lurker for a bit and this is a my first post here so happy to receive feedback as well on how able i am on expressing my views  many if not most people in the social justice movement have the viewpoint that the historically oppressed such as blacks cannot be racist this stems from their definition of racism where they believe it requires systemic power of others to be racist this in itself is not a problem as they argue that these oppressed people can be prejudiced based on skin color as well they just dont use the word racist  problem however lies in the fact that literally everyone else outside this group has learneddefined racism as something along the lines of prejudice discrimination or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that ones own race is superior google whatever their source is merriam webster and oxford all have similar definitions which dont include the power aspect that these people define as racism  there is a fundamental difference between how a normal person defines racism and how a social justice warrior defines racism even though in most cases they mean and are arguing the same exact point  these people claim in shorthand things like black people cant be racist there is fundamental misunderstanding between what the writer is saying and what the reader is interpreting this misinterpretation is usually only solvable through extended discussion but at that point the damage is already done everyone thinks these people are lunatics who want to permanently play the victim card and absolve themselves from any current or future wrongdoing this viewpoint is exacerbated with the holierthanthou patronizing attitudetone that many of these people take or convey  examples



 took these examples from a similar cmv post that argues that blacks can be racist    type of preaching of blacks cant be racist completely alienates people who may have been on the fence regarding the movement gives further credibilityammunition to the opposition and gives power to people that actually do take advantage of victimizing themselves while the actual victims are discredited all because of some stupid semantic difference on how people define racism  the movement should drop this line of thinking because the consequences far outweigh whatever benefits it brings fact what actual benefit is there to go against the popular definition and defining racism as prejudice  power i genuinely cannot think of one it just seems like an arbitrary change edit i now understand that the use of the definition academically and regarding policies is helpful since they pertain to systems as a whole

cmv high schools or at least the 11th and 12th grade should allow for students to have more choices in the classes that they want to take and have less required classes,"
i’m currently a high school senior well i finished my work a few days ago so technically i’m basically out of school and i found this subreddit and i really wanted to see if people could change my view on this
 since i was in elementary school i’ve never liked school i didn’t want to go to school because honestly i found it quite boring the highlights of my school day were talking to my friends and going to art class because hey that’s what i was interested in i will also just say that i do believe that a big part of me not wanting to go to school was simple kid stuff i’m pretty sure that lots of elementary school aged kids would have rather stayed home and watched tv colored played sports or whatever interested them at that age i’m only mentioning this because it kind of has to do with my argument
 when we physically went to school i remember i was sitting in my calculus class while my teacher was lecturing and i asked myself “why am i learning this” as interesting as finding the slope of a line at a certain point on it and then using that information to find the acceleration of it at that point too i can’t understand how somebody in a non stem field would need to know how to do thisi will admit that this came from a place of laziness and boredom because i will be a computer science major in college and i may or may not be using calculus techniques and ideas but i thought about my friends that were going to major in english art or or even go to college why were they being forced to stay in higher level math classes to get the credits to graduate when they could use that same slot of their time to focus on something they’re actually interested in
 know i’m about to go down the whole middle school meme route with this one like when the class clown asks a teacher when they’re ever going to use a certain concept in their algebra class in real life but i feel like they have a point they just don’t phrase it the right way i ask myself when am i going to use these concepts in real life i had to stop getting math homework help from my parents around my transition from elementary school to middle school because they simply just didn’t remember how to do it it wasn’t applicable to their daily lives it isn’t just adults that forget how to do concepts in school that they were taught it’s teens too i’m a year ahead in math but i can’t count how many times a friend has asked me how to do a concept they were taught in a class that i took last year and i’d respond with “you know i can’t remember” i think that this has to do with either me not being interested enough to know how to solve problems a year after i was taught or i never had to use it again so i cleared my “brain space” for something else
 i went off on a slight tangent there i apologize but i ask again why are high schoolers forced to take these higher level classes that they have no interest in the most common argument i see is that “oh well they’re young and still in high school they don’t know exactly what they want in the future so we shouldn’t have personalized classes” i’d argue against that and say that by the time a student is in the 10th or 11th grade they have a pretty good idea of what they want to do in the future to add onto this many college students do end up changing their major so i don’t see why that argument only applies to high schoolers i feel like if we were not required to take as many “required core” classes we could instead take classes that seem interesting to us and help us explore different activities
 of the classes that i think should be “optional” are super upper level math courses that will only benefit students if they’re going into a stem field and history classes that focus on memorizing little details instead of focusing on the impact on the world for example i believe that history classes that make you memorize when the byzantine empire was founded when it ended and what they did is highly irrelevant information for anybody not going to college for anything historical 

 if anybody could cmv on this it would be greatly appreciated i’m always looking for opportunities to become more educated on certain topics and this is one i’m really interested in
 first i just want to thank everyone who has given up some of their time to write such a detailed and well written response i promise that i’m reading them all even if i don’t respond to you there’s so much to read and i didn’t expect this to get so popular but yeah thank you all again i was thinking of giving out more deltas because some of you guys have such amazing responses but i’m not sure if giving out too many is suspicious it’s my second day on the sub and i haven’t really paid attention to how many deltas are given out per post  thank you to everyone that warned me about the amount of math in cs all i’m going to say is i’m glad that i’m good at math   yes i’ll continue reading all of the responses maybe respond to a few and i might continue tomorrow it’s getting a little late for me thank you all again",1,969,5179,172,0.029069767441860465
cmv daryl morey of the rockets should absolutely not be fired for his tweet supporting hong kong,"daryl morey is the general manager of the rockets on sunday he tweeted a picture with the caption fight for freedom stand with hong kong  
 the following hours the rockets were blacklisted by chinese networks broadcasting partners and even their minor league sister team in china daryl morey deleted his tweet and posted a statement explaining that it was not intended to offend chinese fans this has been called a retraction or apology but a careful reading reveals that it is no such thing  more like an apologeticallyframed press release and the nba posted an english statement explaining that they dont want to offend the chinese and a chinese translation of that statement that was a groveling apology that threw daryl morey under the bus  
 let me argue that daryl morey should absolutely not be fired for this for the following reasons  
  daryl morey is right freedom is good hong kong is fighting for freedom against a chinese government that wants to end the last exceptions it has to the dictatorial constraints the rest of the nation faces were china merely leaving hong kong alone with the levels of freedom it had just a few years ago these protests wouldnt have escalated in the way they have
2 from the purely cynical point of view he did endanger a business hes supposed to work for and profit but only as a mistake and quickly sought to correct it theres no reason to believe that morey intended to cause the furor he did just earnestly express a reasonable opinion as many nba staff members do every day when the consequences became clear he deleted the tweet and wrote his conciliatory statement rather than doubling down likely at the behest of some pr person but anyways minimizing the impact on the business he works for to the best of his ability

cmv banning someone from a subreddit simply because they participate in another subreddit is wrong and not something that should be allowed,so to be clear a person has been banned from a subreddit the moderators of that subreddit should have to have at least 1 post in that subreddit to ban you for i would even go so far as to say there must be atleast 1 post in the subreddit that they can point to as you causing problems or breaking their rules  am mostly thinking of subreddits which seem to have automated banning which targets subs they disagree with either politically or socially hold this view because it excludes people from conversation and does not permit a legitimate member of a community to participate in that community simply based on their membership in another community will now use a scenario not purposefully calling out any particular subreddits as i believe that is against the rules say a sub called whitepeoplearethebest wpb from here out exists and it is dedicated to showing off accomplishments that whites have made throughout history and in modern society say there is a sub called lgbtloveisgreat and it is all focused on supporting lgbt couples and helping people express their love a moderator or perhaps the creator of that sub determines that those who support wpb are all hateful people and they dont want them participating in their sub it is entirely likely that members of wpb want to support the mission of the other sub but because of that one mods decision to employ some automatic ban system or doing so manually they are not able to add to the community be clear i would be most interested in discussion the ideas of directly opposing subreddits such as a progun subreddit against a antigun subreddit or a sub dedicated to benefiting the prochoice movement vs a sub dedicated to a prolife movement i feel like this is the area where i am most unsure on my stance in and i want to know if my view may be wrong in this area specifically though i am open to other discussions the case regarding directly opposed subreddits i can get behind them autobanning based on participating assuming moderators actually take appeals seriously in case of a change of mind in addition a very niche example has been pointed out to me which i can get behind where it involves a directly related subreddit banning you based on certain actions which are against their rules,1,400,2316,142,0.04225352112676056
cmv the average homeowner does not benefit from constantly rising house prices,i often hear that consistently inflation beating rises in house prices are a good thing people who own houses seem very happy that their house has increased in monetary value despite the fact that the utility they get from it has not increased at all given that they are most likely to sell their house in order to buy another often more valuable one they would be better off if house prices went down as this would reduce the difference in price between the two properties an overall economic point of view the total value of housing stock is often quoted showing how the total value has risen this does not describe the actual number of homes which seems far more important it also does not represent an increase in the real size of the economy in the way that increased company valuations do houses are not productive assets am i not taking into consideration thanks all i can appreciate why a current homeowner might be annoyed if property prices were to stop rising i still think society as a whole would benefit but that is the subject of another cmv 2 i am still receiving comments after 20 hours which is great but if you want to change my view at this point you need to say something new i know values rise faster in some locations than others,1,230,1301,79,0.05063291139240506

cmv the paygap in womens national football is fair,"unless specifically noted this post concerns the state of womens football in the us and europe statement of my general views on the broader social issue at play women have historically faced and continue to face unfair labor practices
 there exists a general pay gap for equal work rendered in most industries though it is not nearly as large of a gap nor simple to calculate as the oftenquoted 072 per 100 earned by a man
 i enjoy womens football and believe it has proven value in the mediaentertainmentcultural landscape
 i am not persuaded by the argument men should be paid more for x sport because the worst mens team would still demolish the best womens team i hold this view mens and womens tournaments in the same sport are not equal work the la times compared sports teams to assembly line workers who unarguably deserve the same pay whether they put together a lowselling commuter car or a blockbuster highend luxury sedan but athletes arent skilled workers they are performers and their work is to entertain a specific audience the audience is the work in this equation both beyonce and justin bieber perform live music but they are not doing equal work even though significant portions of their audience may overlap in the sports industry revenue is generated not by the volume of goals scored but by the volume of people willing to pay to watch it happen and buy products branded to their teams and heroes the mens world cup in russia generated over 6 billion in revenue with the participating teams sharing 400 million less than 7 of revenue meanwhile the womens world cup is expected to earn 131 million for the full fouryear cycle 201922 and dole out 30 million to the participating teams just shy of 23 of revenue factoring in the wwcs total team roster at 24 vs the mwcs roster of 32 the perteamperplayer revenue share is substantially higher for the womens teams claims that the womens team in the us brings in more money than the mens team is cherrypicked data  this is true for the past few years but over the long term the more established men’s game brings in consistently higher game revenue year over year revenue sharing does not scale linearly a fixed percent of revenue for both mens and womens tournaments is thus an unfair risk to the governing corporate body it pains me to say this  i hate fifa just as much as everybody in other words committing 10 of 100 million in expected revenue is a much greater financial liability than committing 10 of  1 billion molly levinson the spokesperson for the women’s national team said regarding their lawsuit “these athletes generate more revenue and garner higher tv ratings but get paid less simply because they are women”  the data disagree while the women’s team broke viewing records in the us during the wwc ratings for men’s games have been more than double those for women’s games on average since 2012 according to nielsen calculations  excluding world cup games the men’s team’s ratings are almost four times as high the us soccer federation is genuinely good at rewarding top talent regardless of gender  according to figures provided by us soccer since 2008 it has paid 12 players at least 1 million six of those players were men and six were women  the bestpaid woman made about 12 million from 2008 to 2015 while the top man made 14 million in the same period some women in the top 10 even made more than their male counterparts over those years to qualify for the women’s world cup  the united states women’s team plays five games in a single twoweek tournament the men’s qualifying road is a twoyear 16game slog across north and central america and the caribbean us soccer argues that the roster bonuses for successful qualification — 15000 for the women in 2015 55000 for the men in 2014 — reflect that a wage gap is seen near the bottom of the most paid list when separated by gender  the no 25 highest paid  female player made just under 341000 and the corresponding male player took in 580000 at no 50 the male player made 10 times as much as his female counterpart this is due to the fact that the mens team plays far more many games per year and are paid by appearance as they earn most of their income from their lucrative club deals to account for the lack of a profitable womens professional league in the us all attempts to establish one have failed thus far the ussf struck a deal with the womens players union to pay a fixed base salary to each player regardless of appearances  a comparable pay for play structure that is offered to the mens team would be financially devastating and unfair to the womens team talent roster the mens system results in higher average pay per player but this is a fair concession to the male players who receive nothing if they are not called to camp the lions share of a star athletes revenue comes from endorsement deals with private companies nike will pay an athlete pari paso to what it thinks it can earn from increased sales if the pay given to female athletes in these deals is unfair andor discriminatory based on sex we would need to see the value generated by such deals against what similar male and female athletes were paid afaik this data is not available further endorsement deals are entirely based on negotiation  what is fair or unfair is subjective to each individual deal and the parties involved there is good reason to believe that fifa undermarkets undersupports and underinvests in the womens world cup in their lawsuit the us womens team refers to this as a manufactured revenue depression but fifas failure to fully capitalize on the growing popularity of the womens world cup does not mean players are being paid unfairly it is not unfair to not pay players a share in revenue that doesnt exist because of fifas incompetence fifa has generally been good at increasing compensation to female players as the popularity and revenue of the wwc grows  last year fifa doubled the prize money for this summer’s women’s world cup to 30 million and has now pledged to double it again in time for the next edition in 2023 the uswnts contract with ussf is up for renewal and they will do everything they can to further the rallying cry of equal pay for equal work to achieve its best possible negotiating position i do not think there is anything wrong with this other than they are rallying behind what i view as a false claim that the pay gap is not fair lets discuss i would very much like to change my view on this as i generally dont like to agree with angry voices on the conservative right but my feelings dont matter i want to know if the wage gap in womens football is fair or not my view is that it is fair and is on track to grow be even more favorable to the female players with the increasing popularity of the wwc but my mind is open word choice see strike through 7919  wow this blew up there is a lot of great discussion here so thank you all i fully intend to keep responding thinking and doing additional research today i would like to dig around ussf data and see if i can get a copy of the uswnt lawsuit to see their arguments i will try to keep up as fast as possible so please forgive me if it takes a while to respond to every comment i also wish to work to pinpoint as many specific circumstances as possible that would cmv a big open question i have right now that may lead to some deltas is why arent players male or female commonly paid xx of revenue generated by a team or league 71019  still working to read  reply to every substantive comment  take care of my day job  aslo i got invited to the cmv podcast going to speak with the mods now and accept 71419  folks we have deltas to award changed and unchanged views to declare and a helluva lot more understanding of the issue to share and discuss i’m now ready to make a statement regarding women’s national football in the us i will continue to look into women’s football in europe as i do not yet have enough data nor analysis on this sector would love for anybody who knows anything about this to chime in terminology i use “national football” to refer to the national team that competes against other nations the paygap in women’s national football fair as far as the us is concerned my view currently remains unchanged however i also now believe that the current paygap is fair but unreasonable and it is in the best interest of the uswnt’s employer ussf and fifa to substantially raise wages  “quality of life” terms for female players  fiscal investment in the women’s game i’ve come to this affirmation compensation reflects all real andor potential capital value added to an organization by an employee against the upfront risk the organization must commit  my analysis considers all forms of capital including social marketing brand awareness brand value long and short term returns etc… the current cba between uswnt and ussf went into effective on 112017 well after the usmnt meteoric rise
 the next cba agreement will go into effect in 2021 and it is incumbent on the uswnt to leverage their strongest bargaining chip public adoration changing social attitudes regarding working women public sympathy as much as possible to receive the most favorable terms
 there is little to no risk for the uswnt to stoke public outrage and tie their claim of unfairness to the larger social issue of genderbased wage gaps
 it has not been demonstrated to me that the work of the men’s and women’s teams meet the standards outlined by the equal pay act and equal pay act title vii and thus the heuristic “equal pay for equal work” does not apply
 assuming the uswnt “quality of life” job benefits are unreasonably lower than the men’s eg no chartered plane travel frequency of games not played on natural turf etc… it has not yet been demonstrated to me that the lack of these perks is the product of unfair labor practices nor gender based discrimination
 apples to apples a pure ofrevenue based wage for both men’s and women’s teams would be onthesurface fair but in practice would overwhelmingly favor ussf at the uswnt’s expense to this end the women’s player union has not argued for a pure ofrevenue model nor would their members accept one
 for the past 3 years the us government office of the eeoc investigated the player’s claims of epaepa title vii violations at ussf and did not find sufficient evidence for government intervention note such findings does not mean the ussf is not in violation further the eeoc attempted mediation but these efforts failed
 past discrimination of women in football does not justify greater pay prima facie
 lack of similar negotiating leverage enjoyed by the mens team does not prima facie establish that the deal signed by the uswnt in 2017 is unfair  similarly it does not establish that the deal is fair the increase in wages paid by ussf to the uswnt does however indicate ussf acknowledges that what is fair today is not fair tomorrow especially in the case of elite level performance this is evidence that the current wage gap is generally fair as it rewards the players for exceptional performance deltas to award… going to award deltas to users who changed my thinking andor prompted me to think about this view from new angles even if my overall view didn’t change delta goes to damejudyclench for doing the work providing a thought provoking comparable to consider tennis and pointing me to thought regarding systematic changes that lead to better pay for the womens teams that are not based on emotional appeal back to back world cups is a genuinely good idea worth considering also want to award a delta to a redditor who argued that the uswnt enters into each contract negotiation with hardly any leverage so one must be skeptical that the deal on the other end is fair to this end it caused me to think about what i consider to be fair play and it changed my sideview that outcries of equal pay for equal work from the uswnt were unfair and unreasonable i cannot find this comment because the thread has gotten so big but i mentioned that it was brewing a delta for me awarded to cargdad for showing me evidence and convincing argumentation that ussf unreasonably failed to invest in youth developmental academies for girls so much so that clubs established an unofficial development academy out of frustration if it can be demonstrated that had ussf not failed to established these programs that revenuecapitalvalue generated by nwsl andor the uswnt today would be substantially or substantively higher then i will cmv on my op toplevel claim excellent new sources i pulled including primary source documents norwegien model  an ‘equal pay’ model financials response expert on soccer in america  articles from legal experts at sports illustrated of uswnt lawsuit filings  71719  wow holdontoyerbutts from out of now where with a stunner heshe linked to an informal poll of economists on this issue that just came out today question a in a case like the us women’s national soccer team where the revenues that they generate and their onfield performance both exceed those of the men’s team there is no justification for lower pay only 5 disagreed  going to reach out to a bunch of them to see if i can find out more about what brought them to that conclusion",1,2375,20356,53,0.1320754716981132
cmv protests with weapons should not be considered protected freedom of assembly thats more like threatening terrorism,i want to start this off by saying this is not a gun rights argument im personally not a gun rights advocate but for the sake of this conversation im going to remain neutral on things like what types of firearms should be legal red flag laws etc theres a time and place for that discussion and this isnt it im chiefly concerned about are demonstrations like what happened in the michigan capitol yesterday this could also apply to the previous round of antiquarantine protests the charlottesville marches or any other large protest where participants chose to bring firearms with them my view yesterday in particular was not a protest it was more like an act or maybe more properly a threat of terrorism armed and angry demonstrators stormed the michigan capitol building and brandished their guns to legislators and the governor to convey the message that unless the government does what they want there will be violence is the definition of terrorism  the unlawful use of violence and intimidation especially against civilians in the pursuit of political aims while bringing the guns into the capitol isnt itself an act of terror its pretty clear what they were threatening it checks all the boxes unlawful violence check against civilians check politicians are not military in pursuit of political aims check first amendment states that “congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble part of carrying assault weapons and threatening violence is peaceful i dont care how loud or morally wrong or rowdy a protest is but once weapons are involved the threat of offensive violence against civilians is real weve moved beyond an era when protests were routinely met with police violence and taking into consideration who the police were assaulting in those days black people mostly the current protestors are not justified in their fears of retaliation nowadays its almost always peaceful demonstrators instigating the violence whether it be the extreme right wingers or extreme left adding rifles to that situation just makes everything worse pretty clear that theres a double standard here along racial lines these demonstrators arent flagged as potential terrorists because theyre white i think its time to treat them like what they really are a violent faction of antigovernment radicals who dont think the law applies to them a basic principle that violating the law leads to consequences it has been upheld numerous times in court that a threat can be deemed an assault and there are laws specifically against threatening government officials so whatever you want to call these demonstrators  criminals terrorists disturbances to the peace  they have acted in a way that violates the law and the constitution and they should be held accountable,1,470,2955,122,0.040983606557377046

 discourages the use of false accusations as a form of revenge
 increases the integrity of court hearings as no one in their right mind would lie to court
 saves the government money as they have less court cases over false accusations would change my view

cmv most people tend to conflate criticism of israel and islam as anti semitism and islamophobia respectively,there is a lot of difference between criticism of israel and antisemitism similarly criticism of islam is different from islamophobia think that most people tend to conflate criticism of israel with antisemitism whenever i criticize the human rights violation and military violence perpetrated by israel on palestine citizens i am labelled as an antisemite i think that this is an unhealthy attitude as it shuts down the way for any constructive debates i dont think that there is any antisemitism in the  controversial tweet of ilhan omar on israel lobby but her old tweet on israel hypnotizing the world seems to be antisemitic is not just confined to antisemitism but can also be extended to islamophobia most people tend to conflate the criticism of islam with anti muslim bigotry i believe that questioning the patriarchy or misogyny in islam is not tantamount to hating muslims  no ideology should be immune from any sort of criticism and frivolously invoking labels such as anti semitic or islamophobic to evade from criticisms is an intellectually lazy thing to do am against inciting hatred against any communities and i acknowledge that anitisemitism and islamophobia are indeed a pertinent issue that needs to be addressed and tackled but we should at the same time discern the dichotomy between criticism and bigotry,1,218,1365,111,0.05405405405405406
cmv americans are far too focused on stressful occupations and have a brutal life to work ratio,most people explain the american dream as the opportunity to come from nothing and have the chance to get everything while this might be true people do not realize the rigorous trade offs this entails in america begins with the stressful environment of school most schools weekly schedules are five days a week with days lasting from 8am until 3pm after this 7 hour school day student’s days are consumed with their required homework and various other extracurricular activities they may have this leaves them with minimal free time and maximum anxiety most of this anxiety spawns from the fact that the work students do in their teenagehigh school years can affect their future on a large scale america is structured in a way where if students do not perform well on their tests and get into an elite college they will significantly reduce their chances of success in their adult years this constant stress thrown upon young students is indicative of what they will continue to face in the future pressure put on students is at an all time high and the numbers support this claim depression in american students increased by a staggering 37 percent from 2005 to 2014 source in addition twothirds of college students reported they are experiencing overwhelming anxiety which is up 50 percent from five years ago source does it sound like we are acting upon this issue the increased trend of mental health issues is at the forefront of many institutions discussions yet they fail to change their structure stop the issue at the source after college the life to work ratio is just as overwhelming the average american works about 9 hours a day which means 45 hours of their week is dedicated to their job on top of this the average employee retires when they are 63 years old and the life expectancy of an american is 7874 this means that on average about 80 percent of american’s weekdays are solely dedicated to working in high stress environments although some people may love their jobs time for leisure is imperative to maintain a healthy life obvious counter argument to this is how can a country continue to grow and become more advanced if they do not work tirelessly germany for example has a 35 hour weekly work schedule and enjoys 24 paid vacation days per year despite these short work hours germany is the leader in the industrial industry within europe and is also the leading manufacturer of goods imported by asian nations source furthermore the depression rate in american adults is 17 percent compared to germany’s 9 percent germany works less has great success in many industries and has one of the lowest depression rates in the world source all comes back to the life to work ratio mentioned previously germans have more time to enjoy different hobbies explore the world and meet with family and friends than americans do the american society is obsessed with success and money and people do not leave enough time for the things that they truly love every human is on the pursuit of happiness throughout their life and that pursuit is inhibited by american ideals,1,532,3178,96,0.041666666666666664
cmv vilification of politicians changing positions flipflopping is not a healthy political environment,i can fully understand not wanting your politicians to sway in favour of whichever way the wind blows at any given time most of the reason that this happens is because people want to believe that their choice of politician has and always had held the views that you like because it means theyre unlikely to change but on the other hand if a politician had an outlook on a topic that was ultimately mistaken if they change their mind it shouldnt be a question of their character   example politicians that were for the iraq war have that used against them constantly but theyre unable to flat out say they were wrong because thats seen as being a flipflop when more realistically its just a change in policy in response to new available evidence nobodys denying that the iraq war was bad  but if a politician admits they made a mistake they will instantly be clapped by not just the media but the average joe as well this seems like a pretty toxic environment in which nobody can truly achieve change the purpose of political discourse should be so that everyone can gain a deeper understanding of the topics being discussed   finished responding my view hasnt been fully changed  i still think the accusation of being a flip flopper is flimsy and meaningless but i think i overestimated how much politicians are attacked for percieved flops,1,242,1376,106,0.03773584905660377

cmv martin shkreli the creepy drug price hike guy is a humbling reminder that internet outrage is totally powerless to affect anything that matters,"edit3 i had to delete most of my comments due to an unrelated problem my view has still been changed and all deltas were legitimately awarded and deserved sorry for any inconvenience caused in an ironic turn of fate it appears that shkreli has in fact been arrested as of 20151217 whether he will be convicted is up for debate but its quite possible he may be punished for his actions ive already given out a lot of deltas but this is the final nail on the coffin on my view so to speak seem to think that liking things on facebook or being outraged on reddit has an effect on the real world the only cases where ive found this to be true is when redditors tormented a family who had nothing to do with the boston marathon bombing or other events where someone did something the websites didnt like and got canned for it such as the dongles joke its only the witch hunts on defenseless people that work   practice when it comes to things that actually matter nothing can be done by online petitions martin shkreli is one such example no one on reddit can do anything about him despite their rage the witch hunt fails because he is actually powerful in fact sharing things online and clicking the like button probably makes you less likely to actually do anything in real life because of the feeling that you have already contributed that is why slacktivism is dangerous people have this mindset that one like  one dead terrorist in reality the salient topic is forgotten within days to be replaced by a vine or some other controversy   worrying trend is that online communities are easily manipulated all you have to do is pay a few interns to flood comment sections in fact there is a theory that shkreli himself has played the internet like a fiddle i cant find the post detailing this anymore unfortunately there is a 100 chance that i have been manipulated like this in the past myself without being aware of it usually its by advertising astroturf its hardly an elaborate tinfoil conspiracy simply an online medium that is trivially easy to game it means you have the illusion of being informed when in fact you are ensconcing yourself in an echo chamber look at any political themed subreddit to find evidence of this   you have at least a few examples of online outrage achieving something positive and durable or some other hard evidence please share and ill be willing to change my view there is an onslaught of new comments and i cant keep up will tune in later

cmv oranges are significantly better than apples,lets be honest comparing apples to oranges is actually pretty easy oranges are far superior in many ways oranges have a stronger flavor than most apples its fairly easy to find an orange so sweet yet tart that the flavor is almost overpowering i dont think ive ever had an apple that was as strong as the average orange have a higher liquid content while a large percentage of apples will be too dry are segmented you dont have to slice them up like an apple talk about convenience apple  hassle more like no coreanges with an apple you end up with even more hassle in the form of a core who wants a fruit that leaves you with responsibilities appleeating experience is sub par especially if you dont preslice it unless you cut it up before eating you have to chomp into the whole thing like a stupid dumb horse the skin gets stuck in your teeth and slices up your gums if i wanted slices in my gums i would eat staples apples  staples you eat the whole thing you have to decide when to stop the conclusion of an apple is unsatisfying it just gets weirder and less flavorful and then you eventually have to decide to stop eating you dont finish an apple you give up on it and then you ask yourself should i have eaten more of that apple am i a terrible person for throwing 3 grams of edible fruit away have you ever heard of a color called apple didnt think so another point for oranges and i almost forgot oranges dont turn brown a minute after you open them i probably forgot that part because why the heck is that a thing what kind of crappy fruit would do that apples would do that apples  crapples invented the apple should be fired we need to make room for more orangeventors    apples,1,326,1821,49,0.08163265306122448
cmv sexuality is blown out of proportion,sexuality has become a heated political and social issue and i have no idea why in my opinion it shouldnt matter who or what you fuck your sexuality only defines a fraction of daily life like any other personal trait about you so why is it that so many make their world revolve around their sexuality ive seen children who are new to dating and certainly too young to have sex claiming their sexuality including straight why grow up and mature before making those kinds of decisions  now have flags marches anthems symbols protests bathrooms etc all because people decided that who they fuck defines their entire character and they need to share it with the world for whatever reason i respect your decision to be attracted to whoever or whatever you want to an extent of course i see now that sexuality being blown out of proportion is for people to feel loved and accepted within their own community ive changed my view,1,165,977,42,0.09523809523809523
cmv jump scares are a cheap party trick and movies that are full of them shouldnt be considered horror," ive noticed that most horror movies rely on jump scares something will unexpectedly pop out at the audience a loud noise will startle everyone you know the works sometimes the movie tries to trick people into believing that a certain scene will have a jump scare to make the viewer feel safe and then do a jump scare in the next scene think that movies like paranormal activity the conjuring and the darkness do not do their best to scare the audience in a creative way scares do something physical to your body sometimes my mom jumps out at the me when i walk through the door to elicit a scream or a fear reaction from me however a second later im just laughing because its silly and not at all scary i go see a movie at the theater that has a lot of jump scares most of the audience members just seem to be laughing you may hear a collective gasp or a scream but thats just a reflex  movies riddled with jump scares do not leave an impression on me i find them annoying scares do not tell a story that sends shivers down your spine and causes you to lay awake at night jump scares do not show you a gruesome scene that will be burned into your mind for the weeks to come scares are cheap party tricks they are annoying and do not elicit any feelings of terror  my view

cmv social media is the worst thing to happen to the developed world in this century and there is nothing we can do about it,"before i even get into the recent scandals here is why i think its bad for us it is addictive positive feedback loops are created with likes karma retweets notes whatever you want this makes people want to stay on the website the infinite scrolling makes us lose the track of time and stay longer on the website the constant flow of notifications makes us come back on an app as often as possible all of this exploits human weaknesses to make us more addicted to whatever platform were on
2 that in itself wouldnt be a bad thing if it was good for us or at least harmless but its not a study from researchers of the university of pittsburg show that social media makes us sadder angrier and more vulnerable to depression or anxiety
3 there is no escaping them facebook especially it has become so omnipresent and does so many things that it has become an inconvenience for other people if someone isnt on facebook parties are organised there money is exchanged messenger is by far the most popular messaging app in the world everyone is on there so why wouldnt you  this is called the network effect and it is why there is no escaping facebook ive been  thinking about leaving facebook for a year now and i pretty much dont use it but i never have because of peer pressure that is my responsibility but im sure im not alone here
4 it has turned everything we read and watched into quick bites that are only made to make you feel some way because of that positive feedback loop i mentioned in point 1 we expect that kind of dopamine rush from everything most people only read the title of articles no matter how clickbaity they can be the news have been condensed into videos only a couple of minutes long that usually arent made to inform but that are made to give some feeling to the viewer so that they keep watching more stuff this imo the main reason why people are angry when they use social media  anger sells this problem arguably doesnt just come from social media but this is definitely a big part of it
5 and finally i get to the streak of scandals weve seen about twitter facebook or reddit in the past two years about the russian bots about cambridge analytica that last one has made me absolutely terrified about how well social media can be used to brainwash people this is what makes ai dangerous the fact that we can now change peoples opinions by using human weaknesses im not developping this post too much because there is still a lot that i need to understand but the more i read about this and the more terrified i am of social media i might sound like my parents ten years ago telling me that the internet is bad but most of what i said above is empirically backed research here is the opinion bit and what id like to debate  we cant fight this no matter how much we keep warning people about how facebook brainwashes their users only a fraction of people are actually gonna pay attention because we all like to believe that were smarter than that  always been very optimistic when it comes to technology id like to stay that way but im having trouble are two debatable things here the fact that social media is bad and the fact we cant do anything about it feel free to challenge me on both points i want to be more optimistic about this  bit of an update because im having trouble keeping up with the flow of comments i have changed my view significantly so thanks everyone for the comments ill give deltas when i have a bit more time on my hands but be sure that i will heres where i stand now  media is still terrible the way they are now and the harm that they currently do dont make up for the benefits but because we are aware of the problems they have things might change i also overestimated the inescapability of facebook because im french and here it is almost inescapable but you guys are giving me hope also my title is absolutely terrible sorry i think i havent made clear that i dont hate technology i love it self driving cars are my dream and the internet has given us some great things patreon helps artists spotify ended music piracy etc my animosity was only directed at social media mostly facebook twitter instagram and the likes everyone for taking the time this is a conversation we need to have",1,792,4672,126,0.03968253968253968
cmv the glorification of victimhood andor marginalization status by some is a bad precedent for society moving forward,over the course of the last few years ive seen an everincreasing push for the idea that those who have been victimized in some way shape or form should be propped up and promoted by society  while i understand the fact that this is all rooted in sympathy and in many instances has done great good for society the ideology behind it as ive noticed has grown increasingly rigid  its hard for me to put into words but basically the idea is that people blindly rally behind the less fortunate and proceed to push a narrative that because they are less fortunate society should do all that it can to rectify the situation idea is not inherently bad i dont believe but in many cases ive noticed that society sometimes writes metaphorical blank checks to those who have been victimized where if they have an opinion you are not allowed to challenge that opinion unless you yourself are a victim lest you hurt somebodys feelings  for example if two people are having an argument about say domestic abuse and one of the person has personally been a victim of domestic abuse then the common thread i see far too often is that even if the victim has incorrect or dubious claims as to the facts involving domestic abuse that social pressure dictates that you dont contradict them or youre an insensitive asshole also seen it arise in situations such that rather than helping victims it becomes easier or more convenient to shame or silence those who arent victims which is especially egregious when combined with intersectionality to assume who is and is not a victim based off of certain aspects  for example ive often been in groups of people friends coworkers fellow students what have you where when people bring up harassment or discrimination that theyve faced that when i bring up instances in which its happened to me im shut down with youre a man get over it or well youre white so it probably wasnt that bad and things along those lines as if because my group is not traditionally marginalized then im not allowed sympathy gotten to a point that sometimes people consciously play up bad things that have happened to them in order to extract as much pity as possible from a society in which pity ironically becomes power  rant aside the reason i think it sets a bad precedent is 1 the constant vying to be the most oppressed person in the room creates a culture where we constantly dwell on the problems in our lives because if you work past a problem and put it behind you then youve voluntarily discarded a social asset  this can create negative outlooks at best and cause situations in which individuals actively look for ways in which they can become victims at worst  2  it is a bad idea to run a society based off the views of the most marginalized to the exclusion of those who are not  should the marginalized have a say  absolutely  but everybody should have a say on things and if not everybody then the experts should  the thing is that being a victim of something doesnt inherently make you an expert on how to fix something anymore than being a perpetrator would  we shouldnt form our opinions on whether vaccines are good or not entirely based off the personal experience of that one mother whose child died because of a rare side effect of vaccination  3 and this is my weakest held argument just something that slightly concerns me for all of human history society favored strength and weakness was something to be hidden  it was unwise to bare your vulnerabilities lest they be used against you  a society which favors showing the world your every scar in order to gain social acceptance stands juxtaposed to the human condition and it worries me that at some point society could revert to the historical norm and all these vulnerabilities that people posted on the internet years ago be dug up and used against them this being said i am not against showing sympathy andor empathy to those who have suffered  i only take issue with taking things further and giving victims special social privileges,1,728,4162,121,0.03305785123966942

cmv solving a rubiks cube in the fewest moves is far a more impressive intellectual feat than solving it quickly,i will preface this by saying that i have nothing against speedcubing and speedcubers it is highly impressive that people can solve scrambled cubes in a matter of seconds and i respect all those who dedicate their lives to mastering the art of solving them quickly there is no denying that it takes a huge amount of training skill and manual dexterity to become a competitive speedcuber being said i believe that being able to solve any given permutation of the cube in the fewest moves is a far more impressive intellectual feat and one that should be valued more in competitions speedcubers are fast because they can recognise patterns quickly and are able to apply memorised algorithms this takes a lot of practice but is ultimately a question of experience as you become more familiar with different permutations of the cube you develop a feel for which algorithms to apply and can rapidly execute them as a result  the other hand i am under the impression that fewestmove solves are much more difficult to master since there are no fixed solving methods for any given arrangement of the cube it becomes an exercise in trying to develop your own algorithms on the fly so as to minimise the number of moves you will need as opposed to an exercise in quickly applying algorithms that you have already memorised in a sense this makes it more like solving a rubiks cube au naturel  without having read up on algorithms at all  a task that very few would be able to accomplish in my view this makes it much more intellectually stimulating and challenging than speedsolving and is why i believe that fewestmove solves should be the centrepiece of rubiks cube competitions cmv ive just woken up and have received a tremendous number of replies from cubers and noncubers alike thank you all for your input ive really enjoyed reading your replies even though i havent had the chance to respond to all of them the replies i have received from those experienced in both events have been the most enlightening i gather it looks like im underestimating the amount of algorithmic thought required for fewest move count solves and oversimplifying the process of speedsolving im not sure ive reversed my opinion just yet but it does give me something to think about i also no longer think there is a valid basis for valuing what is perceived to be the more intellectual event in cubing competitions,1,419,2456,114,0.043859649122807015
cmv the xboxstyle controller layout is ergonomically superior to that of the playstation,specifically i am talking about the xboxs offset thumbsticks compared to the playstations symmetrical design with both sticks in the lower area upper left positionwhere the xbox has the left thumbstick and the ps has the dpadis the most easily accessible area for the left thumb when gripping a controller as intended it is where the thumb naturally rests it requires less of a stretch of a thumb which allows for greater comfort less fatigue and possibly even more precision ps1 controller may have had good reason to keep the dpad in the upper left at the time we were still making the transition to games that were reliant on thumbsticks however now the left thumbstick tends to be the primary directional control can assume that the big 3 console makers have expert ergonomics consultants indeed i know that microsoft does with respect to xbox because i worked for an engineeringergonomics firm that was consulted on this matter i did not personally work on the project both microsoft and nintendo in the switch itself and the switch pro controller have opted for the offset design for sony i recall reading that they considered going to the offset design for the ps4 but decided that the current design is too iconic and central to their image in other words as a business decision they prioritized aesthetics i remember reading this story during the early ps4 days but now i cant find it believe that most unbiased people will prefer the xbox design indeed there are several kinds of thirdparty ps4 controllers with offset thumbsticks while xbox users who want to use a parallel stick design dont have many options naturally many say they prefer the sony design because it is what they are accustomed to and there are always exceptions especially due to how people grip the controller but for most the ps4 controller is ergonomically inferior there were some great responses i couldnt quite give out a delta because nobody changed my view but theres still time also pm me if you play apex legends on psn its my only console and yes i play with a dual shock i suck but id rather not play with randoms pathfinder is my main 2 the error many people are making here is comparing the actual xbox controller to the dual shock 4 please do not do that in fact forget xbox and sony think of a nintendo switch pro controller my contention here is that the left stick above the dpad where it currently is is superior to a hypothetical switch pro controller where the left stick is below the dpad,1,440,2615,90,0.06666666666666667

cmv harry potter and the cursed child fans  general public are right to question the casting of a black actress for the role of hermione because she is the only raceshifted character in the play,"when the original harry potter and the cursed child cast was first announced there was some uproar confusion and defense over the choice of casting a black woman to portray hermione granger there was even a change my view post related to it was totally on the this is not a problem side of this for a long time because i hadnt seen the play it finally came to san francisco so i saw it this weekend now that ive seen it i have changed my mind this isnt dont have a problem with raceshifted characters in general the best musical of the decade hamilton prides itself on casting raciallydivervice characters when i saw hamilton george washington and alexander hamilton were black the schulyer sisters were hispanic  asian  white philip hamilton was central americanpuerto rican hard to tell at a distance but certainly hispanic i loved all of it i think this is excellent show the world that it doesnt matter who plays the characters its about the story and the music not what color of hair general lafayette has is the same for other productions like les mis or phantom or rent ive seen asian women play eponine black men play macbeth and more i love it and i encourage it i care this time  reason i care is because hermione was the only raceshifted character from her portrayal in the movies by emma watson the appearance to the movie characters actually seems to be striking in every other case except hermione they deliberately made the other cast members appear as similar as possible to their inmovie portrayals of this choice hermiones actress stands out as strikingly different and its jarring it made me wonder why the choice was made and almost made her feel a little bit more tokenlike than i would have liked would have preferred they go against the grain and castan asian harry potter actor or a hispanic dumbledore maybe a black mcgonagall make it clear that race isnt important to the story or stay true to what youre obviously mimicking casting director for harry potter  the cursed child should have either committed to being raceagnostic and changed the racesgenders of more characters
2 or stayed true to the movieportrayals of all characters they did both stayed as true as possible to the movie portrayals for every character except hermione it becomes too jarring and the actress stands out more than is fair to her",1,413,2676,200,0.075
cmv if america really wants illegal immigrants out in order to preserve american jobs and save american tax dollars america should take measures to reduce demand for illegal workers rather than fight against the incentives by trying to keep them out,"here is an exchange between a friend of mine and myself which he abandoned  in which i outline what i think would be a reasonable alternative strategy to wallbuilding and fix for some of the employmenteconomic problems of us immigration enforcement i would like to continue the conversation with you all and invite commentary about the potential pitfalls of my design as i do not believe it is at all the overall best solution to the immigrationemployment problem merely a system that could potentially work given the aims outlined in my title in a vacuum as well as direct opposition on the basis of a wall or different priorities being somehow better than this approach  my assumption is that a physical barrier isnt effective at keeping people out if there is sufficient incentive for them to get in i realize my friends argument isnt the most cohesive so i am really only including it for context on the premise thanks for reading    
 you ever worked with anyone that shouldn’t be in america i’ll tell you a story about a guy named luis he can claim tax exempt has free healthcare gets ebt i know because this is how he bought lunch one day illegitimately taking a job of an unemployed legal american working in the construction field for over 10 years has opened my eyes to the fact that no ones cares they are here they just want everything to be fair same healthcare opportunities same taxes same pay but what i have seen is that contractors get what they pay for sloppy work and constant call backs but in reference to the wall why does one build a fence is it to keep the nonsense out or keep the dog in i say get rid of the what if’s about the wall build it first to keep the presidents promise i believe he was asking for a little more than 2 billion for it out of a budget in the trillions best case scenario is we just put people to work essentially giving the money back to the people build it kill the argument response    
 counterproposal to your antiimmigrant sentiment is to hold the unpatriotic employers of illegal workers accountable for their illegal employment practices if there is genuinely an american ready and willing to take a job currently being held by someone without documents the employer of that illegal worker is culpable for cutting his fellow american out of the workforce the employer should pay the taxes and the benefits and the healthcare for every illegal employee that can be proven on their payroll as they would typically with any other employee and pay the equivalent of a median unemployment salary for the american he has disenfranchised and pay fines on top of it to fund enforcement of the law that would fix every complaint  you have about luis except his shoddy workmanship  it would remove the incentive for employers to utilize illegal labor through strict penalties it would shift the tax burden from everyone to just the law breakers if employers stopped employing illegal labor it would reduce demand and not as many people would come here once all that deterrent is in place we just need to enforce everything better perhaps you are asking why i would prefer to punish the american businesses and not punish the immigrants the answer to that is that the immigrants mostly have no power and nothing to take away if an immigrant comes here and works illegally they only have their wages if we take the job away from them they cant pay fines or taxes jailing and deporting them costs us money not them its better to remove the incentive for them to be here and have them go away on their own or follow the proper channels revise the visa program but maintain the onus of tracking on employers and get in legally if you really want to solve this problem thats the way you do it as long as there is demand and incentive for people to come here illegally and for employers to employ them illegally without sufficient deterrent people are going to find a way",1,712,4031,253,0.03162055335968379
cmv telling other people to smile is annoying if not rude,while i agree that smiling is beautiful and inviting the act of telling someone to modify their facial expressions is rude  i am a man and get told to smile often by women  i eventually told a coworker that i didnt have a problem with smiling but i advised her that it should be my choice  was this response appropriate i am told this by someone i already dislike i respond by saying i only smile at people i like  if it’s a stranger i might say “no thank you”  i have every right to have a resting bitch face or a fart mouth if i want  maybe complimenting someone or otherwise making them feel better is more appropriate funny thing is i actually smile more frequently now than i used to  i suffered from severe depression anxiety mood swings and alcohol abuse for many years before seeking help  i smile much more often now because i feel better  but i can guarantee that when i had those issues being commanded to smile never made me feel any better i dont know if i came off like a dick in the above post so id like advice on how to respond to this type of interaction  i agree with one commenter that my interpretation as to the motive behind the request eg is it for my wellbeing or their comfort plays a factor however i stand by my argument that its annoying to demand someone change how they look  even if faking a smile is scientifically proven to make someone happy a facial expression is a choice ive only told people to smile while taking their picture  i would never have the temerity to demand it in any other context,1,302,1615,58,0.06896551724137931
cmv all citizens regardless of socioeconomic status should have the same quality of legal representation in civil and criminal litigation,it goes without saying that at least in the united states having more money means having access to better legal representation in criminal and civil court although i do not know of any systematic studies that establish a correlation between the amount spent on legal services with the probability of a favorable outcome it seems commonsensical and undeniable that there is some discrepancy between the quality of legal representation the wealthiest american receive and that of the poorest americans some this state of affairs might seem fine so long as the poorest americans have access to  legal representation of some minimal level of quality in the same way you might think it is okay for the wealthiest americans to purchase healthcare that his superior to some baseline level of care available to all americans there is a crucial distinction between healthcare and legal representation  to see this consider the right to vote for the healthcare model of fairness seems totally inappropraite its not that everyone should get some minimum amount of influence one vote but that wealthier americans should be allowed access to more many votes rather we expect everyones level of influence on elections to be the same seems to me that the same should hold of legal representation just as everyone should have the same level of influence in a democratic election everyone should have the same level of influence in a legal proceeding to which they are a party the probability that someone say is convicted for a crime given a body of evidence should be the same regardless of who is charged with the crime largest obstacle to realizing this state of affairs is of course implementing a fair and effective policy that doesnt end up becoming a bureaucratic nightmare to ensure that the rich do not have superior legal representation the government would have to enforce spending caps on legal services proportional to the nature of the tort or crime in the same way some states set prices on drugs in addition to providing subsidies to anyone who cannot afford those services but this question of implementation is independent of the question of justice it seems obvious to me that the rich should not have access to better legal representation simply because they are rich even if it is difficult to imagine a workable system in which they do not in fact have it common implementation objection to socialized law is that it would greatly incentivize frivolous litigation by the poor by removing its cost and it is probably true that if the poor could effectively sue anybody for free we would see a major spike in the overall amount of litigation but a world in which both the poor and wealthy alike are overly litigious strikes me as far more preferable and just than a world in which only the rich are  ie the current state of affairs another way of putting this is that whatever obstacles a society puts in place to reduce litigation should apply to the rich and poor alike a common response has been to point out that if quality of legal representation isnt determined by wealth there will still be inequalities between peoples legal representation due to the unavoidable differences in lawyer quality i dont see this as inconsistent with my point  in an ideal world all lawyers would have the same skill level  but in the absence of ideal conditions the fairest distribution of good and bad lawyers would be random or in proportion to the nature of the case rather than by income 2 thanks for the replies everyone i didnt expect to receive so many thoughtful and informed responses and i really enjoyed the discussion my first post here couldnt have enjoyed it more my view about the fairness question remains unchanged but i have been given more reasons to be skeptical about the possibility of a workable implementation the most persuasive consideration was probably that the wealthy under the proposed system would inevitably advert to outside legal council  effectively reintroducing the inequality at a different level of legal representation,1,690,4216,141,0.02127659574468085
cmv in the next couple of years amazon will buy valve buy steam from valve or make their own software to become the primary pc game distributor,amazon is rich as fuck and it wont be long until theyre the largest retailer in the world theyre currently 3rd behind walmart and cvs their purchase of whole foods shows theyre interested in expanding into new markets also not ignorant to the world of gaming having purchased twitch in 2014 you can find lots of complaints online about operationsadministration at twitch but they have undoubtedly expanded its audience in the last 4 years and i think the amazon higher ups view it as a financial success think they see that theres more money to be made in the industry and being a game distributor fits right in with their existing business model i think the game distributor business matches their style more than trying to make their own games it certainly seems like a morereliable way to make money making games is financially risky but it could also be super rewarding see pubg and fortnite really knows but googling shows that valve is maybe worth about 5bil thats not an unreasonable purchase price for amazon having previously spent 1bil for twitch and 14bil for whole foods they wanted to make their own software they could easily sell every game at 50 discount for a year just eating the cost while they corner the market but at that point why not just buy steam can also find a few reports online from various exemployees that describe valve as kind ofstagnant they say its lost the innovation and motivation it used to have some even point to gabe newell specifically and say hes no longer motivated and spends most of his days just playing dota this implies that he could be receptive to buyout offers,1,284,1697,147,0.06802721088435375
cmv all free to play games with microtransactions should have the esrb m rating,to condense my argument for this position here are some highlights of what supports such an argument children this decade have the most access to technologies that were completely inaccessible to similarly aged children last decade free to play games use skinnerbox psychological exploits to garner money from people who have an addictive personality eg whales and children via the means of pester power which is outlawed in countries under the eu a lot of mobile free to play games use cartoon series to appeal to children which fall in line with the previous reason and exploiting pester power to gain money from parents most youtubers with younger audiences are beginning to be sponsored by mobile free to play companies the m rating would deter parents from allowing their child to even play the game thus giving the strategy of using microtransactions a very negative stigma in regards to making a profit summing everything up above the m rating would be due to the risk of having children develop an addicting personality eg the reason why casinos only allow people 21 years and older to gamble and would benefit both them and even many others so that these companies would have a reason not to use such a strategy any of you are welcome to try and change my perspective on this issue and i certainly hope we can have a conversation about this issue bear in mind this isnt an argument to ban free to play games as a whole but more having the esrb crack down and rate these games properly,1,263,1610,82,0.14634146341463414

cmv convincing ugly people to think they are not ugly is more harmful than accepting their ugliness,ugly people should be taught to love themselves because being ugly is ok not because everyone is beautiful convincing unattractive below average people that they are pretty is doing more harm to them it empowers the idea that beautiful is good ugly is bad and you have to be beautiful to be loved it makes ugly people to have unrealistic hopes which can make them delusional or depressed  are lots of downsides to this they might want attractive partners and keep getting rejected and get frustrated they will get crushed when they find out other people actually thought they are unattractive they can no longer trust other people and it will be a lot harder for them to get over it as they arent prepared how to love themselves being ugly they might get obsessed with their looks and care too much about how other people perceive them because some people will tell them they are unattractive and some people will be nice and tell them they are beautiful this kind of different opinions make them overthink and do mental gymnastics and have unrealistic hopes the very harmful and toxic maybe  like telling short people they are tall no they are not thats just a lie that will make short peoples lives so much harder it makes people keep thinking how tall is tall am i tall enough am i tall enough to this person am i short in this country but tall in that country  we should tell them they are short and its just fine just like how we should tell the average people they are average and ugly people they are ugly thats not being an asshole you can say it in the nicest way ugly person should be able to stop caring about their appearance my appearance isnt my strength so i should work on something else is a very healthy mindset if they want to work on their appearance thats very healthy too to think that they are average when they are indeed below average and they can be above average by doing this and that is not course beautify is subjective its fine to say they are attractive if you think so even though they arent conventionally attractive i believe beauty comes in all shapes and sizes but so is ugly a skinny person can be ugly a blonde can be ugly a 22 year old can be ugly there are a lot of people that sugarcoat too much and simply lie this is extremely harmful to all of the less than drop dead gorgeous people,1,435,2413,103,0.038834951456310676
cmv pride parades should have less nsfw content,to preface im bisexual and i love pride month and pride parades however i think that the amount of inappropriate content impedes some of the intent behind pride  me pride is about celebrating the lgbt community and promoting acceptance and understanding its about not being ashamed of who we love and what we identify as and being able to share that with the world  think the parade would ideally be a great place to bring our families to show parents and children how incredible and talented the community is im not out to my family but bringing them to pride would be a great start towards warming them up to accept me but generally given the amount of public nudity and sexual inappropriateness at pride this is pretty much out of the question  order to be more inclusive and celebrate love with as many people as possible i think pride parades should tone down the sexual undertones and focus more on the concepts of love pride celebration and acceptance ,1,173,993,48,0.16666666666666666
cmv a unified earth flag instead of a countrys flag must be used when humans first land on mars and thereafter,"now i dont have a problem with the americans planting their flags when they landed on the moon it was during the peak of the space race and it was essentially usa vs russia so i get that i also do not mind what flag would be used in this scenario i personally do quite like the most well known earth flag shown here however there are some other good designs such as this and this to me its not the flag design that i was debated its the concept of using a flag to represent earth going forward are the reasons i believe we should use a united earth flag going forward in a time where wars and conflict are decreasing and the world is coming together in many ways having a flag to represent the planet would be a fantastic idea what better way to push this idea than to have the entire planet broadcast itself to the universe under one flag
2 instead of people believing that for example only the usa made it to mars we would show how the human race made it to mars everyone in the world would be linked to moments such as these not just countries as a brit i dont feel connected to the apollo moon landing like americans would if the flag was that of earth my feelings would be much different
3 it would cost virtually nothing for space companies to change from using a countrys flag to the unified flag 
4 it symbolises a united earth not just a specific country people from the future would look back at these great moments of space triumph and see how the earth is completely capable of coming together i understand that after time any flag that is planted on mars would fade into a plain white however that is not the main reason i think we should advertise as earth and not as individual countries to me its not just about planting the flag representing earth while that would be an amazing symbolic moment when it happens its about the earthhuman race venturing out into space as one  struggled to find counterarguments for this idea so id like to hear if anyone has any im gonna do my very best to reply to everyone  however if you comment with points ive already replied to im not gonna reply to them individually 1 links to the flags above werent attached 2 woah this blew up thanks to everyone who has commented i’m still gonna try and reply to everyone i can but it might take a while",1,437,2619,116,0.05172413793103448
cmv win or lose donald trump has drastically altered american political culture for the worse and opened the door to all kinds of batshit insanity in the future,let me just say now that this is not a thread to discuss whether or donald trump ought to be president my view is that hes a national embarrassment the worst mainstream presidential candidate in us history and utterly unqualified to hold any public office and im not likely to change that view any time soon what i want to discuss is the extremely unusual and alarming nature of this election cycle and what it means for the future of america and the world tldr is this donald trump has essentially changed the rules of american political culture in such a way that hes completely erased any standards of decency honesty or credibility from the electoral process things that would have ended political careers before this election cycle have now become so normal with trump that no one even cares and that bodes very very poorly for the future this source is obviously biased it aggregates using external sources the evidence for the point im making and which we all understand already donald trump has said and done a lot of insane deplorable shit and somehow still has a very real shot at becoming president what the hell is going on here remember just four years ago when mitt romneys takers blunder nearly sank his campaign and almost certainly contributed to his defeat at the polls remember when a single gaffe like that was nearly fatal to a presidential candidate what the fuck has happened over the past four years and whats going to happen in the future as we near the debates which are all but guaranteed to be a shitshow unlike anything weve seen before i cant help but wonder if trump loses i worry about the next lunatic and the next one trump has paved the way for more candidates as bad or worse than him and if he can come this close to winning now it seems to me like its only a matter of time before someone of his ilk gets elected thanks to trump and his supporters weve entered a bizarre alternate dimension where candidates can lie about basically anything and no matter how fucking crazy or bigoted they get it means nothing at all to their supporters feelings have completely trumped facts and logic for a huge portion of the voting demographic this antiintellectual undercurrent has been strong in american politics since forever but i never thought it could get this bad nor did many others we were wrong and now im legitimately worried about the future this is not a thread about hillary clinton either she is dishonest but in no way remarkable in that regard shes far more qualified and certainly doesnt lie as shamelessly as trump or pander to xenophobia nearly as much this is part of my view that youre not going to change so if youre going to try to derail the thread kindly move along edit for those disappointed that i awarded a delta the rules say to award one if someone changes your view in some way the poster in question did convince me that i may be overstating the problem and that the future may not be as dim as i made it out to be but i nevertheless still hold the concerns outlined in the op,1,552,3294,163,0.04294478527607362

 i have often seen people who post comments on social media praising women empowerment but then they start calling men pigs and other names which sparks negative responses from some people and praise from others i think there should be a way to convey the message of feminism without causing men as a whole to be completely the bad guy i know there are some men who can be really sexist but i also know lots of men who arent like that  my experiences its hard to have a respectful and honest conversation with someone if they were to insult your gender or ethnicity or any part of your identity its also hard to make someone listen if you start off in that same way  do acknowledge sexism has come from a dark history of abuses on women which yes they do come from men but i just want to say that not all men are like that and saying all men are scum or something close is a hasty generalization and wont completely help in the goal of gender equality any gender male or female is never good it belittles the other side and downplays any struggles they face women should be able to do things men can do and men should not be looked down on due to weaknesses such as their mental health shouldnt aim to empower a single gender to the point where they can belittle the other side and still be in the right that was what led to sexism in the past that were facing now we should aim for equality no gender should be looked down upon in any situation sorry if my english was bad im new to this subreddit and its not my native language you have a good day fixed some terms used here",1,370,1996,67,0.05970149253731343
cmv having sex with someone while knowingly having a transmissible sti and not telling your partner should be rape,today on the front page there was a post about florida man getting 10 years for transmitting an sti knowingly in the discussion for this there was a comment that mentioned a californian bill by the name of sb 239 which lowered the sentence for knowingly transmitting hiv i dont understand why this is okay  if youre positive why not have a conversation it is your responsibility throughout sex to make sure that there is informed consent and by not letting them know that they are hiv i cant understand how there is any obviously theres measures that can be taken such as always wearing condoms andor engaging in pre or post exposure prophylaxis to minimise the risks of spreading the disease and consent can then be taken  but yet theres multiple groups i support who championed the bill  eg the aclu lgbtq support groups etc so what am i missing i seem to have just gotten into a debate about the terminology rape vs sexual assault vs whatever this isnt what i care about im more concerned as to why reducing the sentence for this is seen as a positive thing and why it oppresses minorities to force stis to be revealed before sexual contact,1,209,1417,116,0.0603448275862069
cmv i think it is shameful that every modern nation has national vacation polices except for america,"i think that it is shameful that americans don’t get more time off from work it seems that most of our lives revolve meaningless work at times just for the sake of work i think it would be more appropriate to value your workers more and emulate countries like italy france and new zealand whom provide mandatory time of for its citizens 
i have a coworker who just had a kid and can’t afford to be home with her my company’s pto policy is 2 weeks per fiscal year and she has met this from being sick this has caused a lot of people around the office to fall ill and use their pto time for sickness i know this isn’t very relevant to vacation but still it is like we are work martyrs  personally i feel that free time leads to reflection and growth this contributes to an overall better sense of wellbeing and happiness and i don’t think we are doing much to encourage that in our society 40 hours a week 50 weeks a year for 40 years just doesn’t seem fair 
i think we should provide our citizens with a baseline of minimum time off from work i think that this will be great for several aliments of our society think about it how many of us truly like work it is an necessary evil roughly 70 of americans are unsatisfied with their work and we spend most of our time goes there i am open to fair debate and education on this topic thanks reddit

cmv it should be illegal for bankscards to charge a surcharge for checking your balance at an atm,i work with the homeless in my spare time and most of them are obviously in dire financial situations many of them cant normal bank accounts because of this so theyre often forced to use prepaid reloadable debit cards for what limited funds they might acquire often these are predatory business models that are designed to take as much money from the poor as possible one of the most grievous examples is charging a surcharge to check a balance at an atm these people often dont have access to cell phones or computers to do an online inquiry of their balance so theyre forced to check it periodically at an atm which incurs a charge im not talking about a charge implemented by whomever owns the atm i rarely see that anymore im talking about the charge coming straight from the bankcard to check funds in an account in which theyre already using your funds anyways i just dont see a justifiable business decision to do so other than taking advantage of people in poverty there seems to be a common misunderstanding of what im referring to here my apologies for not making that clear in my original write up i am not referring to the owner of the atm charging fees for use of the atm  what im referring to is when your own bank charges a separate fee outside of the atm owner for example when you use an atm youll often get a notification that goes something like this the owner of this atm charges a 250 transaction fee in addition to the fees applied by your own financial institution the bolded italic is specifically what im referring to here,1,284,1613,99,0.0707070707070707
cmv if god is omnipotent and omniscient and creator of everything it would have to be incredibly cruel,"omnipotent would mean it can do anything in the system it created omniscient would have to mean it can completely predict anything that happens in the system it created created everything means it created every system there is  these two then the sufferings in the world have to be permitted  in some way by god even if you call it not intervening because it will be able to predict the sufferings beforehand based on the kind of system its creating after that not doing anything while being able to do is cruel to make matters worse if god created everything every kind of suffering there is the possibility of them would also have to be created by it and that potential seen beforehand

 10 hours after posting a lot of people commented and still commenting a lot of them are pretty elaborate considering my routine at the moment it would take considerable time for me to get through all of them please leave your comments the notifications are coming if the thread isn’t closed by admins i will go through everything whatever the time it takes you until now the responses ive seen can be summarized into this  sufferings we perceive is needed by this creator figure for its goal a goal none of us has the ability to comprehend but is likely moral response  we are talking about an omnipotent omniscient being that created everything about reality a reality we every life experience a lot of sufferings are part of this experience whether they are only from our perspective a creator that created everything in reality including our mind would still predict and design what this sufferings are and what they feel like or at least things that make them possible so whether theres an ultimate reason or the nature of sufferings is subjective the sufferings and the way its felt by life is still there and is the result of a being that would have to be the prime example of free will acting the way it wants want not need so criticism like this is still valid 
an analogy  you create some beings in what is a fully controlled and predictable environment to you these beings experience something similar to sufferings end justifies the means doesn’t make you choosing to start this not needing and allowing even if subjective ailments not cruel for the fact that your hand wasn’t forced and the sufferings of your subjects had to be knowingly signed of by you",1,422,2466,105,0.0380952380952381
cmv race based affirmative action should be abolishedreplaced with socioeconomic based affirmative action,"i believe that race based affirmative action in college admissions should be abolished or replaced with socioeconomic affirmative action for the reasons listed below different topics will be listed by alphabetical letters and different contentions by numbers for the ease of reference i will abbreviate affirmative action to aa and underrepresented minority to urm all of my underscored texts are direct quotes from the linked source bit on my background i am around 75 pacific islander and 25 east asian i spent most of my 112 education at an east asian country i will refer to it as country x i have a dual nationality americancountry x i have been to 8 different schools from elementary to my current stage and i am now a college freshman relevant to given topic for reference i do not support legacy admissionsdonor advantage and i support athlete recruits i see it as merit based a mastery of physical education if you will social mobility i believe race based aa does not provide the social mobility some claim i have seen people argue that urms are on average on the lower end of the social class and race based aa would make the situation better now lets take 4 hypothetical students a rich white student a rich black student a poor white student and a poor black student now lets assume wealth is correlated to academic performance and the rich black student performs similar to the poor white student harvard can take in 2 students so who gets in most likely the richer white and black students as the rich white kid performs the best and the rich black kid and poor white kid have similar academic performance but aa breaks the deal and now if race based aa is replaced with socioeconomic based aa the deal breaker would turn in favor of the poor white kid thus achieving social mobility now magnify the four studetns into 4 groups of 2 different social class and 2 different race the same situation would apply  elite private schools would still fill up its cohorts with the 2 upper class groups while the 2 lower class groups remains rejected this is why race based aa does nothing to aid social mobility
2 in harvard and other elite private schools to a similar extent rich students outnumbering lowincome ones 23 to 1 quite the opposite of what you would expect for affirmative action isnt it this is inherently a statistical backing to 1 which shows that most urms in elite private schools would still be rich anyhow
3 most importantly combating social immobility cannot be done by giving a easier pass to college the poor black kid from 1 and the vast majority of those who are genuinely disadvantaged will never make it to the doors of elite colleges no matter what better education starts from elementary middle school and high school  reform the trashy public schools where a handful of people get pregnant every yeara big portion of the class are under drug abuse etc social mobility will not happen when aa benefits the wealthiest and resourceful of each race renowned berkeley philosophy professor john searle believed that race based aa was a disaster “there was a huge dropout rate of affirmativeaction admits in my classes by midterms” searle added “no one had taught them the need to go to class so we started introducing bs majors in an effort to make the university ready for them rather than making them ready for the university”
4 uc berkeley tried to give an admissions preference to lowincome students this device backfired however when it yielded a wealth of eastern european and vietnamese admits — not the kind of “diversity” that the university had in mind so the campuses cut their new socioeconomic preferences in half and went back to the drawing board
5 just to bring in some name clout martin luther king jr argued that a bill of rights for the disadvantaged would disproportionately benefit black people who “form the vast majority of america’s disadvantaged” at the same time it was appropriate for poor whites to benefit king said because they suffer deprivation if not racial discrimination “it is a simple matter of justice that america in dealing creatively with the task of raising the negro from backwardness should also be rescuing a large stratum of the forgotten white poor” he wrote campus diversity categorizing asians whites blacks latinos respectively into one single racialcontinent sized group is a completely foolish and lazy way of classification lets take the asian category it consists of indians pakistanis chinese japanese malays koreans indonesians taiwanese vietnamese laotians bangladeshis singaporeans a mix of its own hk chinese filipinos etc each of them with vastly different ethnicity anthropology history and sometimes even skin color of their own countries like vietnam hong kong philipines india etc were all colonized at some point and might have more similarity to their european colonizers than their neighbors quite ironic that the best anthropologists and historians come from the same institution that failed to realize such basic fact innit
2 building on 1 race  ethnicity if youre looking for diversity ethnicity is closer to actual behaviouralcultural diversity than race race refers to a persons physical characteristics such as bone structure and skin hair or eye color ethnicity however refers to cultural factors including nationality regional culture ancestry and language
3 building on 2 identity  ethnicity in essence your identity is what makes you unique from others your identity is probably the single most significant factor youre welcome to change my mind but at the same time identity incorporates social classenvironment ethnicityculture religion etc your skin colour is a subset of a subset of your identity and classifying diversity based on race is just again laziness
4 as i explained in the intro i have been to 8 schools in 3 continents from elementary to now as a college freshman most of them were in country x where i attended 2 local schools 2 privates schools and a private american school which is the most expensive one in country x while anecdotal my observation from my experience with all these different classmates was that no matter which continent i was in those who are richer and poorer behave similar to their own social class respectively regardless of their race my local school mates consisted of mostly lower and middle class and they tend spent money very very sparingly the spending culture of my private school mates was completely opposite they could afford to go clubbing every weekend some even started at 16 or 17 with fake ids while my local school mates never clubbed my private school mates were into netflix kendrick lamar giannis antetokounmpo etc while my local school mates were into baseball local celebrities localkorean tv shows anime etc my private school mates take 130usd per hour tutors5 student cram classes while my public school mates study on their ownattend lecture style 200 student per class cram schools in europe private school my school mates acted very similar to the rich school mates back in country x my point is behavioural culture of the same social class weighs more than that of the same race
5 ucscaltech do not perform race based aa yet i have never heard anything negative about their campus life with regards to diversity besides caltech being quirky due to its stem only environment berkeley is especially notable for being one of the most progressive institutions in the world and a diverse ideological pioneer of society why is it a problemfor schools performing aa racism ive seen arguments about how racist bullies prevent urms from excelling academics however the us today is definitely progressed enough for everyone to frown upon racists and hard core kkk style racists are generally widely condemned as for subtle racism it happens to all races to blacks latinos arabs counted as white in college apps asians rasianmasculinity and even whites dumb blonde jokes stereotypes exists for everyone and from my experiences with tons of urms and being a minority in country x racism is a taboo no matter how much of a pillock someone is also it is impossible to quantify racism so an admission guideline based on it would be too incompetent to reflect any realistic situation
2 race based aa stirs more racism a chinese friend of mine studied in a public magnate school in florida he was the valedictorian class president president of a few clubs officer of a student government in his local region 2nd place in local math competition not olympiad tho he got rejected from every t15 he applied to except upenn thank god he has a very passive personality but from talking to him i can tell that he still holds a slight grudge because a black classmate of his got into his dream skl ea but still applied to all kinds of t15s on the rd round and he thinks that he wouldve had a good chance if the black student stopped applying after getting into his dream school he also strongly believes that the black kid got in to uchicago columbia stanford dartmouth etc over him because he is black not because of his merit or have a personality colleges are looking for i of course believe that it is wrong to place any blame atundermine the black student but the fact is my friends grudge and opinion about the black student was a combination of his believing that aa played a part and that there are quotas in his public school normally only 1 get into hypsm every year
3 on the micro individual level race based aa is indirectly racist towards whitesasians since if one worked extremely hard to achieve the academic performance and extracurricular but still fails to get in knowing that people who are less qualified get in because of their race it is only natural for them to feel imbalanced or even a target of institutionalized racism i have seen people on reddit claiming that they or their friends mischose their race then their offer got rescinded after contacting colleges the current race based aa is too incompetent to combat social mobility and institutionalized racism and diversity is a false axiom you probably can see i hold a strong opinion on affirmative action and i welcome any different perspective as long as it makes sense",1,1735,11363,107,0.08411214953271028
cmvpeople who are morbidly obese shouldnt get handicap parking passes or any other handicap benefits,"everyday i see morbidly obese 300lbs people parking in handicap spaces and taking advantage of access to handicap benefits i believe that these people would greatly benefit from having to walk into places they want to go into doctors should stop coddling people with weight problems and promote healthy lifestyle changes starting with little and easily accomplished tasks obesity is an epidemic in this country usa and we need to take every possible way to combat it i am by no way fat shaming anybody but being overweight can lead to alot more health problems than people actually realize letting these people take the easy way out when it comes to traveling or using things actual handicap people need is very disheartening i wish these people would get help with their problems i realize theres a medical aspect to it as well like glandular issues and thyroid issues but these are just crutches people with eating disorders use to justify the 4000 calories they take in in a day medicine has come so far there are possible ways to maintain your weight they just have to be willing to accept the criticism and find the will power to overcome whatever is weighing them down pun not intended  grammatical errors  i know this has only been up for a few hours but thank you everyone for your wonderful thought out responses i understand a few new points of view on the subject for example my standpoint on the at fault argument it is possible that people who are obese became obese because of an underlying disability or mental ailment causing them to gain weight  these people i personally wouldnt have a problem if they had a handicap pass however i also do realize for what its worth i as an individual am no way going to change the laws or legislation about handicap pass accessibility ultimately its up to doctors discretion on who or who does not get a parking pass or any other handicap benefit

cmv it is no longer safe to be a male primary school teacher,im male i am a trained and 18 year experienced teacher i teach in primary school elementary and i am the only male teacher in the primary school i am considering leaving teaching because i no longer feel that it is a safe working environment for a male quick background about who i am i need to mention this because it is our current cultural climate is very polarized im proud to say that i come from a nuclear free south pacific country i currently live in germany and see myself as european im a well traveled teacher of young kids so like most europeans like me we are liberal in other words to americans away from the coastal cities im pretty much a fake capitalist who is really a communist choose to teach young children because i find it the most rewarding job it isnt like i cant do other jobs i love addicted some say to learning so i also have degrees in geography computer science programming 3d movie animation padi divemaster and on top of that i am a lead designer of fully autonomous drones for a engineering company here in germany most of these skills i can use to make a lot more money than the low pay you get in primary teaching but i am who i am my personally suits working with small children i am the male teacher that children love  im often known as my favourite teacher in class they say i am strict but yell the least off all the teachers told that today from my head teacher who interviewed the children im a bit loony okay loony actor is my style i teach through positive reinforcement exstudents on facebook as teenagers or young adults always request me as friend and often thank me personally  im good at this job and each time my teaching has been officially observed i have only received excellence okay once i did get a good i know males are needed in primary school and it is my civic duty to help the next generations grow into well rounded people i am afraid im afraid that one allegation against my character will ruin my life i am aware of this i have taken training for male teachers on how to keep yourself safe i am never in a room alone with a child i will leave the room if the child wont leave i never walk alone just with one child i always make sure i do as much as i can to keep myself safe i am making sure the children no longer can hug me even though it is what they need and at the same time a tool teachers use to build a personal rapport with the child i try and fail still to leave the emotional parts to the female teachers the years i have watch how things have changed parents no longer trust teachers as they did only ten years ago its got worse i believe the brett kavanaugh hearing in the last 10 days has been my final tipping point quick note here remember im liberal european so kavanaugh judiciary practice goes against my core personal beliefs here  is a man who has worked in public office for over 20 years is a leader of hiring women in the courts has documented proof in the forms of in a calendardiary in who he met and what he did can get 65 women from his high school days to vouch for him within one day has written testimony from all those involved saying they have never met to go along with the calendar female friend choosing him to discuss their own sexually harassment and along with a lot more facts that can be proven yet in spite of having a clean history with support he has been accused of being guilty by the media celebrities and political leaders all before hearing his side of the story whats worse and the thing that is breaking the camels back is that the ordinary people who share my core beliefs were the strongest in condemning him and believing her before anything had been said on both sides now after the testimony where the facts were heard it is still seen as credible that he did something she provided no extra facts about that night apart from emotion yet when i read most of the media i see that they still support her scares me it scares me so much that i want to leave teaching im not brett kavanaugh i dont have records of my daily activities id struggle to find 5 women from school to sign a letter saying the nice guy i was in high school i was the geek loony guy  girls liked the strong sports type more hell ive got drunk and past out a few times and yes ive kissed a lot of girls ive seen how parents are i have noticed how the people i am around the most firmly believe her over him even when he presents facts to back up his claim is it really worth it one claim and no matter how i have acted what proof i have i have seen from this hearing and many more in the past few years that my life and that of my family will be ruined is the start of autumn holidays i love being a teacher but i am thinking of handing my notice in help me change my mind  please mention if you are male or female i am hoping it helps me see each gender perspective 2 thank you all for your comments i have

cmv a person dying should not exempt them from negative opinion,this view has largely been sparked by the passing of xxxtentacion and has caused much controversy in my area  the idea that speaking ill of the dead is wrong and abhorrent seems like an aged and counterproductive concept  why should someone notably those of questionable character and impact be suddenly free of all criticism simply because they are now dead  i obviously understand the social implications of speaking ill of say someones deceased son  however if that son were a character of questionable morality criminal warped views etc then perhaps i could see reason in doing so  this taboo is certainly a sensitive subject but should find no place in constructive dialogue hope i have made my view clear  many different posts have all found a typical agreement that i can get behind there should be a period of time however long it may be where the dead should be allowed time for family and friends can reflect and the world can reflect on the loss  i still firmly believe the dead should not be exempt from negative opinion but having that peace time feels important too,1,194,1114,64,0.1875

cmv the minimum wage should be based on an economic calculation not on a fixed dollar amount,the federal minimum wage is 725 as the economy moves up and down that number stays fixed almost as soon as it is adjusted it begins to be out of date this could be fixed by having the minimum wage based on an economic calculation for example it could be a calculation based on covering minimum living standards for shelter food and transportation the consumer price index could be used to adjust this value for local economies it would reset every six months or so would take it out of the political arena and make it a truly stable tool to keep the economy functioning dont i see this as part of the minimum wage conversation its always just  should we change it how much should it be is the counter argument to this added cpi as a factor in calculating minimum wage ∆ to 10ebbor10 for letting me know that this is part of the ongoing discourse,1,159,976,94,0.06382978723404255
cmv criminals should be rehabilitated not punished,i do not believe in retribution punishing someone because they deserve it i instead believe that criminals should be rehabilitated an actual honest effort made into making them a better person as this is more likely to prevent crimes and especially repeat offenses this obviously wont help prevent crimes committed out of desperation but neither will punishment than punishments made for the purpose of deterring a person from committing a crime criminals often dont think of the consequences before committing a crime and many believe they will never get caught norway does this and it has a much lower crime rate and repeat offense rate than nations like the usa where criminals are sent to prison edit i would like to include again that i believe that retribution is absolutely morally wrong regardless of the circumstances and has no redeemable qualities whatsoever the point of justice is to prevent suffering not cause it,1,153,951,53,0.07547169811320754
cmv the term white trash is underdiscussed for how truly offensive and derogatory it truly is in wokeclassaware culture,this term is fascinating to me because unlike other extremely offensive racially or class derogatory terms it actually describes its intentions in the term itself  trash and having grown up in appalachia i feel like ive become increasingly aware over the last few years of the potential damage that the term inflicts on the perception of lowerclass often white appalachian culture it feels like the casual usage of the term and its clearlydefined intention is maybe more damaging to white workingclass culture than we give it and diminished some of the very real very difficult social problems that it implies it presumes sovereignty over situational hardship and diminishes the institutional issues that need to be dealt with to solve them hilary clintons whole deplorable thing a few years back shined a light on the issue and i think theres an inherent relationship between the implied disposability of the people in area from the term white trash itself yet ive never really heard a push to reconsider that term and i dont really understand why it almost feels too obvious for it not to have happened on the scale it deserves   i just want to say that i appreciate everyones responses and genuinely insightful conversation and sharing of experiences throughout this whole thread i love this sub for that reason and i think this is really a valuable dialogue and conversation about many of the sides of this argument that i havent genuinely considered thank you,1,248,1506,126,0.047619047619047616

cmv fixedamount monetary fines for favor the rich and should instead be based on a percentage of the offenders income or net worth,"imagine this scenario the drivers of a lamborghini and a beaten up 1996 honda civic are both parked illegally the offence carries a fixed fine of 200 
for the driver of the lamborghini 200 is pocket change while for the civic owner this amount could be the difference between being able to pay rent and homelessness 
this example could instead be applied to speeding running a red light or any other offence traffic or otherwise that carries a fixedamount monetary fine and the sentiment of my point is still the same  view was inspired by a reddit comment in which a commenter’s  wealthy friend responded to a reminder that they were parking illegally with words to the effect of “its not illegal it just costs 200” judging by the road behavior i see from drivers of luxury and exotic cars i’d guess that this mindset is widespread among wealthier people  view is that fixed monetary punishments for minor offences disproportionately impact poorer offenders and don’t do much to deter those with the ability to easily pay them  i propose that a more equitable approach of financial punishments is to base fines on the income or net worth of the offender so that the punishment for a crime carries the same proportional impact on the offender regardless of their socioeconomic status this would mean that a 200 fine for someone making 20000 a year would scale so that a person making 10 million a year would pay 100000 for the same offence change my view",1,258,1490,132,0.022727272727272728

cmv human labor should inherently be worth a living wage,"i saw a pretty popular comment on a thread on reddit earlier today with a lot of comments like “if you don’t like your pay why don’t you just get a new job” and “if you’re getting paid less than 15 an hour it’s because your labor isn’t worth 15 an hour and you should learn new skills to get a better job” while i obviously understand supply and demand i think this is an incredibly privileged and ignorant viewpoint who would choose to work for 10 an hour when there’s an easy way they could get paid 15 an hour those options don’t exist for people caught in poverty i think having a minimum wage that greater than or equal to a living wage is a moral imperative 
 me human labor has inherent value regardless of skill 40 hours of completely unskilled human labor is still 40 hours of someone’s time and they deserve to be able to afford food and shelter when slavery was legal slave owners still gave their slaves food and shelter under wage slavery those things aren’t even necessarily a given so to me if your business can’t afford pay a living wage it shouldn’t be in business lots of slave owners were financially screwed after emancipation but that doesn’t morally justify slavery so why is it okay for a business owner to say “we can’t afford to pay a living wage” 
 there’s the issue where the government subsidizes the wages of low income employees with ebt and medicaid this allows companies to rely on the government to prop their business up while they hoard money and exploit workers ceos are essentially siphoning money from the government to pay for new cars and boats and stuff
 a living wage in no way includes airpods yachts mansions etc a living wage just means enough to be able to cover basic needs without government or family assistance right now minimum wage is not at that level 
 i’m talking about labor that is sold of course the labor that comes from scratching your ass or making yourself a sandwich does not have to be compensated you’re not selling that labor that is not what “labor” means in this context

cmv when hanging out with friends it is rude to speak a language not everyone in the group can understand,"hello cmv before anything i wanna give a bit of context im brazilian and this specific social situation happened to me often particularly in two moments the first being when i lived in england and the second is right now that im living in china

 was in england through a brazilian scholarship which means that i was there with a rather big group of brazilians and whenever there were gettogethers that involved people from other countries a rather big portion of my friends would insist in speaking portuguese our first language for those who dont know while there were people around us that obviously couldnt understand everyone in the brazilian group had at least a decent enough level of english so there was no real excuse for speaking portuguese other than sheer laziness if i was participating the conversation id simply force switching to english in other to include people that couldnt understand portuguese and right now im in the other end im the one that cant understand the groups language im learning chinese but my level still simply isnt enough to follow a conversation between locals and respond fast enough i can understand the topic and agree or disagree or add something if someone ask me directly but its just still really frustrating to follow a conversation entirely in chinese and exactly like it happened with my brazilian friends most of my chinese friends while having at least a good understanding of english they insist in having long discussions in chinese while im sitting in front of them

 get me wrong since im studying chinese thats the perfect opportunity for me actually use what i learn in very real life situation and this is great my local friends are lovely people and im sure they dont mean to exclude me plus as i added in my first experience my brazilian friends did exactly the same thing if not worse cause at least my friends here are aware i study chinese but my point here is how thats something easily ignored by people so yeah i personally hate this situation to my core and i wish i could see it as something normal rather than rude please change my view i just woke up and will start replyinggiving deltas while i commute it will take a bit to go through the answers
 2 a few people are focusing a lot on my examples especially in my experience in china so first thing im close enough to my local friends to be aware of their level so i know how much they can speak and i honestly dont think theyre particularly rude to me when we first met it did bother me a bit more but i sucked it up and nowadays that my level is a bit higher and were much closer i dont care as much it doesnt change the fact however that i think the action by itself is somewhat rude and often overlooked by society and thats not country related even if some cultures are more likely to act like this for some reason as it seems the case from some comments im only using this as an example on how people easily close themselves in country bubbles when living abroad which is related to the discussion but its another topic therefore ditching entirely the courtesy of speaking a second language when the person is able to so that you dont isolate your fellow nonspeaker",1,578,3330,107,0.037383177570093455

cmv a main reason why kids dont do as well in school as they could is that they dont get enough sleep and they do not take enough breaks to even simply breath,most people know that sleep is important and necessary but so few actually get what they need a lot of kids will stay up way to late because either they put off the homework until later or they do nore than they need they either cram for a test they dont need to study over an hour for or do more work for whatever project they have to do  know a lot of people have a lot of homework but even if you dont get home until 6 and have to eat you shouldnt have over 4 hours of homework  also dont take the breaks they need they might think that since they have so much homework they need to stay up and do it nonstop to finish faster but it actually causes you to take longer taking just 5 minutes so sit and breath or get some water refreshes your brain and when you go back you can go much faster and more efficienct,1,167,841,163,0.024539877300613498
cmv parties are for politicians citizens should remain independent and register as such,"ill be using ‘we’ to refer to ‘we the people’
and ‘theythem’ to refer to those in positions of power
 don’t always talk politics  but when i do i say screw both parties and usually the people i talk to agree whichever way they lean  they might have reasons for why this party is ‘the lesser evil’ but i haven’t come across many people who are genuinely happy with either party  if you are happy with one of the two parties id love to hear about it as an r or d is effectively voting ahead of time and publicly  your now in a category of person who is active politically and can be assigned a color your vote should be earned and you shouldn’t make up your mind ahead of time  your also being factored into political data which is used to strategize how to win a state or district and has moved away from anything remotely resembling a genuine presentation of political policy as independent is a far more effective means of protesting the two party system rather than doing nothing  a rising number of independent voters would affect the political strategy of both sides  elections are won by slim margins and a substantial independent voting block would make it harder to play the game and harder to play around the party lines they might even have to start saying what they really think but let’s not get carried away and liberal values are both essential for a healthy society and we should all be more open in discussing what each side is good at and bad at rather than blaming and demonizing the opponent  a third and better yet unaffiliated group would help to break up the back and forth  of essentially asking the politicians to change through protests we the people need to change how we interact politically and make them adapt to us  the redblue binary has evolved around our opinions and we need to stop giving out free information  you genuinely believe in your party and want to put your support out there i won’t tell you not to  but consider the tinge of inauthenticity that often accompanies public displays  publicly displaying your religious affiliation without being asked or beating some drum is often an attempt to gain attention and acquire affirmation to gird your own lack of faith or some other motive  keep your beliefs personal and private what you believe is best shown through action and it will become obvious if your words contradict them this country was designed around the idea that democracy requires citizens to be skeptical of those in power  skepticism should be your default  do not back a parties nominee simply because of their affiliation or because you’ll never vote for ‘the other guys’  we set the tone and the blame for this political divide can be laid at our feet for playing into it for so long  if a substantial independent block came out of the woodwork we would also have more independent politicians come out of that movement let’s change the narrative rise above the binary and claim independence from the two party system register independent don’t give away your opinion too easily or atleast keep them guessing to be a good op i’ve read most and appreciate the feedback wish i had more time to respond to each  i realize why we have two parties and how it developed i realize registering is a way to engage with your chosen party and have your say in the primaries and work with what we have in place  it is my position that our willing participation is being used against us to stay one step ahead of public opinion probably developed by trying to stay ahead of the other side or idk who or what started it but now both parties are deeply invested in controlling the narrativesand no i dont think this is new phenomena i’m not gonna dive into this you either see it or you don’t i’ve observed so far is that it’s pretty easy to guess where someone is at leftcenterright by the comments alone  i believe this is mostly because the two parties while not homogeneous are essentially adapted to appeal to all that we hold sacred depending on your personality a and b if you like  both sides do it  it has been beneficial to my perspective and how i examine politics as a whole to say ‘i am independent’ and i will assume nothing as best i can because i know nothing  i hear people assert republicans are by association or somehow inherently racist like it’s a given and plenty of people on the right think a lot of liberals are godless sadists who actually enjoy getting abortions  whatever the example you want it’s all fucking wrong extreme views are almost always wrong or oddities presented as common that person across the aisle is standing there because they believe in something that matters just like you do but we can’t seem to communicate about it anymore  we’ve divulged into a state of total noncooperation  the two parties are like the left and right brain two brains one body and they can’t communicate anymore that’s a problem choose to be independent because my conscience cannot allow me to be apart of this ‘pick your poison’ dilemma  i also cannot burry my head in the sand  this is a solution i see that helped me look at things with less bias and i’m not expecting it to be revolutionary or even new but we are all responsible for everything so just think twice about who you blame things on the easiest way to be completely and totally wrong about something is to be convinced you are right  also thanks for the insults toward my intelligence live long and

cmv politics is a good reason to end a relationship,i remember there being a small rash of news stories about couples some married for years breaking up in the wake up of the trump election as a result of who people voted for a similar thing happened on a smaller level with brexit in the uk  was met with a lot of comments from people in news sites saying that was a stupid reason to break up but i disagree  politics isnt just a game politicians play or something that happens away from the world political views reveal a lot about beliefs on society rights justice and basically political views are very intertwined with personal morality  a partner who challenges you is good but wide differences are a legitimate break in a relationship i would argue the couple who broke up after years of marriage in the wake of the american election didnt break up trivially because political parties  suddenly became important but that theyd ignored that aspect of their relationship if neither was interested in politics and the election revealed some very deep personal divides which were irreconcilable political differences can be a make or break aspect of a relationship and justifiably so ,1,200,1178,52,0.07692307692307693

cmv humanity has yet to master or even invent a form of governmenteconomy that would sustain us as a species on a massive scale indefinitely in outer space,"first let’s presume a few things humanity will eventually have to venture off this planet if we are to survive as a species because earth is a very volatile place and could eradicate us fairly easily given the long view of its history  we have mastered the technology to create and maintain massive self contained environments powered by finite and renewable resources whether they be large scale space stations or planetary habitats  we have mastered medicine agriculture and any other technologies required for our species to flourish and survive indefinitely in such an environment 

      i hold this view because we do in a way already live on a sort of space station with finite and renewable resources and seem to be living in a very unsustainable way i see our time here on earth as a sort of practice run for the big game out amongst the starts i guess as of right now we don’t stand a chance specifically in terms of governing people and economies in a mutually beneficial and sustainable manner

cmv prostitution or escort call it whatever you want should be fully legal as long as no human traffic was involved and everybody consented,correct me if im wrong but i believe right now in many parts of western nations usa included prostitution is illegal even escort is considered at best as semilegal and can still often be shut down if government deems that sex is explicitly involved believe the two main arguments for why this is so is because of human traffic and health for human traffic i find this a poor argument because you dont ban prostitution simply because a part of prostitution is sponsored by human traffic its not fair to the rest of prostitution which does not involve human traffic analogy is like how you dont ban alcohol simply because some people abuse it  if human traffic is a problem then fix that directly without making a blanket ban for health argument it is also a poor argument because by that logic i can claim anything which leads to poor health should be banned should we ban hivpeople from having sex should we ban obese people from eating mcdonalds government doesnt have a say in how people should live their lives including risky behaviors to ban it completely due to health reasons is ridiculous i miss anything else feel free to comment and ill see if that can change my mind  what would not change my mind is moral argument like oh its a sin or its morally bad to treat sex so casually,1,236,1383,143,0.027972027972027972
cmv plea deals are a symptom of how broken our justice system is,when defendants have to choose between spending years more of their life in jail if they want to contest their innocence it is a sign that something is horribly wrong when prosecutors have discretion to add on more or less charges to force these deals they are being granted way too much power over these people’s lives currently lack enough judges lawyers and court rooms to handle all of the cases that might occur if plea deals were not so widely used but maybe that implies that we are not increasing the supply of qualified people quickly enough if it is hard to increase the supply because people are difficult to train maybe we need to figure out how to simplify parts of our justice system so more people can really have their day in court in our age of information technology it is crazy that this industry has not gotten more efficient incentive for getting people to save society’s resources makes sense maybe there should be a monetary cost to going to trial or a monetary reward maybe spending time in a slightly nicer prison for agreeing to a plea deal but when people are forced to put years of their life on the line to contest their innocence then something is really wrong with our system,1,218,1238,66,0.06060606060606061
cmv much like jealousy or envy feeling offended is something everyone should work to get rid off,feeling offended i wish there was a single word for it is in a terrible feeling to be had because it 1 implies people can make you feel things instead of feelings being the result of your interpretation of events 2 breeds misunderstandings and conflict and 3 makes people feel like they dont need to work on their problems or insecurities because they can always twist the responsability towards the other person caviats i realize there is a big difference between being offended by some casual comment that comes off wrong and being offended by someone who actively is trying to offend you however i think the first situation could very easily be solved by talking honestly and feeling offended in the second one is only a reflection of insecurities because you can judge someones bad behavior without feeling offended think people only feel offended when they think what the person says has some power over them if its racism they feel undermined if its about beauty they feel insecure and so on if you use this feeling to guide yourself into becoming happier with who you are instead of being worried about how to make people not say those things youd be much happier things in this case yourself is much better than destroying even if the thing youre destroying is indeed bad,1,224,1338,99,0.04040404040404041

cmv its hypocritical to simultaneously believe that 1 people should have to pull themselves up by their bootstraps if theyre unsuccessful and 2 we should make any effort to support people who have lost their coalfactoryindustry jobs due to technological progress,the big argument ive seen for supporting industries like the coal industry is that failing to support those industries results in tremendous job loss and the further deterioration of the working class of america  i dont necessarily disagree with the facts of that argument i think its probably true it seems hypocritical to me that a lot of the support for keeping these industries alive come from the right which is ostensibly the side of the political aisle that believes in the free market and the fact that people who have lost their jobs should just get another one or people who are poor just arent working hard enough it seems weird to me that a rightwing individual would look at a coal miners family living in poverty in west virginia and think of them any differently than a family living in poverty in queens shouldnt they all just figure out a way to make more money thats what a lot of people in queens and lots of other inner cities are told by the right is somewhat connected to the recent discussions of daca  it also seems weird to me that the right wants to send away from america the people who seem to embody the american dream of pulling themselves up by their bootstraps and getting an educationjobetc the big argument against daca and illegal immigrants is that they take jobs but againwhy should any right wing person have sympathy for people who are losing their jobs to immigrants be better at your job accept lower pay and work two jobs  anyone reconcile these two ways of thinking,1,273,1565,269,0.011152416356877323

cmv pete buttigieg is correct that bernie sanders medicare for all plan has a 50 trillion dollar price tag that simply cannot be explained away,"he challenged bernie on this twice during the debate last night and bernie did not challenge the assertion or give any new explanation to explain the massive gap i found a transcript of the exchange here it is but im actually less concerned about the lack of transparency on sanders personal health than i am about the lack of transparency on how to pay for his health care plan since hes said that its impossible to even know how much its going to cost and even after raising taxes on everybody making 29000 there is still a multitrilliondollar hole  
  
as a matter of fact if you add up all his policies altogether they come to 50 trillion hes only explained 25 trillion worth of revenue which means that the hole in there is bigger than the size of the entire economy of the united states the time has come to level with the american people on matters personal and on matters of policy but where is  where is the other 25 trillion supposed to come from at a certain point youve got to do the math  
  
sanders well we got it all up there on the internet its a payroll tax  a payroll tax  
  
buttigieg well no but even after the payroll tax you still have a hole  
  
sanders because we have a wealth tax elizabeth has a good one ours is a little bit tougher on mr bloomberg than hers were going to raise it in a progressive way which deals with income and wealth inequality and makes certain finally that health care in this country is a human right not a privilege warrren has also had a hard time explaining this plan which is very similar to bernies as i understand it the debate as throughout the campaign warren refused to provide any specifics about how she would fund a singlepayer plan instead whether questioned by moderators or challenged by other candidates she recycled variants on the same talking points she has used in venues from campaign town halls to a recent appearance on the late show with stephen colbert rather than explaining what revenue she would raise to fund the plan warren insisted that under single payer middleincome families would save more money with the elimination of healthcare premiums copays and deductibles regardless of any taxes imposed “costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations and for hardworking middleclass families costs will go down” she said at the debate seems pretty clear to me that both warren and sanders have a very hard time explaining how theyre going to pay for medicare for all when theyre pressed for specifics or to explain away that 25 trillion dollar gap as mayor pete pointed out they dont have a good answer or refuse to answer my view this is damning maybe someone can help them out",1,494,3019,146,0.04794520547945205
cmv the idea of “believe all women” in regards to sexual assault doesn’t really make sense and or doesn’t mean anything,so once again a claim of sexual assault has become a big story and this point occurred to me and i’d like to hear what other people thing  i dont understand why anyone would say “believe all women” or “we should believe women automatically” are you saying that there should be a different legal standard in sexual assault rape cases ie guilty until proven innocent if so that is an interesting if legally unfounded opinion if you think that we should take sexual assault allegations more seriously than that’s a valid opinion but ultimately if a woman makes a credible claim of sexual assault people tend to listen granted not always in the same way that people listen if you say you were physically assaulted in a practical sense if you go to the police in good faith and report a crime they have no reason not to believe you now again if the issue is that you think there is misconduct and a given case isn’t being taken seriously enough than thats a valid point and one that i’m interested in that said my main belief is that “believe all women” doesn’t really make sense and people should stop saying it besides that i would be interested to hear what other people think that phrase means or why it might be useful in discourse,1,226,1269,122,0.040983606557377046
cmv fascist and nazi as insults are widely overused completely misunderstood by those who use them and should almost never be used if one wants to be taken seriously,to start of i am not talking about obvious nazi or fascist movements like blood and honor golden dawn etc which certainly deserve this title nor am i talking about idiotic young nazis who run around with tikitorches who do the heil hitler salute believe that if most people hear nazifascist they think racism antiantisemitism führer which is obviously not wrong in the sense that all these things are true but they dont capture the ideologies behind it  socialism and fascism were both historic movements deeply rooted in their times one of the most important ideological pillars of the nazi movement was that of lebensraum important enough to be understood by most english speakers they had a very weird and confusing position regarding christianity and last but not least their economic policies were equally complex and inconsistent but shouldnt be left out of the picture there is much more than to mention here most people dont give a fuck about those details which is fair but they also shouldnt call people nazi without understanding what that actually means these things and more should be taken into consideration when deciding to call someone a nazi or a fascist that i am not saying that to protect the feelings of the poor victims of these accusations i think that those words slowly lose the horrific message they still carry if you say i met a nazi the other day do you mean some racist who thinks we should close borders and only allow white immigration or a guy who laughed about the holocaust and said we should have gotten more of them i am honestly baffled that people dont see a real difference here not to dispute that both people are assholes at least from my perspective  in gods name did attributes like racist antisemite authoritarian antidemocrat became so harmless that you have to call someone a nazi because they just dont do anymore convinced yet maybe ask yourself when to call someone a nazi and when to use the term fascist are they completely interchangeable is nazism a certain form of fascism as i think if so what does make guygirl xyz a nazi not a fascist where do the japanese fit in people dont have a clue what nazism and fascism really are most people are neither if you wanna be taken seriously dont use that word as a random insult but instead fall back on attributes like racist etc which are more clearly defined and not dependent on multi faceted historic periods nice reading about one page from master orwell himself who puts it better than i ever could ,1,443,2701,171,0.029239766081871343

cmvalcoholics anonymous is heavily flawed from a scientific perspective and hasnt tried to improve its system since its inception,"i have a friend who has been attending aa meetings recently because he was ordered to do so in some fashion after getting a dui for the record i dont know if that means he was given a true option or made to attend or choose jailtime and the whole thing has got me thinking about whether or not aa works and if sobriety is even the intended outcome of the program below ive listed the famous 12 steps and below that are my relatively disorganized thoughts on the program having looked into it for the first time in any in depth manner this means that i’m still in the early stages of my views and can be very much subject to change	we admitted we were powerless over alcohol—that our lives had become unmanageable	came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity	made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of god as we understoodhim	made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves	admitted to god to ourselves and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs	were entirely ready to have god remove all these defects of character	humbly asked him to remove our shortcomings	made a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them all	made direct amends to such people wherever possible except when to do so would injure them or others	continued to take a personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it	sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with god as we understood him praying only for knowledge of his will for us and the power to carry that out	having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps we tried to carry this message to alcoholics and to practice these principles in all our affairs current view is that because of the lack of change of the steps over the years since the 30’s suggests a lack of improvement that would be unacceptable in any other field of treatment for diseases here are some of my thoughts on the matter up as many have pointed out theres a whole lot of god involved throughout the 12 steps 6 direct references and 7 if you count  im not sure how this is supposed to appeal to athiests such as my friend if a person does not believe in god they will be put off from the program from the start making it much harder to reach their goal of sobriety alcoholism is a disease then why does aa treat it simply as a matter of will power i wouldnt try to treat cancer with prayer alone and for the record there are various medical treatments for alcoholism  is also a stigma of personal failure when people relapse which doesnt make sense for a couple of reasons first if its a disease then people are sick which means that blaming them for not being able to control their health adds a layer of shame which can only do harm to the persons primary goal of getting sober in turn this will increase the time to get sober because it will add time to get over that shame before starting again shame does nothing to help get a person back on track as far as i can tell second you would never assign blame to a person with cancer who has gone into remission and then had the cancer come back why would we do the same for literally any other illness does not collect statistics of their success and failure rates nor has its program changed since its inception we wouldnt accept that from any other sort of treatment if we didnt collect that information we would still have the same poor treatment of hiv that we did in the 80s and 90s same goes for cancer and just about any other illness you can name i will say that talking about your issues with people is a good thing but as far as i can tell thats just about the only thing that that this program gets right everything else seems to be heavily flawed from a scientific perspective if not outright illogical  it seems that aa believes it’s program is a one size fits all program when we know that many ailments require different treatments for different people this is especially true for ailments that affect people mentally which i think it’s safe to say that addiction falls under that same umbrella people deal with various addictions in different ways why aa treats alcohol as a one size fits all approach i can’t say maybe i’m wrong but based on the text of their twelve steps and twelve promises that doesn’t seem to be the case instead they seem to say that the only reason people fail is because the fail to give themselves over fully to the program which seems to be very very odd

cmv five years later michael brown was not a victim of police brutality and is a horrible icon for the blm antipolice brutality movement,tomorrow is the five year anniversary of the shooting of michael brown by officer darren wilson and for almost the entirety of the last five years ive seen him put up on some kind of pedestal as a virtuous victim of yet another racist shooting of an innocent black man this has been going on since literally hours after the shooting when the first riots and protests started till today npr is currently doing a five years later special multipart series on how ferguson was impacted by browns death which prompted me to make this post his shooting inspired nationwide riots and protests murals of him have been made he was on the cover of a time magazine al sharpton spoke at his funeral obama name dropped him in speeches as some kind of innocent victim of police brutality and offering condolences to his family  dude strong arm robbed a liquor store for blunt wraps the responding officer was originally quite reasonable until brown assaulted him a struggle ensued in which brown manhandled and beat the officer while trying to take his gun a shot went off and brown ran wilson not wanting this clearly violent criminal to escape pursued then brown turned on wilson and charged since it was already clear at this point that wilson had no chance in a physical altercation and wilson only had his gun on him he did the only thing that made sense he shot brown and had to empty most of a magazine into brown before he finally went down  a guy like that among supposedly genuine victims of police brutality just weakens the cause it makes me wonder if the victim standard is really so low what precisely the movement is fighting for anyone who wants to champion an antipolice brutality movement needs to distance themselves from brown and all the outrage his death caused or risk having their own credibility tarnished since theyre clearly willing to defend violent criminals just because the skin color of the criminal and the officer fits a narrative whelp i was hoping this would get some attention but it has now wayyy surpassed my ability to handle apologies ill try to get to everyone at some point in the next couple days but many of you have written very long replies or given me hundred page reports to read up on so it might take a while for those thinking of leaving a top level comment i might suggest hopping on one of the very interesting comment threads already going on  thanks much to all those who provided delta inducing comments and im sure there are plenty more i havent found yet,1,450,2579,140,0.06428571428571428

cmv toxic masculinity exists just as tangibly as toxic femininity and its unreasonable to focus on one over the other,first i should explain my definition of each term as everyone seems to interpret it differently  refers to any substance or behaviour that due to its excess causes harm is a collection of traits that are traditionally attributed to males due to their increased prevalence in males as opposed to females is a collection of traits that are traditionally attributed to females due to their increased prevalence in females as opposed to males i recently came across a youtube video about a conversation between feminists and mens rights activists the topic of the existence of toxic masculinity struck a chord with me  male characteristics such as aggressive behaviour stoic demeanour and selfassurance are all characteristics that when exhibited in excess can be toxic that much i agree with this i believe that these traits can be exhibited in a toxic manner by females despite it never being mentioned furthermore these traits in regulation are incredibly helpful in certain situations example controlled aggression can be equated with being forward and honest overcoming fear through bravery does require an aggressive approach as opposed to a passive one acting stoic and masking emotions is important in negotiations when speaking in public when in difficult situations and when accomplishing tasks that outbursts of emotion would hinder said feminine traits share similar pitfalls and advantages in my mind they are both equally important traits to posses and regulate why is one plastered all over the media while the other one isnt im of the opinion that its because feminism the movement that coined the term toxic masculinity benefits more from pointing out the flaws in behaviours more frequently seen in men who make up a minority of feminist groups than from doing the same to flaws frequently seen in women who make up the majority of said groups find this bias to be unreasonable and even harmful as it demonises men in an unfair manner ive never seen any prominent figure so much as mention toxic femininity much less explain why it is not as relevant to talk about as its masculine counterpart is where i hope that reddit comes in can you offer some insight with regards to the validity of one topic after another maybe theres a train of thought i havent considered yet beyond plain confirmation bias of feminists andor tribalism i consider myself an egalitarian so i dont have anything against feminism itself just the behaviours its members seem to exhibit but i see how it can come across like i do,1,423,2704,121,0.05785123966942149
cmv everyone should have easy access to painless death," of my view everyone above age of 18 so that they are capable of making their own decisions irrespective of whether they are mentally or physically ill should have an easy access to painless suicide probably by inhalation of carbon monoxide we already have the technology to do that so my only proposal is to make its access legal and easy for everyone my view does not advocate promotion of suicide this post is not prosuicide but rather prochoice and antipain in fact i would hope nobody would take the choice given to them however everyone should still have a choice are some of the arguments in favor of my thesis personal liberty everyone should have the right to choose what to do with their lives as long as it does not directly harm others
2 euthanasia is not enough the problem with euthanasia is it covers only sick people and the the government gets to decide who is sick thats not ok i am the sole authority over my life if i decide i would like to die no one should be able to stop me from doing so even if i dont have any problems at all in my life
3 problems currently presently people who have decided to kill themselves have to go through extremely hard time to get it done jumping from building hanging are extremely painful and inefficient methods and has high risks of failure the consequences of failed suicide attempt are harmful to the person and their close ones
4 antipain over prolife pain be it physical or mental is single worst problem of humanity almost all problems on earth boils down to enduring pain we should try to eliminate pain as much as possible even if it involves letting people to die i believe lifes value is determined by the value people assign to themselves and not by government society and certainly not god
5 towards utopia  in an utopia earth should only be populated by those who genuinely wish to be here not and those who do not should have an easy and painless exit me address some of the arguments against my view myself so that you need not repeat it in the comments suicide is not ok or any antisuicide arguments i have addressed this in personal liberty you can feel feel to hold your views but you should not be able to control other peoples views and their personal life choices i dont see a difference between antigay sentiments and antisuicide sentiments both of them are directed against personal choices about which the society or government has no business to choose
2 loved ones suffer because of the decision i think this falls under antisuicide argument in first point yes they are affected but so are they if someone they love turn out to be gay go on a drinking spree hold a view that they dont and what not depending on the persons beliefs if someone they love has taken a personal decision they have no choice but to accept it this should not stop anyone to have the right to do whatever they want with their own body
3 its not your life to end it its your opinion you can feel free to hold it however if others disagree let them
4 depressed people are mentally unstable incapable of taking decisions i agree depression is a mental illness and cannot think as clearly as a normal person however i believe even they are capable of evaluating their own pain if they decide their pain is intolerable they deserve to have a choice to end their lives forcing them to stay in this world and making them to take therapy is inhumane denying the depressed people access to suicide because they cant think clearly is like forbidding a low iq person to manage their own finances because they are not capable of doing it
5 depression can be cured or whatever your problem is it can be solved well their problem may or may not be solved and they might even potentially have a happier life but it is irrelevant if they have decided they have had enough nobody should have a say in it just like nobody should have a say in how someone else should spend their lottery money moreover a potential happy life event a after cure of depression is not necessarily a better outcome than a painless death event b after death there is nothing nothing is just that nothing its not better or worse than event a on the other hand suffering is a worse outcome than a painless death
6 the proposal may lead to death due to rash decisions i agree it can happen it may even lead to a miserable lives for their kids or spouse thats why i think people should take the decisions responsibly which according to me they are capable of doing so i also dont think its easy to commit suicide psychologically despite making it easily available however if it happens we would have to live with it
7 easy access may lead to a suicide epidemic i will not deny the possibility of this happening let me rather address the consequences of the event as i have addressed in point 4 supporting my view i think world is better off if less people endure pain even if it is under the cost of losing many lives while i do not believe it will happen i dont see a problem even if half of the planet decides to press the suicide button or even end of humanity said this i believe we should actively dissuade people from committing suicide and campaign them to live we should also help cure depression as we are already doing now however despite the efforts if they choose to end their lives they should have a choice to do it easily and painlessly",1,978,5633,55,0.07272727272727272
cmv women in the united states should be required to sign up for the draft when they turn 18 as well,"though the draft has been universally unpopular the fact that modern era women should not sign up baffles me if a man were to not sign up for the draft after turning 18 in a timley fashion he will be fined and possibly jailed the idea that women are not subject to the same treatment as men is frankly unequal and sexist previously based on cultural norms and prejudices it would make sense that they were not required now in 2018 with a slew of cultural progression in terms of womens rights gender norms being toppled and society celebrating women in powerful positions why do we not see a change in policy to reflect our cultural progression as a nation im only focusing directly on male and female racereligiontrans peopleetc a is separate issue in this case  thank you for all the wonderful responses and those who have taken the time to really think about this cmv it has come to my attention that some posters are stating a removal of the selective service draft while i do agree with you because the us has the largest volunteer military the lawact exists and the focus is not on repealing the law but instead the equal commitment of men and women 
one large portion with this argument is that men must sign the selective service agreement in order to express their vote while women freely receive this right upon turning 18 this is the main point of the cmv equal commitment for equal expression if one must commit to die to express their votes and freedoms while the other freely receives theirs that is an issue of inequality",1,278,1575,102,0.058823529411764705
cmv as a black feminist i hate the women are scared when they see a man walking towards them at night talking point,ive been curious about this for a little while to be clear i am a feminist i agree with just about all of the societal critiques that intersectional and third wave feminists use so im absolutely not coming at this from an antifeminist perspective  ive seen this talking used quite a bit on the discussion of privilege basically that a lot of women have this fear when theyre walking alone usually at night they see a man and they get scared because this man could potentially be a threat i 100 understand and empathize with this  this causes a bit of an internal struggle for me im black and ive experienced the whole person moves away from you because they think youre violent thing and it feels really shitty and in society today someone would not get away with saying oh yeah if i see a black person and its late at night im instantly fearful for my safety so im not sure why an analogous talking point is acceptable when talking about men be fair i mainly see this talking point in pop feminist and white feminist circles because i do think the more intersectional feminists are aware of how that talking point can be misapplied  im also a feminist so i would prefer if mostly feminists would be willing to talk with me about this but if youre an antifeminist feel free too but i may not agree with most thing you have to say this isnt to call out a hypocrisy i genuinely want to get over this okay i have been getting a deluge of comments that dont seem to be reading what im saying or intentionally misinterpreting what im saying i am not saying that it is wrong or out of bounds for women to cross the street when they see a man i am speaking specifically to how this can be misapplied to racist people and i have already given several deltas that actually engage with this point i also apparently need to clarify i am not saying that you as a woman have racist motivated reasoning for crossing the street the point that im making with regard to race is an entirely separate issue that im merely drawing a parallel too ive been getting a lot of comments with people justifying their right to cross the street and assuring me that they dont care about race when they cross the street that was never my question that was never my point of contention i would chock this up to me being inarticulate but many people seem to have understood the gist of what i was getting at and didnt try to argue with me with that framing any similar replies will be a waste of effort because im not going to respond to them so save your time and mine thank you 2 i removed a particular line that was pointed out by a response that led them to believe i was implying that all women who are scared of me are automatically racist do i think this person was being genuine or course they werent but i still want to keep the conversation good faith and so i am removing that remark from the original post,1,547,3033,120,0.05
cmv trump is the most impeachable president in us history,"by most impeachable i mean hes committed the greatest numerical definitively impeachable actions   i believe the number of offenses that trump has committed since entering office that are so bad he should be impeached is greater than any previous president  hold this view because we have substantial evidence from the mueller report of trumps actions meeting all 3 requirements for a criminal conviction on obstruction of justice for 4 separate incidents addition trump has violated the emoluments clause at least 6 times since he took office hes had a multidecades long relationship with someone whos been revealed to be a childsex trafficker  edit not an impeachable offense now its revealed that hes abused his power in 1 asserting foreign policy for political gain and 2 engaged in a cover up to hide this from the american public my count this adds up to 13  12 incidents each of which are impeachable on their own change my view youd need to show by combination that trump presidency so far has fewer impeachable offenses by arguing that some of the above 13 offenses arent impeachable offenses

cmv alcohol would be illegal if its use began today,"this cmv relates to the drug alcohol and its use mainly in beverages with the aim or consequence of getting the person into a mental and physical state called being drunk 
i have had many conversations where people cannot seem to imagine why alcohol would be considered equal or worse in effects than other commonly used drugs like marijuana and cocaine if we heard news reports today about alcohol users congregating and becoming disinhibited in the behaviour becoming aggressive and sexual in behaviour suddenly collapsing in the road and occassionally oding there would be a scandal and initiatives by governments to stop this evil scourge some people will say a few beers a week will do nothing and dont really change your behaviour but the same is true of the other drugs above in small amounts the only reason it is not banned is due to longterm cultural emedding in everything from weddings to funerals you could say but you cant separate culture from its use but we have done these things with age old traditions which are harmful to society like marital rape and revenge killing cycles",1,188,1119,53,0.07547169811320754
cmv youtube rewind will never be good again,now im not hating on youtube for making a rewind people dont like quite the opposite before this years rewind one of the most common criticisms of rewind was that it doesnt represent the youtube community i think youtube has grown so large as a platform that they cant fit enough familiar faces for the majority of people to recognise in a rewind this leads to most people who watch rewind thinking this doesnt represent youtube i hardly know anyone in this i dont think it is possible for youtube to create a rewind that the majority will feel represent their perception of the youtube community purely due to the number of creators compared to how many creators each of us can watch looking at numbers there are over 2400 channels with more than 1mil subs im not sure how many channels the average user actively engages in but it would be lucky to be even 01 of this number back when youtube rewinds were liked the ratio of youtubers engaged with to total youtubers would have been much higher making it easier for youtube to show the majority of people familiar creators as such the likedislike ratio has been gradually getting worse as the number of creators expands and the concentration of familiar creators in rewind is diluted for viewers i accept it is possible that i am wrong and youtube are capable of making a good rewind perhaps my reasoning as to why they wont be good is flawed and people dont feel like they need to see a lot of their favourite creators in rewind to like the video or even not dislike it i hope i am wrong and it is possible for youtube to make a rewind that the majority like but i really dont think its possible,1,303,1685,46,0.10869565217391304
cmv serena williams sexism claims after losing the us open are not only false but also dangerous,as probably all of you know serena williams lost the us open final to naomi osaka a 20 yearold tennis player from japan who won her first grand slam but what made it to the headlines was the outburst that the northamerican had after being penalized by the umpire carlos ramos in my opinion she was correctly admonished by the portuguese umpire who just limited himself to follow the rules to set some common ground carlos ramos barely misses anything from the matches he umpires so it is likely that he catches any coaching coming from any coach it is also known that ramos is known for being relatively strict in what comes to umpiring having given several violations to the most famous tennis players such as nadal djokovic murray and of course kyrgios and knowing serenas temper it would be predictable that had she gotten even the slightest heated up she would get at least a warning since she screamed at him calling him a liar and a thief and using the fact that shes a mother as an excuse which im still trying to figure out hows that an excuse i guess the outcome is far from surprising as for the racket being smashed theres really not much to say its a clear violation so even though it is arguable that he could have skipped some of his warnings the fact is that violations were committed and rightfully reprehended resulting in a one game penalty what i want to discuss here is the fact that williams turned this into a sex discrimination issue i think she has only done this because she wanted to find a way to justify the fact that she was visibly inferior to her opponent who undoubtedly deserved to win and also definitely deserved more praise following her incredible victory secondly i also think that she is better than all of this and that she was only caught in the heat of the final think it is a true shame that serena williams accuses carlos ramos of sexism acts of discriminating nature sexism racism xenophobia etc are unquestionably wrong and must be censured to its core as far as possible they bring dishonor and disgust to our society which also means that we should be particularly cautious in what comes to identifying this matters well this is exactly the opposite of what the 36 yearsold did she was not careful instead she found an opportunity to unduly play the sex card as a way of making herself look better after throwing a tantrum in front of her own people she had nowhere to turn and she chose the victimization path not only blaming her loss on the wrong decisions made by the umpire but also hiding her failure behind made up chauvinism claims without grounds far as my opinion is concerned this allegation is dangerous because it can bring hatred and more to carlos as well as lower the standards of what is considered sexism opening up a whole new discussion on what is and what is not ethic in what regards gender treatment this way some women may feel that they too can play the sex card for any minor adversity they may have even when completely disconnected with gender thereby the gender balance that all of us especially women are fighting for becomes uneven finish i think this has only got such worldwide dimensions since sexism is such a trending topic nowadays with womens selfassurance fairly getting more and more power and attention and dont get me wrong im all in favor of double standards and equal opportunities but it is important to look at things impartially and to have a critical eye on what is and what is not discrimination or else it may have drastic consequences especially when the main actor has the same influence as serena i think serena made this sexism thing up to find an excuse for her loss and we have to be careful not to call every little thing as sexist or discriminating or else we will all be little snowflakes that get offended with everything also as udontcallmeshirlie stated below theres one more thing to take into account does he penalize other women more harshly then men everyone keeps framing this as serena vs men  sexism if ramos penalizes women in general more harshly then men then yes thats sexism if it was just serena then i think sexism is a baseless accusation ,1,751,4357,98,0.08163265306122448
cmv anybody should be allowed to sing any rap song lyrics including lyrics that may cause controversy across racial groups,i’m not sure if this has been covered on this thread yet but with the recent kendrick lamar issue i feel this should be discussed  me preface real by saying that i am a white male and kendrick lamar is one of my favorite rappers of all time  those who haven’t heard there was recently an incident at a kendrick show in alabama where a white girl was invited on stage to rap maad city alongside lamar she rapped the chorus with includes the nword multiple times as many rap songs do the crowd did not react well and she left the stage shortly after there has been rumor that this was set up although i have not seen solid evidence yet and honestly don’t expect to  my issue  lyrics are part of the song why say them if you don’t want people to repeat them the argument that white people should not be allowed to repeat these lyrics is very weak as white people support the artists by attending the concerts and purchasing the music just the way black people do i understand the history and the cultural aspects of the word if it is going to spark fires then why continuously repeat it a travis scott concert some time back he held the mic out to a white fan who proceeded to rap lines that included the nword and scott allowed it i feel this is because he understands that he made the lyrics and that people fuck with his music and want to sing along not sure if kendrick had the white girl removed from stage because the crowd was booing and he wanted to keep the peace or if he actually believed she should not be repeating his lyrics but i do think it was a little shady of the king to do so  open to all opinions i really want to discuss this because i really like kendrick and don’t want this to change my opinion of him furthermore it is unfair to say white people are not allowed the same rights to rap along to songs as blacks people are cmv  it’s only been an hour and i already have been exposed to some phenomenal explanations i want to thank most of you who have commented thus far for a solid discussion  2 i will be awarding delta later when i’m not on mobile,1,407,2156,125,0.032

cmv restricting the number of new people you can contact each day in an online dating service would make the whole experience of online dating much better for both men and women,so i have this idea of how online dating should work to make it better for everyone i think this idea is amazing but for some reason dating services dont implement anything like that so is there something wrong with the idea that im missing on my own experiences and the common criticism that other people often have with online dating it seems to me that the main problem with the whole experience is too much spam complain that they are flooded with lots of low effort messages many of them perverted that makes the whole experience unpleasant complain that almost all their messages get ignored and they need to send a lot of them before they find someone who will even reply that makes the whole experience unpleasant my idea is to create a limit for example that you could only contact 3 new people per day if youre already chatting with someone you could continue to do so without restrictions since the limit is only about sending messages to people you dont know yet limit should be absolute with no way to extend it for example by paying for a premium account if someone tries to circumvent it by creating new accounts all of their accounts should get banned way women wouldnt be flooded with low quality spam and men wouldnt have to send so many messages to compete with spammers they could write just a few but high effort messages and have a much bigger chance that someone will read and reply to it is there anything im missing that could make it a bad idea,1,269,1550,178,0.02247191011235955

4 some gatherings dont operate on an invite system  theyre planned informally or in a group chat if a person isnt in the group chat or informal discussion setting theres a reason why if that reason is because the person isnt on a certain platform thats on them unless someone in the group suggests they reach out to those who arent in the chat and if people not in the chat are being reached out to theres a reason this person isnt one of them people who dont get invited to gatherings with their friends should seek out people who truly accept them and want them around",1,228,1305,136,0.03676470588235294

this isn’t about free expression this is about paying for reach and paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today’s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle it’s worth stepping back in order to address view is as the title suggests that this is the correct action and should be followed by other social media  its worth noting that this policy will affect every side making gop outrage that its yet another attempt by the left to silence trump and conservatives brad parscale manager of president donald trumps reelection campaign quoted in article linked above  its exactly this balance rather than efforts to censormoderatefact check said advertisements that makes me think its correct know that reddit leaning left will probably generally agree with me on this  heaven knows most dems do  however i wanted to provide others with a chance to share their perspectives  its possible im wrong about something and im more than willing to hear it i put this in a reply somewhere in the thread and i think it will help focus the discussion a bit more for why it should be banned the simple reason is that we dont really understand how farreaching the effect is on voting habits or political activity  while its not the point of this cmv so not a conversation i want to get bogged in id argue that trumps success even before getting elected further encouraged the altright who were already beginning to view the depth of their echo chamber as indicative of how widespread and legitimate their beliefs were  now youre giving politicians the ability to pay to reach people they normally wouldnt have  that seems polarizing to me  exacerbating the lack of political discourse and due diligence in voting in favor of what others have paid to show you dont know if any of that made sense though  its a very murky topic and kind of the reason im doing a cmv  theres probably an aspect of all of this that im missing and if so its likely there man rip my inbox  sorry i havent been able to address your thoughts very thoroughly its been a long day of engaging with relatively new ideas  this has been a great experience though for the most part everyones been polite and thoughtful  ill keep responding as im able but im hopping off for now  thank you all",1,464,2736,72,0.05555555555555555

cmv if you’ve criticized colin kaepernik then it’s safe to say you would’ve done the same with mlk,i know this isn’t scientifically measurable i think but i still think there’s merit to it  find the criticisms of ck to be often times based on him “not knowing whenwhere” to protest the same arguments made about mlk i know some people have argued he’s just not good enough to play in the league but there’s ample evidence that this simply isn’t true  also have seen a few of those that do criticize ck invoke mlk as an example of “how you’re supposed to protest” while ignoring the historic criticism that mlk faced for the same “reason” to explain and answer all questions i’m not great at coherence i should specify that i mean people criticizing ck for protesting not for suing the nfl i figured the context made that clear,1,134,767,100,0.09

cmv the west including my country denmark should sanction saudi arabia for numerous reasons or at least stop supporting saudi arabia and actually oppose it,"view has been changed


 reason for that is many of the human rights abuses in saudi arabia for smaller crimes secular liberal people being punished and such the attacks on yemen at the expense of yemeni citizens and not just opposition i believe a lot of citizen death could be avoided and dealt with without bombing the country  well as the spread of wahhabism or saladism which many other muslims dislike but saudi sponsors mosques

 “the fact that i’m seen as a terrorist by them since i’m an atheist”  was in the uae this winter and saw that mainly saudi women were following behind the saudi men like dogs i could see who was saudi’s by they’re attires just don’t understand why many western countries seems to support the country when many of the citizens online seem opposed to the country might just be usa supporting the saudi’s but i’m uninformed in that regard i’m a pretty open minded guy who’s interested in listening so my views are pretty easy to change so go for it  and i would get to handing out some deltas about misspellings if there’s a lot of them i’m not good behind a keyboard

cmv fawning over royalty is outdated,"i may have mistitled this post but what i’m trying to understand is why a large amount of people my girlfriend included are interested in the royal wedding and are putting stock into it  girlfriend is currently watching the live stream of it and all they are broadcasting is a panel of people discussing celebrities and describing the wedding as if they’ve never seen or heard of two people getting married before my understanding that those in the royal family are they are just average people like anyone else they simply have power and are such perceived to be ‘better’ somehow by the public  that why they have this spotlight on them is it that in 2018 we are focusing on such trivial events with such a magnifying glass can’t be the only person that’s thinking this please help me understand
  now understand that there were many different reasons to tune in to the wedding and there were also a variety of reasons it was televised  now more interested in why humanity has such a focus on escapism is it something we will pass onto our youth or will we curtail it and learn to live on the moment with our friends and families

cmv reddit usernames that contain racial slurs should be banned,"warning i use racial slurs in the explanation of my argument black and the use of nigger on reddit makes me uncomfortable for obvious reasons hard r is objectively a racist term and is only used to make black people feel attackedunsafeunwelcome but im also uncomfortable with how popular use of the word nigga has become among what is a primarily white user base people dont necessarily use it in ways to make black people feel bad but they often use it for shock value to troll or because they think its edgyfunforbidden to me it really ignores the history of the term and is super disrespectful to black people on reddit that have said they find it offensive im sure a lot of people have a black friend that has given them the nigga pass but  if you ask that black friend  they would definitely tell you that the nigga pass is not transferrable just because you got it from one person doesnt mean you have it from all black people it is entirely fair for some black people to be offended by nonblack people saying nigga and for some others not to care this isnt a cmv about that if you want to hear my basic viewpoint on the matter check out this video by tanehisi coates again its not the focus of the cmv there was a great comment made on raita a little bit ago on a superficially unrelated thread that i think is just so pithy and useful for describing my feeling on how we should speak to each other online is this important to me i have never not once been able to identify myself as black on reddit without getting a deluge of private messages calling me a nigger not a nigga  a nigger telling me to shut the fuck up nigger nigger nigger nigger so on and so on reddit is on the whole a pretty cool place but it is not always welcoming to people of color since its not a place where people of color can always feel welcome since its a place where some amount of people not everyone obviously go out of their way to harass black people simply for being black on the internet it makes me uncomfortable that so many people are just throwing around the term on here like it doesnt mean anything one of the reasons why i have no emotional reaction to black people using nigga is because i know they dont hate me because of the color of my skin they dont think im dumb or violent because of my skin they dont think that i deserve less because im black i dont know that with people on reddit and every time i see nigga in a username or a comment is a small reminder of that of the fact that  if i mentioned this one small detail about my identity  id get a bunch of threatening harassing messages on a place that should be fun for me to hang out and look at dumb shit has started making an effort to curb the use of nigga on the site in ways that dont feature any overt racial animus rwaterniggas comes to mind i believe this should extend to usernames if theres a way to allow affected users to change their names instead of deleting their accounts that would obviously be preferable but if thats not possible i think the accounts should be deleted again i dont necessarily think that everyone with nigga in their username is a bad person but that word affects a lot of people in a pretty negative way and we should respect the history and power of that word you may have an argument to make about the changing nature of that word id disagree but theres an argument but to return to the comment i shouted out earlier theres a difference between being right and being a nice person not being able to use the word nigga in a username should not negatively impact the reddit experience for anyone and it would positively affect the experiences of quite a few for reading and responding i hope we can keep it civil and productive ive got to say that at this point this is the first time ive idd myself as black on reddit and havent been hit with a bunch of racist messages as of 1129pm eastern on 723 i dont know if thats because people on cmv are cool or if its because this isnt a super popular post or both but its cool nonetheless that being said ive got to get some sleep but ill hop back on tomorrow i will say though that a lot of the argument has been about whether or not nigga is offensive and not about the point i made that reddit has started quarantiningbanning subs with nigga in the title and they should similarly ban account with nigga or other slurs in the name i hope im not coming off as not being able to change my mind im trying to be as open as possible 2 okay i know i said i was logging off an hour ago but i came back on to respond to a couple more people now im logging off if you can please avoid making more what about this word arguments for starters its already been made like twenty times in the comments below but on top of that i dont know if they really address the issue at hand im enjoying the chat though i hope you find it interesting too 3 holy crap this blew up overnight for starters we can nix that whole cool i didnt get any racist harassment thing i got less than usual but a couple of classy fellas felt the need to remind me that im a nigger overnight second im definitely not going to be able to respond to everyone but ill try to hang out for a bit and see if there are any deltas to give out im starting with the bottom since toplevel comments have already gotten quite a lot of attention edit thanks to all of you that replied this seems like its starting to snowball and im getting 10 notifications every time i refresh theres no way for me to keep up with everyone but ill post a quick rundown here there have been a lot of what if hypothetical responses that have strayed away from the main point reddit doesnt allow these words in the titles of subs and that should extend to usernames too 
 weve talked a lot about the slippery slope which is not inherently fallacious but i believe that it has been used in a fallacious way pretty frequently a lot of the logical consequences of banning niggernigga in usernames that are being discussed are actually not all that logical nor do they address the point of this cmv im not talking about the legitimate gripe that some people have with the word eskimo thats a different discussion
 i gave a delta that was removed for some reason to uscottcmus comment saying that though i find it problematic i think the suggestion that reddit create a feature that automatically hides usernames featuring slurs that individuals find offensive is a viable solution that is different from my original proposal try to keep commenting throughout the day but its pretty overwhelming at this point again thanks to all of you for for the most part engaging with this cmv in a productive way and if youre someone who insisted on taking time out of your daynight to message me calling me a nigger or to tell me in the comments to stfu you dumb nigger  i dont know think about your life decisions",1,1313,7647,65,0.06153846153846154
cmv if abortion is a sin then being soldier willingly while invading another country should also be considered a sin,"some people believe that abortion is a sin but it  is ok to be a soldier and invade other countries but i disagree for the following reasons  abortion is sin because it is wrong to intentionally harm or take the life of another human being a soldier who invades another country is no different because in that case a soldier is paid to intentionally kill other people nearly all legal abortions happen when a fetus is attached by the placenta and umbilical cord to the mother and at a time when it has no  the nervous system with the capacity to receive pain or to have feelings so it wont feel any pain the people who might killed by the soldiers  are going to feel intense pain and they are going to suffer both physical and emotionally as they are watching other people die they may suffer from ptsd even if they survive the people who might killed by the soldier may have families friends wives husbands and people who care about them  but   the fetus hasnt form real relationships yet its mother may love it but they havent form an actual relationship but even so it is her choice anyway so this isnt going to hurt her and she consider it the most painful choice someone may claim that soldiers may go to invade  or to fight in another country because this is beneficial for their country but abortion is also beneficial because it prevents kids from growing up in bad conditions or parents who arent ready or mature to have kids therefore the country will have better individuals in the future i am not saying that these things are bad i am just saying if the abortion is wrong then being a soldier who invades another country is also wrong but i believe that both are ok in some cases
 thank you for all your comments you helped me to expand my view and to understand that sometimes it might be necessary to fight a specific group of people by invading their country if for example they are nazis or jihadists and therefore you do it to protect the lifes of innocent peoplealthough sometimes they also kill innocent people like kids or they lie about their motives   but thats a conversation for another time",1,396,2194,118,0.03389830508474576

cmv if you believe that transgender women have an advantage over xx women in competitive sports it is not transphobic to suggest they be excluded,"hi this is in regards to the controversy surrounding a youtuber named rationality rules here is the video that stirred the controversy and here is a video that i believe does an excellent job at explaining the problems with it i dont think watching these videos are required to change my view but if you want to understand where i am coming from  here it is off i have the following opinions the rights of transgender women should be the same as women
 therefore the default for transgender women in womens sports should be inclusion
 in competitive sports fairness is important above all and this is the justification behind the banning of steroids for example
  based on the arguments in the original essence of thought video i believe the only valid evidence is to compare transgender women on hormone replacement therapyhrt to xx women and that constitutes the basis for rationality rules videowhere he uses studies comparing xx biology to xy biology being incorrect pending better evidence
 it is not okay that rationality rules had a quote in his original video that called a transgender women a man that is not okay rules video has been called transphobic because it calls a transgender woman a man i will grant this complaint is that he dehumanizes two transgender female athletes by suggesting their success in running placing in the top 8 above another runner is due to their xy biology and suggesting a xx runner who placed outside of the top 8 lost her dreams because of this my understanding of the dehumanization argument here is that the xy female runners have dreams too and making it seem like they are bad and that their success is a bad thingnot due to fair play is dehumanizing i think this is a fair criticism that i would not like to deal with at length complaint i would like to focus on is that rationality rules is arguing to strip transgender women of their rights in effect i am buying that rr actually believes that transgender women have an advantagedespite being wrong i think in this case fairness in sport trumps fairness in human rights reason i would like my view changed is that it rrs video has been called transphobic and those who support the video or do not see it as fully transphobic are considered not to be allies of lgbtq for example i would like to be an ally and it appears that my general support of rr is at odds with this andor my opinion that if you believe xy women have a competitive advantage in sports compared to xx women then it is not transphobic to argue for their exclusion or restriction edit the cmv has been changed to be more clear about my intention it is now you believe evidence shows that transgender women ahve an advantage over xx women in competitive sports it is not transphobic to suggest they be excluded
 final edit view has been changed basically i now believe you can be unintentionally or ignorantly transphobic  having evidence to back you up isnt enough if you are wrong the way i was led to this conclusion was by considering matters of racism  you can have evidence to back up racist opinions just fine but they are still racist is a link to the conclusion of the comment thread that changed my view if you would like the read i think the commenter is very persuasive",1,585,3728,148,0.04054054054054054
cmv the lack of conservative outcry towards donald trump will ultimately severely undermine future legitimate conservative candidates,i believe and know many conservative individuals representatives and officials who privately strongly disagree with the current administration however their inability to speak out against the administration which as far as i can tell does not hold conservative values speaks to their desire for holding office and holding partisanship over doing what is best for the country i believe this is mostly done for political reasons despite the administration contradicting many of the traditional conservative values such as responsibe fiscal management free trade strength against us adversaries ethical treatment of others acting in a professional manner this has ultimately undermined the sincerity and legitimacy of their arguments and will make them unelectable by sincere conservative voters in the future further the conservative brand has become so heavily tarnished that it will become near impossible in the near future to have a legitimate conservative leader who is not saddled with the legacy of this administration,1,154,1037,135,0.044444444444444446

cmv americans should stop using the term hero to describe those who enlist in the military,as an american i find it common that the phrase hero is something used a lot to describe those who enlist in the military i find that although there are definitely some troops who do heroic things we should not simply throw the term hero around as some sort of umbrella term for those who enlist there are some circumstances in which a soldier does something heroic and worthy of praise i would say throwing yourself on a grenade to protect the others around you is definitely worthy of the term however there are many who enlist that never see a day of physical combat in their lives to use the term hero to describe all people who serve is detracting from the accomplishments of those who really deserve it using a word with such a powerful positive connotation for all those of a particular profession is a bad idea because although its not fun to think about some troops are just bad people enlisting doesnt give you a clean slate and a pure soul just like every other profession those who are in the military are capable of doing both bad and good things for example there have been many cases of sexual assault within the institution to sayact as if those who serve are immediately heroic individuals is to erase the crimes committed by these individuals as well as the experiences of the victims assuming someone who has enlisted is worthy of such a title is toxic as it perpetuates the idea that these individuals are somehow above the normal citizen and that they are incapable of making mistakes andor immoral decisions it makes it seem at though someone who has served is more than what they are a human being capable of both right and wrong,1,299,1722,94,0.0425531914893617
cmv there is no defending the last jedis plot and writing,"let me start off by saying the last jedi tlj has some redeemable aspects the cgi was completely top class and the visual effects were incredible also some of the action was good and the humor was at times good first issue i will raise is involving the light speed maneuver this forever changes the star wars space battles as it completely disregards previously established lore that light speed is in another dimension in which you travel faster from now on every space battle in a star wars movie people will be expecting either faction in the conflict to employ this strategy this scene also disregards every previous space battle in the sagas history as this surely would have been used before if not only as a kamikaze attempt in the next movie the creative team will probably have to create some contrived hypershield to stop this from happening again this is a perfect example of style of substance edit i now have been informed that large structures have a ‘shadow mass’ in hyperspace the main problem presented in this point should now be about how this has never been used before addition half the plot is completely contrived from the moment laura derns character comes in and is secretive to poe who is known to be completely loyal but also hotheaded and prone to solving problems himself it causes half the plot to happen there is no reason for derns character to do this and considering half the resistances leadership just died he may be one of the most appropriate people to tell half the point of this is probably to kickstart finn and roses adventure to space vegas which was a whole completely useless subplot rian jhonson and the creative team completely disregarded the previous film in order to have the protagonists be underdogs there is no reason for the republic funded resistance to having this little of a fleet this is partially the fault of the force awakens for a lack of initial worldbuilding but there is no reason for the previously victorious rebels to be down to 9 useless bombers a few xwings 1 cruiser and 3 medical friggets given this takes place immediately after the events of tfa there is no way a comic or tv show explains this space vegas portion of the film is completely cringeworthy the obvious anticapitalism theme is ironic considering that this trilogy seems to more and more be looking like and unplanned cashgrab from the corporate enterprise that is disney this entire scene could have been cut for more worldbuilding if maz was available to be the master codebreaker and was not just in the film for 30 seconds to meet a diversity quota movie completely destroys lukes character the man who converted the evilest man ever to the light side was always hopeful and optimistic would not try and kill his sister and best friends child who was just a boy he is shown as a grumpy miserable old fart the sadness on mark hamills face during interviews regarding this film is telling my favorite part of the movie is when luke walks out of the rebel base alone and faces the army of atats alone but this is ruined by him making a brushing the shoulders gesture which is completely out of character for him is also a complete mary sue her power would be understandable if she was the daughter of someone relevant like maybe palpatine kenobi or maybe even luke but she is nothing she faces no challenges and has no relatable character flaws unless being bored with being too strong is one she pilots the falcon better than han she is the strongest force user ever luke even says so and can beat kylo in a duel first order is also portrayed as incompetent and amateur in this film in particular general hux their actions in the space chase make no sense general hux who was previously intimidating and one of the few snew trilogy characters i like is played for slapstick and laughs kylo goes from being menacing to an angsty teenager in minutes if the reason for half your plot is the antagonists are incompetent or dumb your movie is badly written final issue ill raise in this main body of the text is how the film had about 0 original ideas yes there were one or two vaguely new ones but its undeniable that a lot of this film was cut and pasted from episode 5 and 6 the new trilogy is obviously trying to show they were more like the originals will also clarify that at points the film was enjoyable somewhat but that doesnt mean it is any better so if someone could explain these major fundamental flaws in this movie then i could change my view so far people have just said well i enjoyed it which seems to be based upon all the fan service wow this really blew up i will work towards getting to all of your comments later today and tomorrow thank you all for contributing

cmv tipping leads to worse service,"im from an european country but have also lived in us for a few years im not going to argue whether tips make sense as a practice or economically just how they effect the quality of service  is commonly believed that us waitstaff goes out of their way because of the incentive that is the tips but here i will argue that this actually only makes things worse for the customer here is what tipping leads to
 overbearing service from fake cheerfulness to constantly having them at your table its just way too much realistically there just isnt that much that a regular waiter can do aside from taking your orders and as long as they are polite and not slow the service is good if you try going above and beyond you actually end up harassing customers in europe the staff leaves the table alone until called  rushing the guests  another negative side effect of having staff constantly at your table is that your pace is dictated by staff who want to clear the table for the next tipping customer i on the other hand enjoy the relaxed atmosphere of european restaurants where you can take all the time in the world to uninterruptedtly talk and enjoy your drinks or meal at any pace  lack of sincerity  among the customers are introverts who like to be left alone and extroverts who like to chitchat and connect with the waiter neither profits from fakemoneybased friendliness of an us waiter you dont actually know if they like you as a person and you suspect no one is that enthusiastic to serve you in europe wait staff isnt over the top and treats you like person to person but when you instigate small talk and get along you know its genuine
 putting value on the customer  for a system that prides itself with great service i find us waitstaff quite rude and exploitative if youre a customer who doesnt intend to spend too much in europe you can gather some coins walk to a pub or a coffee shop ask for the cheapest something and then sit over it for as long as youd like in us this is considered wasting your waiters time and it wasnt until i learned about the mentality later that i could explain why i got such weird reception after saying this i also find it rude that if the client can tip only within the lower end of norm they are also considered or treated as assholes and many americans think these people should not go out at all at least in europe you never meet this sentiment and you can be a cheap customer without any negativity the main reason why us staff hates cheap customers is also that cheap food means low tip even if you calculate the good percentage its sad that poor people are seen as wasting time and space if they want to go out by same servers who expect customers to care about their financial situation 
 all these reasons i think service is better when it doesnt directly financially depend on each individual customer but when servers can instead just focus on doing their job if the service is really bad which can happen in both systems customers can still complain to the management or not come back at all providing good service is still part of a job description and like any other profession being bad at your work can still get you fired put you in a bad spot with your boss customer experience is better when they arent seen as a dollar sign",1,613,3362,35,0.08571428571428572

cmv you can refuse to accept someones identity and still treat them with respect and believe they should have human rights,so big mistake rather than accept i meant believe meaning you can refuse to believe someones identity and still treat them with respect and believe they should have human rights because accept implies coming to terms with someonesomething and if you cant come to terms with someones identity then you probably cant respect them things first i believe transgenderism and non binary is a thing and believe being born in the wrong body is a real issue and transitioning is so far anyway the best method for fixing it just felt like it was unfortunately important to make my position on this clear when it really shouldnt be imo especially in this subreddit been getting a sentiment for a while where if you dont accept someones self identity you simply do not respect or feel they deserve basic human rights to say its mostly from leftist andor lgbt community but might have other people too i think have been getting it from when ever left or lgbt says transgender people are being denied their human rights they almost always point to someone who believes there are 2 genders or transgenderism doesnt exist and somehow that means people who identify as non binary or are transgender they are literally not human and dont deserve respect or human rights for starters i dont thing being accepted as what you identify as is a human right its only a violation of human rights when humans rights as we know are being violated in other words you identifying as say some animal and other people not accepting that identity isnt a violation of rights its only when people start treating you with the same contempt as an animal brings me to the respect part i also believe that you can treat someone with full respect as everyone else but still not be on board with what they identify with because i honestly dont see why not ̶i̶f̶ ̶s̶o̶m̶e̶o̶n̶e̶ ̶t̶o̶l̶d̶ ̶i̶m̶ ̶a̶

wrong pronouns on a person after being told to use the correct pronouns is not disrespectful however i believe it is again let me stress this enough deliberately using hehim on someone who politely asked to be called with sheher is disrespectful why because its not your business to try anything other than basic respect for a random person sure if she was someone closed to you might strike up a conversation about it but if its some random person all you can really do is remember the pronouns that heshe wanted to be addressed by now if you cant remember thats fine but atleast you are trying and thats respectful the main point is to just get by the daily lives of you and that person and anything that gets in the way is just no good for either person someone who thinks hes a alien and hes not and goes to a therapist for help how is the therapist is going to helpaddress that persons problems will he straight up say it to his face hes not a alien or will he say he is what he is and leave it at that no hes going to respectfully say you are a good and sane person which he is with the exception of identifying with a alien but you are just mistaken on your identity and ask him how he got there in identifying as a alien if a therapist can be respectful with someone who identifies with something they are not why cant your average joe thats what i wanna know obligatory holy shet this blew up overnight i would try to reply to as many comments as i can but im afraid i will not be able to reply to everyone out of the 800 comments now that is out of the way clear up some misconceptions and answer some of the most asked questions disrespectful to indulge in someones delusion what is the alternative in trying to be respectful tell them straight they are not what they perceive themselves as or strike up a conversation about it right then and there regardless of the time or the place or theres something else im not getting disrespectful to not believe in someones identity what are you supposed to do to respect them genuinely believe them right then and there from deep within or like the above halt everything you are doing and discuss it with them or use your own time to research it and change your mind on it just to respect them if thats the case then frankly thats asking for a bit too much for basic respect imho but feel free to cmv even on this im not very good when it comes to making up post so maybe there are some grammer issues here and there and some points left out so just bear with me 1  even thought it may not look like it i had the assumption that respect is a conscious effort meaning you can always respect someone as long as you want however that is not the case because you can unintentionally disrespect someone as well however i dont think that is too big of a change because you are bound to disrespect someone one way or the other regardless of what you do 2 given to the person who made me realize i been using accept the wrong way 3 i believed how you came to think of a certain group has no bearing on you respecting them whatsoever but someone made me realize if you believed something negative about a certain group just by reading only a few articles instead of being a little skeptical it would mean you didnt hold them to much respect because we tend to not regard the feelings or rights of people we are quick to judge i think edit phew lots of good points across the board but i think my view and the way ive presented was both a mess because first i think i been conflating everyday respect with genuine respect for a person and the way ive presented also gave people the idea that i believe refusing to accept  that is  refusing to come to terms with a person is somehow respectful so i think ill call it quits now this is only my 2nd reddit thread anyway out of the years of lurking around so i was prepared for a bit of mess but maybe this topic just got out of my hand,1,1154,6634,124,0.024193548387096774
cmv those born in poor economic backgrounds or in bad circumstances shouldnt be expected to act better than everyone else and pull themselves by their bootstraps,with the increasing amount of republican action because of president trump a lot of programs that serve to help the lower class are in danger additonally many from higher classes have opposed to help those in the lower class state that they should pull themselves from their bootstraps when its a fuck ton harder to do just that  many born in worst circumstances do worse overall in life whether academically socially or emotionally goverment assitance should not be eliminated for these people furthermore they shouldnt be looked down upon socially a lot of people in the poor class face more barriers than those in the upper class for instance they shouldnt be shamed for not being able to reach a highcaliber job when they are struggling to be able to sustain themselves in the first place many in the upper or middle class dont have that isssue and obtaining a job like that isnt nearly impossible i apologize in advance for my vague post i didnt think this would gain so much attention and trigger so much people anecdotes arent real evidence first off one of my points is that the negative stigma surrounding poor people is not only unjust but its also not true in the us its seen as their fault that they continue to be poor when thats simply not the case many who are poor were born poor to begin with and its not fair to make them work more than one dead end job to pay basic necessities telling them its their fault when most jobs they have access to dont pay a living wage its not as simple as get a job additonally college degrees are a necessity nowadays and if you were born poor youd have to worry about so many other things than just studying this can affect your overall performance which affects your chances of getting into a good college or staying in the first place overall some people are born with more challenges from the start yes its not impossible to climb out of the poor class but its highly improbable expecting that from everyone in the poor class is just unjust and unrealistic you can only work for so long before it wears you down therefore they should not be expected to act better than everyone else and pull themeslves by their bootstraps,1,395,2262,168,0.023809523809523808
cmv liberal news sources have lost a lot of credibility because of the way they have reported on the muller investigation,for context i am a registered democrat and consider myself a very liberal person i think that trump is a disgrace to the presidency and i think that they way he has deemed all news that speaks badly of him “fake news” is extremely dangerous  it seems to me that cnn msnbc etc have shot themselves in the foot by devoting so much time to the muller investigation over the past two years and by reporting on it as if they were 100 certain that the investigation would lead to clear collusion andor obstruction charges against trump  think that a lot of people including myself felt like these news sources laid out a clear path to a trump impeachment as soon as muller finished his investigation and that trumpfox news would end up making fools of themselves for calling the whole thing a “witch hunt” however it seems like the opposite has happened even when the full report comes out i don’t see how this could be anything except for a huge win for trump  always been skeptical of news sources and attempted to fact check anything i read someone please convince me that fox news isn’t right in saying that i was blinded by my hatred for trump when i believed everyone who was saying this investigation would be a bombshell against trump  woah that’s my first gold thanks stranger  edit this really blew up and it was brought to my attention that people are using this as evidence of liberals becoming protrump or something along those lines so if people are quoting this post please include this i still dont like trump at all regardless of my trust in liberal media i strongly disagree with almost everything trump says does and stands for it is insanely hypocritical to look at this post and say “see fox news was telling the truth the whole time” if you are agreeing with my criticism of cnn and msnbc you should be equally if not more outraged by fox news thanks ,1,345,1948,122,0.040983606557377046
cmv the way reddit handled the recent ban wave was extremely unjust and in bad faith,im not arguing over who should have been banned or whether or not reddit should engage in censorship  thats a separate issue reddit wants to censor fine  but the way they did it was completely unfair  as far as i understand they felt the old set of rules wasnt good enough and decided to update them to better weed out the subreddits they felt didnt fit the spirit of their site andor they wanted to take the site in a different direction if i am way off base about this please let me know  fine again  now if a subreddit was already breaking the old rules but hadnt been caught yet perfectly fair to ban them outright  but many of them i would guess most were in good standing with the old policies and when the policies changed they got immediately banned  thats completely unfair  they had followed the rules reddit made for them and then got banned because reddit decided their own rules werent good enough  its not the subs fault the reddit team didnt come up with a good enough set of rules the first time or decided to update them reddit initially made some rules the subs and their mods followed and enforced them in good faith  then reddit decided they want betternew rules  but if in the past a sub was found to have broken the new rules despite having always faithfully followed the rules they had been given at the time reddit banned the sub without warning  how is that reasonable  again if the sub was found to have violated the old rules no problem ban them  they knew the rules and violated them  perfectly fair  but subs that were in good standing at the time of the rule change should have been given a month or something or whatever time frame is fair to clean themselves up and meet the new policies  if after a month they still werent in good standing then you ban them  but permanently punishing subs in good standing for violating rules that didnt exist yet is insane and tyrannical  to those of you who discussed genuinely thank you  you were the minority and sifting through the you have a view i disagree with ergo you must be an asshole and a trump supporter  asshole is subjective and i dont like trump replies to get to your answers was quite tedious i dont know why trump kept coming up but lot of people here are way too obsessed with him and are clearly not interested in having their views changed or even changing the views of others just pointing out what idiots anyone who has a thought they dont hold are this post had nothing to do with him or any other politicians or really anything that wasnt related to reddits latest bans looks like my initial premise was not accurate and the situation i highlighted was likely exceptional  apparently there were some warnings about the rule changes which were not drastic anyway  plus most banned subs were due to inactivity  i wouldnt go so far as to saying my view was completely changed but good points were brought to my attention and i would agree that the situation was not as poorly handled as i initially thought  maybe reddit could have done a better job about making sure everyone understood what happened as it seems like a lot of people were surprised by the house cleaning but ive never run a giant social media platform so what the hell do i know   to those of you who civilly brought these points to my attention  there are hundreds of comments already so im sorry if i missed some and you didnt get that coveted delta  many of you were wonderingassuming i made this post because some sub of mine got banned  only one that i frequented was banned rbadacademy which was about examples of bad academic practices and from what i understand it got banned for something unrelated to mistreatment of other people i liked the sub so its too bad but it ranks pretty low on my list of priorities and my disappointment lasted maybe half an hour,1,729,3983,86,0.05813953488372093
cmv the biggest motivator of school shootings is that the media gives the perpetrator the attention they want if nobody knew who the shooter was there would be less incentive to commit these acts,i would like to engage with you all and discuss the main motivators of school shootings hear me out as to why i believe this is the main motivator of shooters live in a world where fame is highly sought after we often look up to celebrities and other famous people for all types of life advice andor follow what they do how many people do you know or knew of that being famous was one of their main aspirations in life understand not everybody is the same but most people can attest to the fact that being famous and known is extremely sought after by a lot of folks let me give you an example shot up sandy hook elementary school in point knows the name adam lanza if we didnt publish his name nobody would know who adam lanza was of narcissism can be a highlyinflated self worth disregard of others feelings and wanting to be admired i believe most mass shooters are narcissists my honest opinion this is what drives people to commit these acts its easy fame  can go through your whole life being an outstanding member of society and you will most likely have your name only known in your family you can work hard and be a doctor a lawyer a brilliant engineer but at the end of the day there are millions of others out there that are doctors and lawyers as well in order to be well known you would have to stand out some people strive to achieve fame in their life me out what is easier purchasing a couple of guns and shooting up a school or working your ass off for decades for fame and admiration that may not even come with all the hard work you have put in am by no means trying to invalidate the other problems such as bullying social rejection and mental illness but i believe those issues at most make up half or less than half of the reason that these people commit these violent acts examples in a police interview martin bryant was uncontrollably excited when he saw his name plastered all over the news timothy mcveigh was looking at a list of most evil people in history that was voted on by the public and he was bragging about how he was ranked 21 or something just behind vlad the impaler who in his words idk who that is but his name sounds cool people get off on the rush at the thought that everybody knows who they are and the fact everybody hates them the publishing of the perpetrators names would help curb the majority of heinous acts there would still be people out there that do it regardless but there is a lot less incentive i believe either a new legislate that prohibits the publication of names could help solve one of the biggest problems that face the united states today my view,1,495,2777,200,0.025
cmv having sexual preferences excluding transgender people is not transphobic,arguing that holding sexual preferences specifically excluding transgender people is transphobic is to conflate characteristics one finds sexually valuable with those one deems of holistic value—that is the worth of a human relative to others obviously belief that transgender people have less worth than cisgender people is transphobic doing so would use transstatus as a surrogate for holistic value however sexual preferences—a set of characteristics which indicate sexual value to a person—do not equate holistic value judgements given the distinction between a characteristic indicating sexual value and holistic value to a person sexual preference as it relates to transstatus is not transphobic i am interpreting “transphobic” to mean having or showing the belief that transgender people have lesser holistic value admittedly this definition lacks nuance,1,125,882,78,0.05128205128205128

cmv reddit should hide the scores of posts until the user has voted for themselves,"theres no denying this site has a problem with hivemind mentality the voting system naturally censors unpopular viewpoints but i believe seeing the current score before voting for yourself compromises the integrity of the individual vote leading to more of a band wagon response waiting to reveal the current score until after the individual user has cast his would also prompt users to vote more often this is good because those votes would naturally push the content in a direction that the users appreciate
to reiterate and for easy rebuttal
1 the votes would become more honest
2 the votes would become more frequent

cmv donald trumps blatant use of his position to promote the businesses of himself and his familypunish those that go against is unethical and should be an impeachable offense,"in the wake of trumps tweets retweeted by the official potus account attacking nordstrom for removing ivankas line i am fearful of what appears to be the start of something like neopotism in the highest office of the us advertisingattacking certain companies equates to choosing who succeedsfails look at stock prices after he calls these companies out and the trump families blatant refusal to divest themselves truly from their business amounts to unprecedented conflicts of interest worse it is almost certain that nothing will be done about this by the republican controlled congress who seem content to let trump be trump as long as he allows them the chance to advance their party platform it is my opinion that this should be an impeachable offense as it first of all shows that his interest in the presidency is significantly guided by trump business ventures and further begins a worrying trend of putting companies at risk for going against him other companies could choose not to drop trump businesses now for fear of retaliation we also have the ll bean twitter advertisement by trump to look at as an example of him rewarding donors and supporters  yeah change my view

cmv salaries should be an open discussion in workplaces,often employers discourage or straight up forbid employees from discussing salaries and wages ive worked at places that threaten termination if is discussed im not sure about the legality of not allowing employees to discuss salaries but i do know that is generally frowned upon even though most people are at a job to make money the topic of money at that job seems to be taboo personally id be interested in what others make to gauge what i deserve me this seems like a disadvantage to the workers by discussing your salary openly with coworkers you can negotiate your pay competitively when it comes time to discuss an opportunity for a raise i understand why employers discourage this practice but i do not understand why everyone follows this practice i think the norm should consist of open conversations regarding salary conversations i would love to hear from someone who could explain to me why the practice of not discussing your salary with coworkers is beneficial for the employee  so i’m going to respond to everyone but this escalated a bit quicker than i anticipated i appreciate all the great arguments and points being made though  this is a footnote from the cmv moderators wed like to remind you of a couple of things firstly please read through our rules if you see a comment that has broken one it is more effective to report it than downvote it speaking of which downvotes dont change views any questions or concerns feel free to message us happy cmving,1,259,1751,56,0.07142857142857142
cmv antivaxxers should be legally responsible for any harm that directly comes to their child,you hear all the time in rinsanepeoplefacebook about people wanting help caring with their sick child but without vaccines i didnt care until i saw a recent post about a child being heavily disabled unable to talk and having no grey matter in their brain at all this is because the childs parent couldnt tell if it was the mother or father refused vaccines full grown adult has possibly caused permanent damage to an infant and i certainly havent heard any reports of arrests for child abuse depending on severity this could go all the way up to manslaughter and unless there are stories i havent read no repercussions except the loss of a child they didnt deserve and this is still allowed should make vaccines mandatory for certain cases in which the childs life could be in danger and the government should pay for it because these people are killing their child this case with the babies brain being 100 white matter due to no vaccines is just awful the government should pay for life saving vaccines and these vaccines should be mandatory no opting out unless the obvious allergic reaction or other medical problems the child i mention was actually in his condition due to a refusal of a vitamin supplement not a vaccine though i feel the same logic should apply sorry for the mistake,1,228,1349,94,0.0425531914893617
cmv outrage at every perceived injustice provides a smokescreen for greater injustices to sneak through,lets pretend that a morally reprehensible act could be quantified something like calling someone a mean name might be a 5 whereas sustained verbal and physical abuse might clock in at 50 the numbers are arbitrary and im only using them to make my point easier to understand going to use the easy example of trump lets suppose he says or does something that is a 10 the media goes nuts everyone and their mother is talking about it by the following day this continues to happen regularly with numbers ranging from 515 these are all clearcut examples of reprehensible behavior and understandably cause anger he does something thats a 100 the kind of careless decision that harms millions of people the media goes nuts everyone and their mother is talking about it by the following day you see where im going with this previous outrages served as a vaccine now that the population has reacted like this so many times the news story plays out much the same way this true miscarriage of justice has snuck through because we dont have a way of reacting differently were already at a fever pitch and stuck there think the way news covers every negative mishap has made it too difficult to be aware of when something really bad is happening the news feels like a reality show i have no idea who or what to believe at this point actions that would normally end political careers seem to bounce off of trump i stopped following the news a long time ago because i couldnt take it any more doesnt just apply to politics and can just as easily be seen in interpersonal interactions please show me how reacting to every action that is morally wrong with outrage provides good outcomes hopefully this bizarre analogy makes sense,1,305,1783,106,0.03773584905660377
cmv caller id spoofing should be made entirely illegal,"caller id spoofing is the practice of transmitting digital information with a phone call representing a number as the dialing number other than that which is actually the dialing number believe this practice should be made entirely illegal and that either the accurate calling number or else no number must be transmitted is overwhelmingly used by scammers and spammers and is a major technique of fraud  while some users have an interest in spoofing which is more legitimate those interests can generally be accommodated through just blocking caller id displaying no number spoofing is so prevalent in illegal and deceptive activity and because it is inherently deceptive and because the legitimate users of the service have a nondeceptive alternative i believe spoofing should be banned and that the government should promulgate regulations to telecommunications companies banning the practice entirely

cmv it is wrong to mock trump for physical foibles,tonight at a rally trump went on an extended rant about media depictions of his west point speech a week ago in particular focused on his very cautious walk down a ramp from the stage and a moment where he awkwardly drank water using both hands is clear that the incidents and responses to them are very personally bothering to trump  this cmv post in particular is prompted by this tweet i saw attributing trumps rant to ads run by pacs mocking him for it think it is wrong to run such ads or otherwise try to make political hay out of things like this because we should not mock disabilities or impairments which come from aging  if there is something physically wrong with trump such as arthritis that is giving him issues with these tasks that is not a moral failing and is not something anyone should base their vote on   discounting trumps personal feelings it is cruel and demeaning to people with physical disabilities to mock these sort of things plenty of things to attack trump on i mean he said that he ordered there to be fewer covid tests in his speech tonight for fucks sake  i dont think mocking him for having trouble with a glass of water should be one of them,1,222,1284,52,0.09615384615384616
cmv the concept of gender does not serve a useful purpose and gender theory only serves to promote tribalism,i believe that biological sex is the only sexbased characteristic that should be acknowledged by our society my understanding of gender theory is that it is in broad terms the idea that gender and the concept of manhood or womanhood stems from some kind of social inheritance and that the primary differences between the sexes are the result of an individuals upbringing rather than biological factors it to me has always seemed like a ridiculous solution to the very real problem of inequality between the sexes in my opinion a man or woman should be able to act in whatever way they prefer because of their rights as an individual not because they are part of some special class that has a certain set of psychological characteristics inherent to them yet the idea of gender being a social construct has led many people to falsely believe that the only biological difference between the sexes is their genitals the entire reason im here today is because a friend of a friend tried to argue in all seriousness that the only reason men are stronger than women is because society pushes them to workout more and do strength training she absolutely refused to yield on this position even after i pointed out that my single rep max on bench press was higher than the world record for women in my weight class and that the power lifters competing in these competitions would all be training far more often than me more serious ramifications are situations where parents take their personal and highly politicized views on the subject and use it as justification to permanently and drastically alter their childrens development through hormone therapy because they exhibit behavior in line with a certain gender or worse yet trying to influence the outcome of their gender by insisting on said therapy at the ages some of these treatments are occurring i was not responsible enough to pick out what clothes i was going to wear let alone whether or not i should be replacing my hormones in my mind parents who do this are no different than those parents who send their kid off to gay conversion therapy it is cruel and wrong and setting their children up for selfhatred and depression this is a footnote from the cmv moderators wed like to remind you of a couple of things firstly please read through our rules if you see a comment that has broken one it is more effective to report it than downvote it speaking of which downvotes dont change views any questions or concerns feel free to message us happy cmving,1,439,2789,110,0.05454545454545454

cmv even if we assume the life begins at conception the government should not ban abortions,so i know i know there are way to many abortion cmvs here but i am curious about looking at it from a particular viewpoint believe that the only morality consistent position is that life begins at conception not the part of the cmv that i want changed even if we agree on that for the sake of this cmv agree with the position above the government shouldnt ban abortion because the government cannot force someone to sacrifice their body for another even if you are responsible for the other being in the situation they are in an example is if i were to shoot someone and they will die unless i give them my blood  the government cannot force me to give them my blood even though it is my fault they are dying and giving them my blood wouldnt cause any long term effects on me the government cant force me to do it if you remove the fetus and attempt to let it live through the procedure even though it has a 0 of being successful then the government doesnt have the authority to force you to sacrifice your body for fetus note under this world view abortion would be extremely immoral and evil but morality is not the point of this cmv consistent legality is so i got dragged back into work sooner than expected so i didnt get to have as many conversations as i wanted but thankfully this post exploded and there are a lot of awesome conversations happening so thanks for the patience and you all rock,1,265,1458,93,0.043010752688172046
cmv it is not morally wrong to place environmental regulations on industries like agriculture oilgas companies or large factories to ensure a habitable earth for future generations,many people especially in the us say that it is morally wrong or unconstitutional to regulate certain industries like agriculture oil etc in the name of climate change while you could argue that it is technically unconstitutional i dont believe that it is morally wrong to regulate such things  i understand that some regulations eg not allowing truck drivers to use their diesel trucks and forcing them to replace those with more ecofriendly trucksfuel can put people or businesses out of work i believe that the ends justify the means there are many ecofriendly substitutions or different ways these companies can go about their business while a more ecofriendly world can cost more money for large corporations it is worth it to ensure that our current and future generations have a safe habitable earth to live in if anything i believe it is morally wrong to knowingly pollute and worsen the state of our planet and just leave it for future generations to take care of change starts now and certain government regulations can help understand that environmental regulations are very controversial and people have many different opinions on them im open to hearing other sides of the argument so please try and change my view my view hasnt been entirely changed but ive given out a couple of deltas now to people who have made me realize the other side and understand more intimately how private companies and people are directly affected by regulations,1,246,1510,184,0.02717391304347826
cmv praising an ultra free market means valuing the rich’s right to materials over the very lives of the poor,jeff bezos’s recent 400 million dollar yacht purchase got me here comments online are far more in support of it with people giddy and cheering at the wonderful selfmade hundredbillionaires deserved splurges not that i believe it’s because most people are supporters but the supporters are probably more fervent commenters   on the other hand believe we need to do more to cut the wealth gap amazon shouldn’t be paying 0 in taxes rather obviously to me those who support the free market to the point that they praise a 400 million dollar ridiculous personal purchase then are you not saying that you value bezos’ and many others’ right to material than the very lives of poor people who’s basic needs are not even being met if you find that to be an inaccurate conclusion please change my view i really should have posted when i had time to reply and get into it tonight i will have more individual responses frankly i find us of the first world apt to analyze such problems in an intricacy that while valid convolutes the real issue have all of your earnings lost let’s say of no fault of anyone other than mother nature and watch your children become malnourished and sick and then see bezos’s yacht docked before you and tell me that you don’t think we should do more about the wealth gap tell me through a broken and cracked dehydrated voice that upon analysis you think its fine to just let the money end up where it ends up through the free market don’t care how directly responsible bezos is for poverty i simply do not think that anyone should have such obnoxious abundance i cannot stress this enough while others do not have clean water im okay with some luxury comfort leisure of course i do not have an answer to where exactly the line should be drawn and it will never be a perfect line but i know that a 400 million dollar personal purchase is unjustifiable,1,340,1942,111,0.036036036036036036
cmv i prefer better public transportation to self driving cars investments in america,i should clarify i dont mean government subsidized or operated systems exclusively with public transportation as the japanese train system is private and also runs well i mean any vast transportation network designed to ferry many people at a time or infrastructure more friendly to car alternatives such as trains trolleys buses better roads to include bike lanes and sidewalks more pedestrian spaces etc im not saying that we shouldnt invest in self driving technologies we should but i think that it would be more interesting and efficient to have companies work on improving mass transportation options in america im talking about things like better rail networks more bus only lanes and lightheavy rail options within metropolitan areas bike lanes and wider sidewalk space at the expense of car lanes within cities at least i definitely think self driving cars is a technology that will be invaluable in preventing accidents someday but i wish we could also invest in good public transportation infrastructure in the meantime as well that already works well i would love to go on trains crosscountry rather than fly and sacrifice a day or two in addition i dont think self driving cars can solve the traffic or congestion issue as that is not just a matter of efficiency or bad driving habits but also a matter of  space which can be redirected better with more dense public transportation  i do know how to drive and ive driven extensively i still prefer public transport thank you everyone for such a wide and varied response ill try my best to respond to everyone here but i cant promise ill be able to get through it all but you guys have posted some really really interesting stuff and im excited to keep talking to you all this is a footnote from the cmv moderators wed like to remind you of a couple of things firstly please read through our rules if you see a comment that has broken one it is more effective to report it than downvote it speaking of which downvotes dont change views any questions or concerns feel free to message us happy cmving,1,361,2366,86,0.046511627906976744
cmv comedians should be able to joke about anything,sorry about some of the things i reference in this post being quite outdated i first wrote this post several months ago but it got deleted because i posted it on a friday i forgot about it since but i was going through my profile history and i thought id post this one again always quite disappointing to see internet mobs go after a comic for making edgy jokes that is literally their job for decades its been accepted that comedians make politically incorrect jokes so i dont understand why anything should be offlimits the people who buy tickets to see standup comedy are people who enjoy that kind of humor if you are offended by it just dont watch comedians that make those kinds of jokes the age of social media when people are outraged by something their immediate reaction is to complain about it on social media this leads to people who dont seem to even understand what a joke is trying to cancel a comedian for making offensive jokes heres the thing i dont think theres anything inherently harmful about telling an offensive joke as long as a comedian isnt actually trying to convince his audience to do something hateful i dont believe that theres been any harm done making jokes like this in a school or a workplace could be problematic because the people around you may not want to hear that kind of stuff but when a comedian is performing a routine he is surrounded by people who paid money to hear him be funny they signed up for it take the jokes that louis ck most recently got lambasted for he made fun of trans people and school shooting survivors were those jokes in poor taste absolutely but did he say them in an environment where it was expected that he would make jokes like that yes you can argue that those jokes werent even funny i would even be inclined to agree as i think that louis ck generally works best when he isnt trying to be offensive but i still dont think that he should be given shit for those jokes im sure that he doesnt actually hate kids who were in school shootings and im sure that like every other person with something resembling a heart he has lots of sympathy for them but people werent listening to him reading his manifesto they were listening to him doing what comedians do telling jokes think that we get into some very weird territory once we as a society try to all agree on where the lines should be when it comes to comedy thats why i really dont believe there should be one i dont think that entertainers should have to censor themselves on the offchance that somebody who gets offended easily will listen to a recording of them telling offensive jokes let me know why you guys disagree with me lets just keep discussions to the question of should there be a line when it comes to comedy i was only using louis ck as an example because hes one of the more recent cases of a comedian coming under fire for being too offensive so lets not argue about all the shitty things he did and whether he should be doing comedy at all thats a debate for another thread ill stick around a while longer to reply to some more comments but i just wanted to thank everyone who participated in this thread ive had a great time discussing this topic with all of you i kept reading so many excellent arguments on both sides and constantly having my view changed this was my first post in this sub and im definitely looking forward to doing more 2 there are now far too many comments to keep up with im going to bed i might reply to some more in the morning,1,653,3662,52,0.07692307692307693
cmv publicly funded elections along with other anticorruption laws like gerrymandering prevention would basically fix the us government,"probably the one thing everyone in the us can agree on is that our federal government has a lot of problems nobody in politics seems to listen to anyone except their donors if we eliminate lobby fundraising and private donations to politicians we would flush out the corrupt politicians just looking to make money and bring in honest hardworking people fighting for our interests  these laws or maybe a constitutional amendment i’m not an expert would be obviously terrifically difficult but nevertheless i think it’s an appealing goal
 just remembered that states set their own rules for elections which complicates the issue however i hold the same view about making those elections publicly funded 2 ignore the gerrymandering thing i’m more focused on publicly funded elections",1,127,826,140,0.04285714285714286
cmv straight men being jokingly gay with each other is harmlessnot homophobic,"straight guy here but was having a debate with someone who said

 that the way straight guys are jokingly gay with each other is essentially making homosexuality the butt of the joke its making jokes about a demographic who as a straight male you cant understand their strugglesissues and by making these jokes youre implying to each other that its okay to make fun of gay people or that we are essentially finding homosexuality itself funny  being idk how me and my mates if were planning a holiday might say in our group chat cant wait to share a bed with you xoxo or if planning to hang out with just me and a buddy might say sth along the lines of looking forward to our intimate date night xoxo or name our group chat of all straight men men lovers only are just examples from my own experience but you see this type of straight guys jokingly being gay with each other a lot now i see it as the opposite

 its a way that we i guess express a greater level of closenessaffection towards each other where traditionally the toxic masculinity says men cant be affectionate with each other i see it as straight men embracing homosexuality making themselves more comfortable with it it isnt like the jokes are  a gay man walks into a bar we are the butts of the joke in this sense it isnt making fun of other gay men or homosexuality in general made the argument that just because i make racist jokes doesnt meant im going to discriminate have anything against someone of a different race but the counter argument to this was the fact that im recognizing those jokes are racist whereas here i refuse to recognise these kind of jokes as homophobic

 at the same time i couldnt pinpoint why i find this jokes i make with my friends funny when i had this debate open to have my view changeddiscussed",1,333,1874,79,0.0379746835443038

cmv gender dysphoria is a mental illness,"if this opinion is offensive then im sorry i dont intend to hurt trans people 
 reason im doing this is because i got downvoted cus someone decided to search through my history and demonize me instead of focusing on the argument the mods banned me and told me i was wrong but didnt say why i was wrong i want to know if i dont understand trans people properly and am spreading rumors or if my opinion is valid and these people just assumed i was a bigot and overreacted if my opinion is wrong then its not coming from spite or bigotry but ignorance thats why i posted on here so i can learn the truth 
 is not a mental illness but gender dysphoria is not all trans people feel the dysphoria either i view it as a mental illness because they feel pain from it its close to body dysphoria like anorexia 
 not against transitioning it is their bodies their choice i will not and refuse to get in the way because i have no idea whats best for them they do im not calling them freaks for choosing to switch and im not saying its the wrong decision to do so either im neutral for people who transition slightly leaning towards protransitioning because it requires a lot of courage and strength to do so if it makes someone happier who am i to get in the way of that 
 a similar mental illness edit mental condition not mental illness to autism or did since its a part of your identity it shouldnt be cured its more of trying to help the pain instead of trying to make the person normal the only reason i believe they should receive therapy is to learn tools to mitigate the dysphoria and to become more comfortable with who they are it isnt a replacement of transitioning and its not mandatory as well those who dont want to do it shouldnt be forced to 
 dysphoria is a mental illness being trans isnt a mental illness and should not be cured
 youre going to comment please tell me if youre trans or cis if youre trans can you tell me if 
 experienced dysphoria and how bad iswas it 
 you transitioned did it help you deal with the dysphoria or is it still there 
 youre cisgendered you can still comment and try to educate me but please tell me that youre cis the reason why i ask you to do this is because i need the perspectives of people who actually experience dysphoria since they know what it actually feels like
 my mind is changed im no longer going to call gender dysphoria a mental illness it doesnt meet all of the criteria of a mental illness and it makes me look like a bigot if i say so",1,483,2641,41,0.0975609756097561
cmv the us spends way too much on the military,here are the basic pillars of my view military spending dwarves other spending items  or “national defense” spending routinely accounts for more than half of the us federal budget—hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money— with little demonstrable material benefit meanwhile other cost centers like education housing transportation science etc rarely crack 4 or 5 of the total budget but do a lot more universal good than the us armed forces when you’re a hammer every problem looks like a nail a large military encourages the us to use it in contexts where diplomacy economic pressure or other tools might be more effective furthermore havingand constantly boasting about the world’s largest military encourages other nations that rely on the us to maintain world peace and order forcing them to continue obscene levels of military spending and become embroiled in decadeslong conflicts see iraq the present state of affairs is just another vehicle for the 1 to grow wealthier at the expense of the everyone else large proportion of us military spending is given to defense contractors—basically the tony starks of the word but before he was iron man think lockheed halliburton and blackwater those contractors are milking a classic concentrated benefitsdiffuse costs scenario to line their pockets with billions of taxpayer dollarsall in service of cool toys blowing shit up and making sure that the rest of the world minds its ps and qs i’m getting tons of people pointing out that my figures refer to discretionary spending in the federal budget which is true and valid i should have pointed out that distinction in the post but nonetheless discretionary spending is all that matters entitlements like medicare and social security benefit everyone once they are old enough and are mandatory spending items the military on the other hand is completely at our discretion and still accounts for half a trillion dollars each year,1,316,2035,47,0.19148936170212766

cmv the employers primary duty is not to necessitate workplace diversity but to employ the most competent people available,"while this is probably applicable to other fields ill be using stem as an example because its far more objective to test for quality and merit in those fields its not in the employers business to have a diverse workplace that burden should be on prospective employees in any stemrelated field should be purely based on merit blindly so even if possible all demographic metadata should be completely obscured in the employment process
if the majority of people that end up employed are whites and asians then so be it
 may sound prejudiced coming from someone whod otherwise consider their self a progressive but heres the thing
science by its very nature is a meritocracy your output will always reflect your skill level and competence in fact its so blindly meritocratic that your ideological affiliation and moral alignment dont matter youre either a skilled engineerdoctorscientist or youre not
 any science and tech based firm company etc the primary duty is to make the best quality of output achievable the only way i can see this happening is if the best people for the job are employed after all science and tech is far more than just regurgitating facts memorised in school old work has to be improved upon and new ideas and research have to be developed the ability to think plus the creative skill the prospective employees have are the most relevant parts of their resume it comes to reattaching that spine building that starship making that data security airtight making game servers run faster etc its your ability to make it happen that is to be considered if you just so happen to be female or a minority then thats great if you happen to be a white man thats also great in the end its the quality of results that matters crappy tech and research is the only sin in this context when it comes to these things other peoples lives and livelihoods are usually at stake with the possibility of structural failure data compromise surgical complication etc even the best scientists engineers doctors and technicians can still make mistakes so what hope does a less qualified person have
 issues with diversity should be addressed at the societal level of education culture etc and not at the employers office
if google etx want diversity in the workplace a thing to do is to funnel money and energy into raising awareness and granting their targets the choice of higher quality education so that they can if they wish attain their own skills and assume the positions they are competent for but when it comes to the actual employment blind meritocracy is to be adhered to
 a side note arent east asians and indians etc minorities in the west anymore i may not be a sociologist but im sure a workplace full of east asians and indians and whathaveyou is still quite diverse
 update
people seem to be getting the wrong idea that my post is some sort of passiveaggressive shade at minorities and women
for those willing to actually listen what i am actually saying is that when it comes to certain highly technical fields especially those in which the quality of the product can mean the difference between people dying and people not dying eg surgical medicine aerospace engineering civil engineering etc yes we acknowledge that some minorities dont have access to the education that would help them do well in these fields but those concerns should be addressed at the social level  poverty the justice system educational system discriminatory practices cultural issues etc and not at the employment level the employer is supposed to be a mere gatekeeper blind all he holds is a sign saying must be this competent to pass if the problems at the societal level are fixed then quality workplace diversity will occur",1,637,3925,126,0.031746031746031744

cmv the term “mansplaining” is inherently sexist,"personally i feel as though this term is sexist and misused  what i understand the nature of using the term follows the assumption that a condescending person is sexist based on the fact that this person is a man is this not inherently sexist that i am not denying any sort of institutional or societal sexism towards women that exists or has existed the very least it is a term based on a stereotype that may or may not apply to a particular man though it is used regardless

 i am very aware i am on the inside looking out and do not know what it is like to be on the outside looking in i am asking this question with the intention of hearing other perspectives so please be my guest and poke holes in what i’ve said because i am looking for a greater understanding of the subject and wanted to ask in a place that i know would not be an echo chamber few of my thoughts summed up the logic behind mansplaining is 
“some men will sometimes speak condescendingly” 
this is comparable to 
“some women will sometimes make decisions based on emotion as opposed to logic” how would you feel as a woman when you make a decision to have your decision called womanciding hey did you hear about janet she isn’t talking to you anymore because you didn’t say hi to her last week i figured janet is always womanciding both men and women are capable of being emotional so why call it womanciding i’m sure you can see my point here both men and women are capable of being condescending but a man doing it to a woman needs a specific term for it think if you break it down the sexism lies in the assumption that a man who is condescending is just an asshole if it’s towards a man and sexist if it is towards a woman why not just use “he is condescending” or “she is condescending” because both sexes are capable of being condescending i feel like if you make a special word for one of them you are being obvious sexist  a comparable example yelled at her”
vs
“she bitched her out” clearly includes a more sexist term for the “she” sentence my whole point is if we say “he yelled at her” we should also be saying “she yelled at her” just like we should be saying “she was condescending” and “he was condescending” instead of was condescending to her”
vs
“he was mansplaining to her” “mansplaining” seems petty and vengeful you don’t know if the man you are speaking to is being condescending simply because he is an asshole this is in effect creating a double standard where the belief is women can freely explain things to men but men cannot freely explain to women under risk of appearing to be a sexist  don’t care for the societalinstitutional argument where the claim is that sexism hurt women in the workplace and society because men had more power in those roles i did not do that i took no part in that and don’t know anyone that has i’m sorry if someone you know was hurt by that happening but i had nothing to do with it and if you can associate me with that kind of sexism because of my gender then you are the sexist one 
 am very open to other perspectives and would love to hear what you have to say

cmv prostitution should be legal,"i believe that prostitution should be legalized specifically in the entirety united states of america with new movement and progressive ideals sweeping through the world many individuals have adopted a mental attitude towards sexual expression following the lines of as long as it doesnt hurt anyone and all parties are consenting then i have no problem with it legalized prostitution would ensure that both parties would always be consensual and thus would fulfill the criteria above

 furthermore legalizing prostitution would allow for more regulation i am envisioning this regulation to consist of licensing to prostitutes which can be revoke if drug use stds etc are detected this would drastically reduce the spread of stds from prostution this is vital as the rates of stis are from 5 to 60 times higher among sex workers than in general populations  legalizing prostitution would also drastically lower sex trafficking as people would much prefer to hire a regulated prostitute who is vetted to be safe than
the opposite

 lastly regulation also means tax which would mean more money for the government i dont have specific numbers but if implemented properly legalizing prostitution could net the government money 1 many have pointed out that my initial claim that legalizing prostitution would also drastically lower sex trafficking is not valid many sources have been thrown around and the only conclusion i draw from so many conflicting sources is that more research is needed into the topic is a reupload as a mod told me to resubmit this thread due to a late approval",1,258,1791,33,0.21212121212121213
cmv if your post is removed from a subreddit there should always be a pm with the reason for removal,"i think that there should always be a pm sent to people who have had posts removed from subreddits telling them that their post was removed and why it was removed this should be automatic and subreddits should have a mandatory reason for removal that must be selected when the post is removed i think this is important so that someone doesnt end up waiting hours for responses that will never come to a deleted post and so that people can actually know when they are violating rules so they can reform i have never moderated a subreddit before so i cannot say for sure that this is correct but i think that this may lead to people reposting their threads more since they think their old threads were simply not posted at the right time and didnt get many responses as opposed to their thread being removed shadowbanning may be a good idea for some users but this should be something involving reddit admins as opposed to subreddits

cmv the idea that taxation is theft is a clear sign of a failure in the educational system,in my travels through the internet ive read plenty of times the argument that taxation is a form of theft on the part of the government i honestly think that this idea springs from a failure on the part of the educational system to explain how democratic societies work can only talk about the education i had so i think its appropiate to point a few details im from argentina where the ministery of education dictates what topics should be adressed during our 6 years of secondary school from years 25 we have a subject called citizen and ethical formation which focuses on teaching human rights forms of discrimination how the constitution and our goverment works etc  one of the big points we are taught when it comes to taxation is that it is necesary for a society to function a country can not rely solely on its industry and exports to mantain a good level of life for its citizens me this idea that taxation is theft shows how little people understand about societies and how they function but there may be a detail im missing like political leaning or personal prejudice i would like to hear specially from any american that thinks this way almost every time i read about this argument it seems to come from our neighbours up north i have to admit i didnt expect this level of engagement and civil discussion being new to reddit i have to say bravo cmv reddit bravo  2 this post blew up i apologize to anyone who has commented and hasnt been properly answered to im out of town at the moment so answering this many comments is impossible i promise ill adress them as soon as i can thank you,1,295,1675,92,0.043478260869565216
cmv the united states of america needs to rely more on their state governments and less on the federal government,"first and for most im going to point out that this view is actually relatively unmotivated by specific politics of course investment is going to come from the government but i want to make it absolutely clear that what im speaking about is beyond just political party a and political party b united states for all intents and purposes were a set of regulated territories that selfgovern under a larger governments guidelines this was put into place so that the states could protect their people and attend to their more specific needs while biggerinternational problems could be handled by the federal government all 50 of our states however have become dependent on the federal government for guidance and the federal government has grown greedy when it comes to its need for the states to rely on it believe this is because the government at some point probably by accident started to become more federally dependent state governments have a duty to their people they exist to fill the niche of the territory it inhabitswhat works in inflationovergrowth california wont work in rustbelt michigan and what works in flyover south dakota isnt gonna work in bigapple new york take marijuana as an example states lately have been legalizing marijuana one of the few times they undermine federal law to pass rules that are specific to their own territories federally banning marijuana never made any sense and in doing so the overarching us government has crippled potentially booming markets because its considered drug trafficking to move cannabis over state lineseven to other legal states also have to accept that culturally the united states is not and will not ever be homogeneous i think when we fail to realize that states will never agree with each other because fundamentally they all have different roots and infrastructure that sets up their foundation thats fine but when you apply sweeping rule changes across the whole country it can isolate states and polarize them because they feel they can claim victimhood for having their opinions stamped out i guess my argument to be surmised as this we give so much power to the federal government we are forgetting that the strength of the united states is that state citizenship is akin to a liquid asset and its one that gives the people the most power if people dont like your state they will leave if they leave your states infrastructure crumbles if the federal government applies sweeping rules to try and fix that problem it could fuckup the equilibrium else where if the states have to rely on people inhabiting their states for power then that by default gives people more of a voice in their government  
 or in other words its time to start treating the states more like the little countries they are and let the federal government focus less on internal affairs",1,481,2937,115,0.06086956521739131
cmv if america had dropped the atomic bomb in a less populated or even unpopulated area of japan then the japanese empire would have surrendered anyway there was no need to kill so many innocent people,witnessing the awesome destructive power of the atomic bomb was what led the japanese to surrender simply seeing its destructive power was surely more than enough hiroshima and nagasaki may have had some value as military targets but they were overwhelmingly filled with innocent people the point of dropping the bombs was to was to demonstrate destructive power levelling a forest or sparsely populated coastal area or even a straight isolated military target would have made for clear evidence that would have led to japans surrender without so many thousands of dead a warning shot if you will in the incredibly unlikely event that they would not surrender america could then have aimed at more strategic targets,1,117,729,207,0.043478260869565216
cmv someone being my family member doesn’t mean i should give them a pass on bad behavior,with the holiday season it’s the time of year where racist uncles and thrice divorced aunts start showing up and the age old argument will be thrown out “i know you don’t like them but they’re family so you need to get along and give them a pass” opinion is that someone being family doesn’t earn them anything if nothing about them was different except for that they weren’t my family would i still have to respect them and like them  i think no i think there need to be more reasons i think family gets a pass too much  never forget the time my brother gave me a black eye and bloody nose but i was the one in trouble for staying mad about it and wanting to file a police report i was rightfully afraid but my parents talked me down “he’s your brother” they said “and we treat family differently you need to give him more chances you two have to get along because that’s what family does”  i’m sad to admit they guilted me into letting him get away with knocking me out with his fists i don’t think i’m the first person or the last who was guilted into giving family members a pass on bad behavior  think if anyone family or not is to get a pass on bad behavior better reasons need to be given i don’t think there’s any legitimate moral obligation to put family on a pedestal and a think doing so is dangerous and unhealthy  view could be changed if i can be convinced that someone being a family member is the only reason there needs to be to let someone get away with behavior you otherwise would call out or do something about for example if someone at the dinner table was overtly racist convince me that i should only call out the racism and comment on it if the person isn’t my family   i’ll define giving a pass giving a pass includes taking no action that could lead the offender to think they’ve offended if someone beats you up giving a pass means you tell them it’s all good and that you’re not mad about it if someone is racist giving a pass means you will agree nod your head stay silent etc so long as the speaker is able to keep thinking nobody has a problem with their comments ,1,410,2165,90,0.044444444444444446
cmv companies should be required to label their products to include the logo of their parent companies,so a while back my girlfriend and i were discussing the activities of the ceo of a certain large candy company we both came to the conclusion that what this person was saying was unethical and as a form of peaceful protest agreed to boycott their products for a time knowing that this was a large company and that it likely had daughter company or two decided to look up what we should be looking out for we were both surprised at what we found this particular company had spinoffs into beverages produce and even auto maintenance the sheer size and diversity of the list raised another issue this is not by any means the only company that does this kind of thing in a particular case these daughter companies obscured a monopoly which is not only antithetical to capitalism but is alarmingly easy to just slip under the radar even if people have a vague idea how corporations work companies had to be transparent about this public awareness of the sheer scale of these things would go up even if we collectively decide to nothing about it we could all benefit from the transparency,1,195,1164,103,0.038834951456310676

cmv the separation of church and state does not mean that morals cant be religiously sourced,the argument i make more specifically is that the separation of church and state means that an individual who is a government leader cant also be a religious leader at the same time this does not mean that any moral that comes from a religion or religious text cant be used in politics or that a voter is required to provide a nonreligious reason for their moral opinion and the way they vote reason i say this is this we try to separate politics and religion in our heads which is difficult because politics is in large part deciding what should and shouldnt be punished based on morals and whats good for society and religion is where many people get their ideas of what is right and wrong for example if india has many laws reflecting hindu values but their government leadership is not participating in religious leadership roles at the same time i dont see anything wrong with that the majority of india holds certain values they all vote and those values affect law and the law reflects the religious ideas of the majority of its citizens the government is still ran by its citizens not by a church   and this government is still not amorally influenced by a church just all of its voting citizens indian citizens shouldnt be required to show you where they got a moral from to show that its not influenced by hinduism and therefore a valid opinion to have say that it is illegal to eat a cow in india and someone could say to a indian your opinion is affected by your religion so it has no place in politics and shouldnt affect your vote then the indian believer says actually im not religious i just believe that it is wrong to kill and eat cows then what his opinion is now worth more because it came from a different source background i am a christian and i make this argument because it is common to hear you cant let that belief affect your vote and it should have no place in politics because it came from the bible i often think to myself well then fine lets say im an atheist i dont believe in god and this moral opinion i have is a result of some atheistic moral feeling or abstract reasoning and doesnt come from a religious text is it valid then i think all morals arent from science because theres nothing scientific about assigning value to human life or wanting to alleviate someone elses pain morals are things we take from our religion upbringing and a voice from inside us and we are entitled to our opinion no matter where it came from i suppose if you consider climate change a moral issue then there is an exception and probably a few others do understand as well that if the majority of a nation thinks a way that i dont then i should know that they determine the policy and i agreed to a democratic government and in turn agree to the laws elected by it i will vote the way i will and if im not the majority they won fair and square and thats the way it is got a o chem test tomorrow i should be studying for so im done commenting love from utah and i appreciate the intelligent brains that made awesome counter arguments,1,573,3152,94,0.02127659574468085

cmv youtube’s monetization policies and methods to crack down on “hate speech” are unfair and wrong,so i’ve used youtube for a long time mostly to watch educational videos about history i’m a big history buff especially about military history and world war ii one of my favorite channels is the timeghost group indy neidell and the team responsible for the great war world war two and more delivers quality educational content that is comprehensive engaging fun wellsourced relatively impartial and above all responsible they have many times emphasized the controversies and touchiness of the subjects they are covering such as the changing names of the places they use in the show timeghost posted that their videos have been demonetized and are not promoted by the youtube algorithms the reason they learned from contact with youtube is that videos covering “controversial subjects” aren’t monetized meaning they aren’t promoted by the algorithm the issue is that “controversial subject” includes all war political disputes genocide extreme political groups etc so by this definition youtube is basically saying they won’t monetize anything about human history much less world war ii here’s their summary of what happened for more details one of world war two’s videos may 18 1940 the episode focusing on the german attack against the allies was taken down by youtube for a “community guidelines violation” presumably the video was flagged because it contained footage of the wehrmacht in action while discussing the german offensive to their credit the video was later restored but it should have never happened at all is this an isolated incident the channel knightsgc who made excellent high quality fan music videos example for sabaton songs combining the songs with historical footage and other historical media in a tasteful and dramatic way was banned for the same “community guideline violation” knightsgc released these music videos on a wide variety of sabaton songs—the video for the song “ghost division” which again depicts the wehrmacht cannot possibly be interpreted as endorsing nazism is a pervasive problem i have with youtube’s attempts to clear out hate speech and neonazism they are systematically demonetizing alienating and eliminating responsible creators educational videos about wwii have been taken down because of using nazi imagery timeghost one of the best educational producers has been wronged youtube’s algorithms are far too stringent to the point where they are literally censoring history and penalizing good creators think now more than ever in a climate of rising white nationalism we need good coverage of nazism and what it led to those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it and people who cover nazism in a responsible way should not be penalized youtube’s methods of removing hate speech are immensely destructive to this and are unfair,1,446,3643,100,0.05
cmv transgender individuals should compete with their biological gender,big edit i goofed biological gender isnt a thing i meant biological sex sorry for the miss  start off im cis but very protransgender rights and i have a lot of transgender friends thats one of the reasons that im bringing this up despite my support the way i see it transgender individuals should compete with the sex they were assigned at birth at least from the collegiate level and i worry that this belief may be based in some inherent bias which i would hope to extinguish for the sake of my friends reason i justify this belief is the fact that we separate the sexes for sports theoretically based upon the biological advantage that men have over women if we are basing sport segregation off of biological makeup of the players then it makes sense to me that transgender individuals compete with the team they are biologically a part of i understand that it may be restricting for many people who are transgender and want to compete in sports but may not feel comfortable competing with a gender they dont identify as but i also feel that for many female athletes it may put them at a disadvantage being required to compete with individuals that have a strong biological advantage and presenting this disadvantage goes against the spirit of segregating sports by sex in the first place suppose the main thing that could change my view is that the biological advantage is not that strong or that those that transition lose their biological advantage but im open to hearing other ideas disclaimer i dont know if im entirely pro full sex segregation in general i would honestly prefer something more like what the international chess leagues do which is allow for female competitive spaces but also provide for both sexes to compete together,1,306,1817,72,0.05555555555555555
cmv cheating is unforgivable because it shows horrible character and lack of self control forgiving this shows lack of self respect,edit when i said forgive i meant forgiving and continuing the relationship looked up similar posts and still dont understand the argument for cheating i noticed that cheating has been normalized  in the media and in real life people have straight up told me to expect to be cheated on because men are like mindless animals that lack selfcontrol which i wont believe so please dont use this argument its sexist if you ask me me first define cheating cheating is telling your partner you wont be having a sexual or romantic relationship outside your relationship but still doing it its not considered cheating to me if its an open relationship or you were forced with violence and whatnot when talking of relationships i mean mutual relationships that have or had love in them i dont want to hear of forced marriages abusive relationships or bad arranged marriages cause those have a very different dynamic from what im thinking about the passion has died in your relationship it is better to break off the relationship i dont mean divorce though cause i know that involves money and can be messy but people can acknowledge the death of a relationship and separate at least  me if you cheat that means you dont love your so if you really love your so and understand the pain it would cause them you wouldnt consider cheating its a horrible thing to do and serial cheaters come off as sociopaths if your so is having problems sexually and you cheat thats basically showing that sexual satisfaction was more important than the emotional bond you shared theres also many ways to attempt to resolve this issue and if its that big of a deal and unsolvable you can move on to an open relationship or separatebreak up cheating is a form of emotional abuse and forgiving it and getting back together is pretty naive they say they wont do it again until they are doing it again except this abuse is more covert who take back those who cheat come off as extremely desperate for the financial benefits in the relationship andor the emotional support they felt in the relationship i feel when people take back people who cheat its because they dont feel theyll ever find anyone to replace what they had which can be a valid point but still saddesperate imo i feel its a better bet to live the rest of your life without a cheater than with someone who will disrespect your emotions like that feel this all makes perfect sense but its like the older i get the more people are acting like im living in fantasy land beautiful independent women are taking back horrible men after cheating with multiple women great men are taking back women who cheat too whats going on,1,474,2762,134,0.03731343283582089

cmvsuicide is an acceptable right of any adult even if they arent physically in pain or dying,"not including people with deathly illnesses or with dibilitating and painful health issues believe that people in emotional and psychological pain be allowed to commit suicide and that actions to stop them via the government and health officials is wrong additionally i believe that intervention  by friends and family to seek help because of the familys own emotional reasons ex they will miss the suicidal person and be affected by such a situation is wrong and should not be thrust upon the person as reasons to avoid what they believe is the solution to their problems  are some quotes from great thinkers on the subject
 they tell us that suicide is the greatest piece of cowardice that suicide is wrong when it is quite obvious that there is nothing in this world to which every man has a more unassailable title than to his own life and person

cmv movements and campaign where the overall message is that every woman is beautiful misses the mark at best and is exploitative at worst,thinking specifically of a campaign such as dove’s real beauty or movements such as body positivity i agree that women should not be ashamed if they do not have the proportions of models and actresses telling women that they are beautiful no matter what is problematic and this is why only is that statement by definition false everyone can’t be above average most people are averagelooking but more importantly it perpetuates the idea that women have to be attractive to be valuable  better movement would ignore women’s appearance together and focus on their contribution to society this is why i really get behinds movements such as the push to get more women in stem fields  it is much better marketing for dove to run a commercial saying “we think you are all beautiful and that’s great” opposed to “some of you are unattractive and most of you are about average but that’s ok because you have other more important ways to contribute” feel that as long as a woman’s worth is being tied to her appearance we are perpetuating a lot of the sexism and objectification that has kept women down in the past  has been a pretty good convo i just want to add and clarify a few things my central thesis was what i said in the title some people chose to focus on my statement that by definition most people can’t be above average that borders on semantics and while it is an important part of the conversation the crux of my cmv was that emphasizing that everyone is beautiful perpetuates that women have to be beautiful to be seen as valuable or worthy  people also focused on my comment on stem fields this was merely an example of a movement that does a better job of empowering women it was an example it could have been teaching financial literacy self defense anything  thanks for the feedback my biggest takeaway is that beauty may not necessarily follow a bell curve distribution and i gave that comment a delta  ,1,348,2005,140,0.02857142857142857
cmv cultural appropriation is counterproductive towards attempts to ease racial discrimination the modern concept of cultural appropriation is inherently racist due to the cultural barriers that it produces,as an asian i have always thought of the western idea of appropriation to be too excessive i do not understand how the celebration of anothers culture would be offensive or harmful in the first place culture is meant to be shared the coexistence of two varying populations will always lead to the sharing of culture by allowing culture to be shared trust and understanding is established between groups  the psychology of an individual is greatly influenced by culture understanding ones culture means understanding ones feelings and ideas if that is the case appropriation is creating a divide between peoples treating culture as exclusive to one group only would lead to greater tension between minorities and majorities in the long run i learned a lot thank you for the replies guys im really happy to listen from both sides of the spectrum regarding this topic as ive come to understand how large history plays into culture of a people,1,160,985,209,0.023923444976076555
cmv lie detectors are highly inconclusive and people should stop insisting on using them as a method for determining the truth,"lie detectors measure certainly physiological responses such as blood pressure pulse respiration and skin conductivity these do not necessarily correspond with truth telling though they would often correspond with discomfort nervousness excitement etc  skilled polygraph administrator could use psychological tactics to get omissions from people but this usually relies on the person believing that lie detectors actually reflect whether someone is being deceptive which they do not  me it seems absurd that polygraphs are still used in the hiring process of certain federal positions it also frustrates me when there is some accusations and people in the media call out for these people to take a polygraph as if a polygraph can settle whether someone did or did not perform a crime

cmv the antigmo movement is slowing down progress and possibly harming the consumers as well,"this does not stop just at gmos the same is true for artificial sweeteners all organic produce and beef being able to genetically modify our food gives us the ability to design plants to better suit human consumption we can engineer plants to make pests avoid them removing pesticides and making the plant healthier we can make them grow better which means more food and less people hungry
the main reason for veganism is so animals don’t get killed but scientists are trying to grow meat in labs which means cruelty free meat but with the current stigma against gmos and similar subjects amazing technologies such as lab grown meat could be delayed by decades

cmv it is unrealistic to expect to have 50 of a film crew on major films and television to be women,"edit 1 it is unclear to me whether kings quote is referring to women casting or women in production roles i have data regarding production roles below if anybody has some for women casting that would be awesome 2 super interesting discussions being had many being had regarding race as well as gender ive responded to as much as im willing to tonight but will reply to more in the morning i can confidently say that my view is evolving as i read more comments and hear various perspectives and rebuttals  the golden globes regina king stated “the reason why we do this is because we understand that our microphones are big and we are speaking for everyone” she said “and i just want to say that i’m going to use my platform right now to say in the next two years everything that i produce i’m making a vow — it’s going to be tough — to make sure that everything that i produce that is 50 women” respect king as an actress and think that she has good intentions in bringing more representation to women in the film industry that said i think its entirely unrealistic statistically speaking and based on the mater of supply and demand   more women are in the film industry especially roles such as composer director and cinematographer then truly 50 could be possible that said i find it unfortunate and slightly sexist that she would pick someone based on gender instead of ability or best fit for the rolejob  terms of statistics in the top 100 films of 20172018 women comprised of the following  of directors of writers of cinematographers of producers of executive producers of editors king has oversimplified getting women on to her future projects and doesnt understand the way supply and demand work in terms of the job market and availability  open to opposing viewpoints and even willing to admit that maybe i dont have the perspective of it others might have change my view

cmv voting in ignorance or indifference is irresponsible and an abuse of a democratic right more so than not voting at all,"there seems to be an inherent stigma when it comes to voting you must vote are what i feel are legitimate reasons as to why someone might not want to vote i dont want to support any of the individual candidates with my vote i havent felt strongly enough about any of the parties or candidates
2 i dont believe that my vote counts for anything due to the voting system in place in britain we have a firstpastthepost system live in a particular party stronghold you might as well just close your eyes and draw an x
3 i dont feel that i know enough about the possible outcomes of the election if i dont understand or care about the implications of my vote then its frankly irresponsible for me to cast a vote are some of the common arguments ive seen and acknowledged but havent changed my mind spoil your ballot paper this process seems simply arbitrary and petty
2 if you dont vote you cant complain this is my most hated political platitude to me its not far off being pure social manipulation in order to get you to adhere to the system and force you into an opinion see reasons above a vote shouldnt ever be considered as means to buy an opinion
3 some countries dont have democracypeople died for your right i have voted before and am a full supporter of democracy i wholeheartedly appreciate those who have fought for my right to be free i feel that my right not to vote is equal to my right to vote this isnt a but they are mutually exclusive in my eyes being forced to vote by any means is undemocratic
4 theres no excuse to feel disenfranchised its your responsibility to educate yourself this i agree with though i dont see it as any legitimate reason as to why i should vote i can educate myself on and assess all the candidates and still not want to vote for any of them per the rules of this sub i am here to have my mind changed id just like a logical reason why im wrong to feel the way i do i didnt expect so many replies im trying to read them all its great this has sparked such good discussion i feel that i need to clarify a few things so im leaving the edit at the top in order to prevent confusion i dont feel that i know enough is a selfacknowledgement that the individual does not know enough come election day and therefore imo is responsible not to vote in that circumstance this does not tie in to if you dont vote you cant complain as i dont see why this person should vote at random in order to be entitled to complain do i think they should complain would be weird if they did should i refuse to respect their opinion because they didnt vote absolutely not i respect someone who admits they just dont know thats a favourable outcome to me
2 im seeing a lot of comments along the lines of not voting  not caring  a vote should not buy you a right to complain in a democracy you should have that right already you should not have to vote in order to care or take part the logic just isnt there ii still seeing comments about supposedly not caring i can only see this as an emotional respose so its not that helpful also theres a lot of nitpicking over my reasons why someone might not vote define ignorant has been posted numerous times instead of reasons why the individual should 
2 im most convinced that should i not know who to vote for i should spoil my ballot im surprised that it wasnt brought up more despite me calling it petty to me it makes the most sense im leaving the house and participating so i earn my complaint token ive done my research and still not felt that i can morally cross a box most of the replies have been in annoyance that i havent picked a side and that theres no excuse for not having picked a side i think thats really poor dont vote cant complain i dont actually think that voting gives you any more legitimate means to complain brexit is a prime example if you voted to remain in the eu you are labelled a remoaner or a loser youre told that you cannot complain about the outcome of a democratic vote in the worst case people have been described as traitors for protesting the outcome of the referendum a vote buys you nothing in that situation also if you didnt vote in an election you may well regret it there is no logical reason why your opinion is invalid where does that logic end  forward i probably wont opt to abstain from an election spoiling my ballot is the way to go when im on the fence i do care i do pay attention i do wish to excercise my right i dont however think i need to pick a side if i really cant post was born out of many things mainly due to recent elections in the uk where i was completely torn about who to vote for my ususal party was not aligning with the values that i hold i did vote but i dont feel great about it",1,909,5043,125,0.032
cmv tenure for university professors should not exist and creates a culture where teachers don’t need to care about their students course work to keep their jobs,"i am a senior at towson university in maryland and over the course of my four years here i can say with confidence that i have only had 2 teachers that genuinely care about the students in the class and making sure we actually learn the material not just memorize it for a test and forget it right after my opinion and experience teachers who have tenure do not care about the students at all and they give off this nonchalant almost apathetic vibe and it feels like we come to class and the teacher just goes through the motions and just gives the lecture and lets us leave and i end up teaching myself the entire semester anyway during high school or my freshman year i wouldn’t be opposed to this at all because all my classes weren’t that important now i’m taking major classes and required courses i need to graduate on time and this is the way my teachers are going about it  to give everyone an example from this semester 
after my first test this semester in finance 331which for some reason is the intro class in the business school a little more than half the class failed the test our teacher gets up in front of the room and says to us “come on guys this really isn’t that hard if i can do it so can you” 
how exactly am i supposed to be comfortable talking to this teacher or going to his office hours to ask for help if i’m being ridiculed for not understanding the material and on top of that how does this teacher not get reprimanded or punished in some capacity for more than half the class failing the first test my answer is tenure this professor and other professors who behave this way did not have tenure they would be forced to actually teach the class in a way that the whole section would understand and not just throw on the powerpoints and call it a day may just be an issue at my university but i just want to know other’s opinions and see if my view is skewed or biased just from being at my school thank you for all the replies my view really has been changed i misunderstood the real definition of tenure and the real job responsibilities of a university professor i still encourage everyone to read the whole thread and add to the discussion",1,412,2224,163,0.03680981595092025

 them going bankrupt wouldnt stop any of this i mean the planes and airports will still be there hell even the employees could be transferred to new ownership like a typical company buyout no 
 to mention the audacity these companies have to spend most of this bailout money on stock buybacks instead of fixing the core problems of the company

cmv harry potter has an awful magic system which severely weakens the plot,"read this folks this is a really cool conversation i am enjoying hearing your points of view but i have to go to bed now shits late
i will pick up on replying to more of these and continuing this sometime tomorrow after my lectures
   shit this has exploded i never expected this to get as big as it has i am slowly working my way through the different arguments  seems very evident that i failed to highlight the main point of my argument as people are diving into semantics arguments focusing on specific side points to the overall message  basis of what i am arguing is better explained here  everyone and their grandmother is getting held up on the wandless magic point referencing pottermore and the later books where that is established but that was just a symptom of the overall issue i have with the series which is better outlined in that comment and this one as well last half of that comment  may be arguments that convince me already on the post but due to how complex these posts are its taking me some time to get through and evaluate them all  there so to start things off yes harry potter is a good story i am a fan of the book series overall but this issue is a major gripe for me i have not read the books recently this is a thought holdout that ive had for years
i love stories that set out the rules for a magic system and then navigate their plots through that system while keeping it consistent  couple examples of a consistent magic system are eragon and the kingkiller chronicles on the macro scale both of these systems are very similar the magic that happens is rooted in an energy balance  kc you can light a cigarette by taking energy from your own body or a nearby fire etc which will then cool as a result and the further away something is the higher the cost eragon all actions require a similar energy its a bit more ethereal than kc but still has very defined limits users cant do very much before they are exhausted so they need to draw on sources of power such as other people or stored potential energy that was previously harvested point is that these relationships are established early on in the book series and while characters refine their abilities and learn more about the magic system the base rules continue to apply 
in harry potter the rules are laid out in some of the initial magic lessons but as the series progress almost everything that has been established gets thrown away  worse in many cases whole plot devices are reliant on just some new form of magic that the reader had no idea was a possibility  exceptional spell pronunciation and precise wand movement is explained to be essential for a spell to function at all but then later we end up losing the pronunciation and wand movement entirely magic can just happen wordlessly and without a wand   theres essentially no limit to a magic users abilities once you figure out a spell for the first time you could cast avada kedavra all day long  magic detection is entirely inconsistent they can use the trace to detect any magic from someone underage anywhere but cant at all tell when someone in the middle of the ministry of magic in under a polyjuice potion what is this huge magic detection network that allows the trace to work how is it not being used for other things spells have a mind of their own ala accio and crucio incredibly overpowered items like the timeturner effectively break the universe remember having other examples but it has been a while since i read the books bolded this for emphasis this is the thesis of my argument
 summary
to me it feels like jk wrote herself in to corners fairly often and then had to default to because magic as the solution it really irritated me when i read the series for the first time and i have never been convinced otherwise by friends when harry potter gets brought up

cmv if you are an hourly worker you owe the company you work for the 40 hours they pay you and nothing more,theres an idea thats pervasive in employment that you and your coworkers are a family and that you should be passionate about working there which can mean eating lunch at your desk and working through lunch so that hopefully they see you as good enough to let you stay as opposed to getting some sort of promotion or raise or that you stay after hours for free i see all of this as way for employers to subtly take advantage of their employees while owing them nothing in return simultaneously theres this relatively new understanding that employees are all on their own that they cannot expect their employers to be looking out for them or their interests again employers wanting you thinking about whats best for the company but its a one way street as they will not be looking out for you see this sort of behavior from the employer as very bad for the employee and that people in this situation should start collectively adopting the mindset that they owe their company the hours that they pay them and nothing more this is especially true if you are working extra so that maybe your employer will let you stay as if its some sort of privilege to be working at their company as opposed to some sort of hope that they will be promoted you should not feel obligated to give them any extra work beyond what they are paying you in that scenario,1,246,1368,109,0.03669724770642202

cmv organ donation should be opt out not opt in in the us,"in the us organ donation is an option that people must select to participate in when they are getting a license or id the default setting is that everyone is opted out of the organ donation program and must actively choose to have their organs donated after their death instead of allowing people to opt in to organ donation i believe the us should make organ donation the default because it will result in more people donating their organs a psychological standpoint humans tend to gravitate towards decisions that have already been made for them it is easier to go along with a premade decision than it is to change it by requiring people to sign up for organ donation the us makes it unnecessarily difficult albeit not that much to be an organ donor addition the opt out policy has proven to get more people being organ donators than the opt in system stanford discussed this here where they looked at austria a country that by default has everyone signed up as an organ donor this results in around 90 of people donating their organs compared with the 15 donation rate in the us  is a huge demand for organs in the us to help save the lives of thousands of people many of these people are put on waiting lists but die before an organ is made available for them the us could potentially change this or at least alleviate it by adopting an opt out policy for organ donation

cmv the walking dead isnt that good,"first let me admit theres incredible episodes such as conquer last day on earth and the same boat and that the show isnt terrible    
my main problem with with it its that its boring a gigantic part of it is characters being emotional and giving monotonous sometimes incomprehensible speeches or figthing with each other instead of things actually happening and theres another gigantic part of the show that shit sorta happens but theres no tension like when the walkers came for alexandria or the barn      
theres a reason for this yeah the show is trying to be realistic but the point of fiction is not to create another reality with maximmum acuraccy to our reality its to create a more interesting reality than ours our world is boring as shit        
the show is also predictable the group finds a settlement shit happens and a lot of people die rick magically saves everybody and recruits new people on his crew cycle repeats the new people on his crew are probably boring as fuck like noah or deanna and theyre mostly the ones that die this is made so that the show can kill a shitton of people and still avoid killing characters enjoyed by the public    
another unpopular opinion while we are at that by the way shane is one of the best characters in the show and he was mostly right except for almost raping lori

cmv leaving ad newspapers in someones driveway or sticking your ad in someones house door should be considered littering and a punishable crime,newspapermagazine bundles am currently not subscribed to any sort of newspaper or magazine service yet i get a newspaper bundle or magazine bundle wrapped in a plastic bag thrown into my driveway at least once a week sometimes its in a spot i dont see right away because its dark when i get home or because its on the edge of my driveway and lawn so at least once a week i have to go out there and pick up what is essentially garbage off my property and throw it in the trash then i wonder how long it was there making my house look bad ads also tend to get a lot of people shoving adds into the crack between my door and door frame this can be anything from local restaurants to local churches to lawn service ads despite my lawn obviously already looking wellmaintained many times these dont stay in the door and end up blown by the wind into my flower bed or yard only to sometimes not be noticed until they have been degraded by the wind and rain and just like the newspaper i have to go out there and clean up the trash that someone intentionally placed on my property understand that people have had varying degrees of success in calling these companies and asking them to leave you alone but it shouldnt be allowed in the first place i shouldnt have to call someone and ask them to not leave trash on my property leaving behind paper and plastic products along the side of the road is litter why is it allowed to happen on my property i think leaving these unwanted ads in someones yard driveway or door should be considered littering and a punishable offense cmv this is a footnote from the cmv moderators wed like to remind you of a couple of things firstly please read through our rules if you see a comment that has broken one it is more effective to report it than downvote it speaking of which downvotes dont change views any questions or concerns feel free to message us happy cmving,1,357,2223,147,0.027210884353741496
cmv religion is the biggest cause of problems in the world today and it should be treated much like conspiracy theories,okay goodbye karma first off i am still in support for freedom of religion i believe that to take away freedom of religion is to take away freedom of thought and that would be a horrific crime there is too much of this orwellian intent to take away our thoughts the extreme left thinks it should be criminal to dislike a certain group whereas the extreme right things it should be criminal to be gay light of this i dont advocate in any way laws that restrict religion unless your religion affects other people there should be no political outing of religion but heres the unpopular bit so get your downvotes ready should be stigmatized it should be treated at least with the ridicule that conspiracy theorists face and at most with the hatred with which we treat racists and homophobes is the root of so many problems through one catalyst religion has blinded many to the notion of critical thinking and science we as a society are too reliant on pseudoscience and plain ignorance the far right in america is packed with people who dont believe in climate change and the left is filled with people who dont support modern medicine fanaticism and pseudoscience is rife in todays society and it seems only to come from religion and indoctrination now many people were raised by atheists and in a way were taught atheism this did not come from critical thinking and is just as accidental as being raised religions and sticking with it so there are many atheists that are not the scientific freethinking humanists you hear about on ratheism is in direct conflict with science and it is building a divide between those raised by religion and those raised without i believe that without religion we would be a more scientifically driven society and we would benefit greatly in many regards education would benefit from it climate change would be a primary political focus and we would be a more tolerant society in regards to that which isnt crazy like religion another reason why its religion thats holding us back a political party comprised of the most accomplished physicists chemists engineers sociologists psychologists etc talking like if brian cox neil degrasse tyson bill nye and the likes formed a party where their agenda would be a response to problems in both social science and natural science why is this good because scientists have a certain mindset scientists care about the truth and only the truth they dont care nearly as much about manipulating people they dont care about becoming rich if they cared about becoming rich they wouldnt have stayed at university for that long they would have dropped out after their masters and got a job as an engineer well bill nye did that after his bachelors but hes still better than trump or hilary why wouldnt this work because america is over 70 christian according to census and im sure a lot of them would hate the idea of an atheistic government there is no way that party could be elected into power at all in basically any country and its for that reason that i know this post is going to get a fair bit of shit from both the religious and the blind atheists that think the key to happiness for all is letting everyone perpetuate their myths freedom of religion is politically necessary but religion itself is the biggest issue on todays society,1,580,3500,122,0.03278688524590164
cmv as a white heterosexual male i dont feel wanted or welcome by the left and am nervous to vote for a leftist candidate,"edit thank you all for your feedback and im really sorry if im slow to respond im trying to listen to everybody but youre all writing interesting and longthoughtout posts so its becoming increasingly difficult i just want to clarify for the new readers ive basically yielded that white is not really an important word in my prompt there isnt much i describe below that singles out white men its more of a men thing in general i also want to clarify that i am almost entirely determined on voting for blue candidates this fall the prompt should be read as im begrudgingly voting blue for sure but worried that blue doesnt care about me many of you have already expressed that this is a systemic shortcoming of a twoparty system  not necessarily a specific targeting or lack thereof thank you all for your input and ill try my best to continue replying 2 guys im really sorry  this blew up to an extent far greater than i can respond to im not trying to ignore newer posts and im sure there are others who are lurking to read what you have to say but im getting flooded here im very thankful for that but it also means most of you probably wont see a reply from me im very sorry havent had a cmv post this large before  had no idea how overwhelming it can get thank you for all of your different perspectives it helps a lot  some this probably sounds like the most privileged post youve ever heard to you id say im sorry because im really not trying to upset anybody but rather express a frustration i very dearly want to vote against the republican party come this midterm just for a quick snapshot of my political opinions i want tighter tax doctrine imposed upon corporations and the wealthy coupled with lower taxes for submedian income groups i want overseas funds to return from these corporations
 i want a political party that doesnt take corporate handouts hahahahahaha and doesnt spit on the likes of the homeless
 i want socialized healthcare and socialized higher education
 i want nuclear energy with supplemental wind solar hydroelectric and geothermal
 i want lgbtq to feel as welcome and wanted in this country as the rest of us
 i want a clear pathway to citizenship that gets everybody paying their taxes and able to access affordable healthcare and the other perks of citizenship i want the children of the immigrant families returned and i want the people in charge of the horrible shit that has happened to them brought to justice
 i want a foreign policy that is warm and trusting of the eu  nato and standoffish against russia
 i want men and women to continue to step forward to unveil the horrible sexual scandals that have been occurring in the entertainment industry and elsewhere i want these pieces of shit brought to light and i am happy to see a guilty persons entertainment career torched because of how they treated their coworkers and the general public can continue but i just want to get the point across that i really do intend to vote for a leftleaning candidate however my frustration is that i do not feel welcome by this party most recent democratic presidential candidates including bernie sanders hillary clinton and barack obama have been guilty of using the same 77centsonthedollar statistic to describe a problem that has nothing to do with 77centsonthedollar clinton and obama both have discussed in their respective campaigns troubling statistics such as suicide rates or incarceration of women while glossing over how disproportionately fucked men are in these categories politicians and citizens try to assign discrete weight to every social issue the issues facing white men can go on the backburner or be ignored because someone else has it worse
 no democratic candidate in the past two general elections to my knowledge has ever summoned statistics such as the suicide gap the horrendous state of us divorce and custody trials the terrifying way in which a false rape accusation for a college  graduate student likely means the end of their career domestic violence against men  lack of public resource available to help abused men etc if they ever said something about problems like this my guess is that they said it in passing sandwiched between a statistic about women and a statistic about lgbtq i imagine they avoided these issues because they would probably correctly feel that they would be cast out as democratic candidates for failing to pass muster here
 with sarah jeong still holding her seat at the new york times and the nyt being a usually leftleaning news source its pretty clear that leftist media is not afraid of being racist toward white men or at least they are not afraid of being controversial when it involves white men but stay away from woman  minority controversies like the plague
 any time a white man discusses the issues which are specific to white men they are considered either racist redpillers or both i think this point is incredibly dangerous because if a leftleaning voter feels cast out by their own party you know who they want to go to jordan peterson and ben shapiro and all of those fuckin guys telling them that theyre right to feel frustrated because blahblahblah and then you know the far right has their own perpetuated narratives too and none of its good bernie sanders was in my opinion a very strong egalitarian candidate but hillary clintons team coupled with some bullshit editorials from the wapo and nyt calling bernie supporters bernie bros was all it took to torch his campaign that is a pathetic weakness for a political candidate on the national stage
 the republican party has essentially installed a catchnet for any democrats who fall out with their party over controversial social stuff trump may be a madman but if he and his crew are the only people talking about the issues that white men face who the fuck do you want someone who is concerned about the lack of concern for white men to go think a major weakness of the current state of the democratic party moving forward is that they demand 100 loyalty on social issues and have completely abandoned an organized fiscal or foreign policy plan democratic candidates can rise and fall in an instant depending on whether or not they made a rude comment to a secretary during the primaries but if clinton feels hawkish against russia or wants to abandon  trash some key trade deals thats all fine according to her voters as long as she talks about wage gaps she can be whatever type of diplomat she wants a major strength of the current state of the republican party is that theyve leveraged themselves in such a way as to capture dissent within the democratic party when voters inevitably fall out just want a candidate that gives equal airtime to every demographics issues i want someone who acknowledges that everyone has major fucking problems and not try to continue a narrative that the furthers the goals of a particular group only the left does a very good job recognizing the bullshit lies and narratives that the right commits against their own voters but are you fully aware of the shit happening in your own party do you want to see what happens in a court when a female teacher has relations with a male student do you want to see what happens when a virgin with a 40 at harvard gets accused of raping a woman i understand that you need to say some things to appeal to each voterbase right so if you make a pit stop and give a 1 hour speech in a hispanic community you need to make mention of some hispanic community issues and what you plan to do to fix them thats just what makes good political sense where is the democrat candidate making the same appeal to men do they care are we supposed to accept that nobody gives a shit that men get wrecked disproportionately in divorce cases false rape accusations occupy the majority of prison cells and are the majority of homeless underestimate the voting plurality of white men  old men divorced men bored men picture this voter a man is on the hook for child support often times even when the woman earns more money a man fails in the majority of custody cases his life has been ripped away by a vengeful woman he is pushed into a deep depressive state with suicidal urges he hears from the wapo how female suicide rates are rising while not a peep about men or how close he was to pulling the trigger yesterday he hears from vox how the patriarchy does mysterious dare i say deep state type shit all the while a woman and a female judge just took his life away where the fuck do you expect him to vote theres a red candidate whos a little extreme on guns mind you but hes the only one who told him his problems matter dont want this to be a red midterm and lord willing it isnt going to be but for fucks sake people how many more times do i have to hear the same bs statistics to further the same bs narrative all the while scoffing at how the right uses bs statistics to further the same bs narrative",1,1602,9247,126,0.05555555555555555
cmv the metric system is objectively better and there is no advantage to the imperial system over metric system,"edit this blew up please read the disclaimer before posting many people clearly skipped that also i apologize for not being able to respond to everyone my answers may seem a little rushed because they are i will try to get to everyone with decent arguments later i am sorry for this arrogant sentence but i cant respond to all arguments i will focus on the decent ones  i am talking about all types of units in the imperial system inch foot lb oz and metric system metre liter kilogram not just one in particular while it is mostly aimed at weight and length units the cost of changing from the imperial system to the metric system is not a part of this argument because that is not an argument in favor of the system but in favor of not changing it indeed the cost would be very high and most likely only worth it in the very long run think that there is literally no job that the imperial system has which is not done better by the metric system the metric system is easier to work with as it has a 10base system since the metric system has a 10base system it is very easy to convert units into other units not just hierarchically but you can also convert volume units into weight units etc people often argue that it is easier to imagine the imperial system because it works with human feet inch etc which is hardly true since the average foot length depends on gender and genetics the error that you make by assuming the length of eg a rope is equal to the error you make by assuming the same lenght in metres considering you are accustomed to the units  that is considering the average foot length differs by 25 cm from the actual foot unit length and the variation in the population is huge even though normally distributed the imperial units themselves are defined in metric units because otherwise you would have no way of telling the exact size of each unit most science in the us and uk is done in the metric units anyway because they are much easier to work with i think that it is not only objectively better because it posesses advantages i listed and possibly more but that the imperial system has actually not a single factor in which it would be better than the metric system and therefore is subpar thus changing my view can either be accomplished with good arguments against the advantages of the metric system or by presenting an argument that the imperial system actually has advantages andor something the metric system cannot bring

cmv colleges guilty of participating in the admissions scandal should refund application fees,"note i am not a lawyer so forgive the sometimes notquiteright phrasingterminology i want to categorize the two types of admission scandals collegeenabled and noncollegeenabled by collegeenabled i mean the scandals involving bribing coaches of various sports or directly bribing other school officials to gain entrance into the university by noncollegeenabled im referring to the other scandals which i believe are a majority of the cases involved involving doctors diagnosing disabilities testcenter supervisors adjusting scores and things of that nature i want to define guilty colleges that have officials coaches admissions officers etc who are convicted in the upcoming trials of skewing admissions for personal gain not just those accused  innocent until proven guilty and all want to establish a few assumptions
1 that when i pay a frankly ridiculous amount of money to be considered at a school like georgetown i expect the considerations to be fair under their criteria i may disagree with those criteria ex the weight of an in person interview prioritizationrequirement of standardized tests or whether they prefer weightedunweighted gpas but i am entering into a goodfaith agreement again nal that those criteria will be applied 
2 that a school takes responsibility when the faults of its staff are not caught by the appropriate systems you can sue a school for butchering a title 9 investigation or if they failed to run background checks and one of their employees harasses you the extension of this assumption is that a school is at fault if their employees are taking bribes to rig schoolprocesses and there either a are no checks in place or b are not caught by existing checks
3 that a university has a “soft limit” of how many applicants they can accept this limit is variable and open to exceptions “we can squeeze another 15 in because they’re just so awesome but there is a maximum 
4 universities do not maintain a historical list ranking applicants ie there is no way to say “if we had 5 more slots these 5 people would have gotten in when they applied in 2012” footnote at the bottom if this is false that these individuals are found guilty of accepting bribes in the year arbitrary year represented by 20xx
i see no reason why universities should not return the initial application fees to those who applied in 20xx their people abused the system just as much as those doing the bribing the honest applicants are the real victims if 15 people bribed their way into “generic college university” then 15 people were not accepted because of illicit activities given that it is not possible to determine who those 15 are all who were slighted – the entire applying class – are at a loss thus instead of pursuing damages hard to prove potentially immeasurable from not getting in the schools should simply refund application fees we paid for a service considering our applications fairly and the service was not delivered  if assumption 4 is false the argument stands but then those specific people who would have gotten in deserve the refund not the entire applying class ie 15 bribed their way in refund the 15 who would have gotten in also – in this scenario punitive damages for the difference in wages skills etc would still be difficult to calculate but would be much more manageable due to the smaller scale

scrolling through rworldpolitics rnews rpolitics is disappointing the vast majority of posts or articles are extremely left leaning all the comments say a specific right wing figure is a demon which ultimately creates a sort of bubble inside of reddit itself with little to no differing views such as my own as someone who identifies as libertarian with right leaning views i now completely avoid politics on reddit because there is nothing that i believe in for example rdemocrats has many times more followers than rgop for the record i think fox is an opiniontalk show channel while cnn is hysterical and unfounded most of the time what reddit needs is differing opinions that go against the mainstream “trump is hitler”

cmv abortion is preferable to raising a child on an unstable financial foundation and it shouldnt be regulated on a federal level,"id consider myself mostly conservative but still have some rather liberal ideas and this is one of them abortion has always been a really tough issue for me and i used to oppose it until i had a pregnancy scare with my so we were only 19 and her period was late i was terrified praying to the heavens to not have a child this early that im not ready luckily she got it eventually but ill never forget that heartsinking feeling in my chest and its made me a lot more empathetic towards those who get abortions id still like to hear all angles of this argument most conservative commentators dont go beyond its killing babies and jesus and seems to be the one issue where facts arent brought into question so for those who are against it please shed insight that isnt religiouslyrelated for those who are prolife id love to hear your perspective on this and answer these points unintended pregnancy rates for those below the poverty line are extremely high compared to higherincome families but abortion keeps that rate somewhat stable so that it doesnt reach unintended birth i believe that having a child prematurely in the midst of poor economic standing is the root of a lot of our societal problems most conservatives also hate how many are on welfare and id bet that many of those on it are due to having children prematurely why is abortion a worse outcome than raising a kid in the midst of personal financial turmoil teens are notoriously promiscuous with all the hormones raging during that age many losing their virginity at age 1314 even with contraceptives like condoms and birth control accidents can happen what would you suggest to a person pregnant in high school if not abortion should she really potentially suffer throughout her entire life with this mistake she made as a reckless teen even if she used contraceptives at what point in pregnancy does it become a life and why some conservatives believe that its a child at the moment of conception does this mean that plan b is just at immoral as abortion would you compromise or make exceptions for early stages of pregnancy as ive said even with contraceptives accidents can still happen sex is a huge driving force in our lives and we dont really notice how strongly our libido impacts our decisionmaking what could possibly be a solution to this major problem of unintended pregnancy premarital sex is just not viable an unrealistic goal
 conservatives usually oppose a strong federal government that can regulate a persons life choices such as wearing seatbelts do you believe abortion should be illegally mandated all across the nation or is it a states right issue and why i know this is an extremely rare margin of abortion cases but what would you suggest for rape victims surely they shouldnt be forced to care for a child that they had no choice in preventing right

cmv editorials should be excluded from search engine news results,"there is an important difference between an editorial and news although the line may be hard to define news should always ideally be fact based reporting while editorials or punditry should consist of analysis a good editorial shouldnt misstate or misrepresent facts but the viewer or reader may disagree with the opinion stated conversely a good news article should be fairly hard to dispute reason i bring this up is because i heard some rumblings about whistle blowers coming forward about the clinton foundation and possible tax law violations given the conspiracy communitys infatuation with the clinton hearsay as well as the fact they are a constant scapegoat for the right i am very wary of editorials about them and much prefer straight news  when i search for news on the subject all i get are editorials which are not held to a good standard of truthfullness the problem with fake news pervading our society i suspect many casual news readers dont readily differentiate between the two so heres what i think editorials should be very clearly described as opinion pieces by the organization news searches shouldnt include editorials either they should get a separate tab or just come up in general searches 
 have to go proctor a final so i wont be able to reply for a while think the best argument which was presented pretty consistently from different users is that this type of change would probably just lead to news organizations editorializing their news stories even more of users presented pretty good points about how bias can present itself even in news that contains only facts but may bend the truth with omissions or lack of proper context i think this is a good point but doesnt really address the question key idea was to put a more distinct divide between opeds and news sections even though the news may have some bias in theory it will be better than opeds from the same organization in terms of neutrality it isnt supposed to be a perfect solution but maybe a step in the right direction also many users seemed to think i wanted to censor opeds on the contrary i think they should be just as readily available as the news just more clearly classified as opinion  this brings us back to the first point in that it could lead to a degradation in the quality of news which many of us arent too happy with as is ",1,415,2445,69,0.07246376811594203
cmv marketing is an immoral form of manipulation,edit im talking specifically about direct marketing  the form concerned with making you take an action immediately not the sort of ads you would see on tv which are more concerned with brand awareness more the kind of ads youd see on facebook on the table  im a copywriter and i struggle with this idea sometimes and marketing rely on agitating peoples fears hopes and worries to motivate them to take some action that benefits the company doing the marketing abuses flaws in human psychology to manipulate people to do things they would likely never have done otherwise same principles behind it are being used by organisations like cambridge analytica to manipulate peoples political beliefs to benefit political groups  a counterargument ive heard which says that all we do is manipulate each other in some form to get what we want all we do is want things from each other love sex companionship work play art  can be an altruistic want like wanting your friend to cheer up or a selfish want like trying to get a raise from your boss we say or do what we think will best influence the other person to take the action we want  it that simple,1,208,1225,50,0.08
cmv the lack of a back button on an iphone is a dealbreaker,"edit my view has not been changed 180 degrees but its more nuanced and i now better understand the reasons people have to disliking a back button the biggest point for me is that while ios back functions are unintuitive by location different situations call for different navigation commandsnavigation buttons appear in different parts of the screen depending on the app the android back button is potentially unintuitive by function its always in the same place but pressing it may do something different from what you expected learned quite a bit about how to use the ios as well though some of them yielded more questions than answers thats another cmv for another day for now thanks for your responses really hate apples design philosophy in general but since i know my opinion is generally unpopular i decided to start small and post about one particular design decision  the lack of a back button why is the lack of one such a big deal to me a waste of space one of the biggest selling points of the iphone when it first came out and why almost everyone uses touchscreen phones now is the maximizing of screenspace  the screen takes up almost the entire area of the phone nevertheless almost every app needs a way to go back so there is a back button onscreen this takes up valuable screenspace when there is perfectly fine real estate either side of the home button which isnt doing anything inefficient in many situations take this situation im riding shotgun to an appointment and giving directions to the driver guy im meeting texts to ask if im on the way after replying to his message i want to go back to my navigation app as quickly as possible to make sure we dont miss a turn but instead of just pressing the back button i have to doublepress the home button find googlemaps then tap on it seems like a small difference but it really adds up take a more extreme but still relatively common scenario has just sent me a long email with external links for reference interspersed with the text every single time i click an external link i have to take extra steps to return to reading the email  extra steps that wouldnt have been necessary with a back button honestly navigating between apps using the home button makes about as much sense to me as cooking a dish and exiting and reentering the kitchen every time i want to add a different ingredient is unintuitive this is my biggest pet peeve because apple keeps marketing their products as intuitive and easy to use phones come with a back button that works in every situation it will either take you to the previous menu or back to the previous app you were using or back to your home screen since there is no back button on iphones the back function is worked into the apps on screen in most apps you can find the back button in the top left corner however there are many cases in which this isnt the case in safari the back button is at the bottom and you need to scroll upwards for it to even appear when viewing directions in googlemaps if you want to return to the map view you need to swipe the directions out of the way in some apps gmail for example theres no quick way to go back say ive checked my inbox and then go to check my spam folder there is no back button onscreen at all  i need to manually tap my folders and tap inbox from there other words while in a majority of cases i know that i can find a back button at the top left of the screen there are also numerous examples where this isnt the case and there are many situations in which i would need to learn how to do an extremely simple command go back might say that these are small inconveniences that no longer are relevant once you get used to it but the fact remains that they are easily fixed with the addition of a universal back button and that it is an especially bad design choice for a company like apple which claims to value intuitive design i bring this up in realworld conversation my friends are quick to point out that apples sales show that most people have no problem with the design of the iphone i concede that this is true however i would like to hear from you guys your views on how the lack of a back button is not a bad thing or how its a bad thing but youve learnt to tolerate it because of reason please

cmv neil degrasse tyson had a point,im seeing a whole bunch of memes and shitposts hanging shit on tysons tweet he made in response to the two mass shootings  i dont think shootings are a good thing im strongly in favour of gun control and i do dislike terrorism  tyson did was provoke conversation on a variety of issues that dont get the widespread coverage that a shooting has but have even worse effects  was absolutely right about people responding emotionally to issues as opposed to rationally because its exactly how people responded to his tweet instead of considering what he had to say and its relevance everyone just insulted him and called him insensitive  the time he said what he did may indeed be insensitive but id argue that no matter when he said it he would have been labelled insensitive my point is that according to the stats tyson listed there are more families mourning deaths of their loved ones due to medical complications than those whose family members were victims of mass shooting  sure you can call the last point i just made insensitive towards mass shooting victims but to ignore the issues tyson raised would be equally insensitive to people suffering from those problems  anyone could change my view id be very interested i added the link to the actual tweet in the first sentence 2 i’m not here for a gun control debate and yet so many people have hopped on the bandwagon of debating second amendment rights with me i’m not american and that topic is not what this cmv is about so i’m going to stop replying to comments about it 3 im going to put this here because its simpler my view has been changed based on two significant factors the way tyson phrased his tweet implied that medical errors suicide and the other issues werent being tackled comprehensively by governments and other corporate bodies as usilverscrub pointed out gun violence is problematic because its not just people not doing anything about it its that theres specific lobbying groups that exist to prevent anything being done about it  the percentage of deaths caused by each issue as uamishlatinjew stated the percentage of shootings that lead to fatalities is much much higher than car accidents medical errors even attempted suicides  me overly utilitarian but i dont find the mens rea argument particularly convincing a persons death is horrible and tragic regardless of why they died  all those of you arguing that poor timing and insensitivity is what makes tysons point invalid youre not very convincing when he maked his point doesnt change the validity of what he has to say this cmv isnt about tyson being a compassionate empathetic fella its about whether what he had to say was relevant  top of that as ive said quite a few times i dont think that this specifically is a much worst time than any other time he couldve posted this tweet imagine if instead of a day after the shootings he posted the tweet next week or in 2 months or in a year hed get just as much backlash then as hes getting now partly because the us has on average one mass shooting a day the wound is always fresh thats why i find the insensitivity argument unconvincing,1,560,3366,36,0.19444444444444445
cmv theres nothing inherently wrong with letting onejob towns die off,in generations past people commonly moved to mill towns mining towns etc for the opportunity provided they would pack up their family and go make a new life in the place where the money was as weve seen of course eventually the mill or the mine closes up and after that you hear complaints like this one from a currentlypopular rbestof thread small town america is forgotten by government left to rot in the rust belt until im forced to move away why should it be like that why should i have to uproot my whole life because every single opportunity has dried up here by no fault of my own because thats how you got there in the first place  im a big believer in social programs and social justice i think we should all work together to do the maximum good for the maximum number of people but i dont necessarily believe that means saving every single named place on the map why should the government be forced to prop up dying towns how is i dont want to leave where i grew up a valid argument,1,190,1043,75,0.05333333333333334
cmv it should be legal to sell one of your kidneys,"i believe anyone should be allowed to sell their healthy kidney and any organ they dont need to survive for that matter there are thousands of people on organ donor lists dying each year while waiting for a healthy kidney here in germany it is in fact the most requested organ in hospitals currently we are relying on the altruism and the initiative of those who are willing to donate their organs after brain death or those rare individuals who donate a kidney while they´re still alive this simply doesn´t work as there are almost ten times as many patients on waiting lists as there are organ donors  a market for kidneys would incentivize giving your kidney to those in desperate need and take care of the shortage that is inherent to the donation system another benefit of a kidney market would be to make black market trades obsolete the kidney removal would have to be strictly government regulated and only be performed under the highest standards of medical technology  my proposal relies on the presumption that the risks that come with removing an organ are minimized and accounted for in the price of the kidney i sincerely hope for an interesting discussion in response to multiple commenters i have to add a vital aspect of my proposed system
in order to not put buyers at risk of buying kidneys that are harmful to their health a medical evaluation of every potential seller would have to be perforned that outruled all people with nephrological conditions and drug addictions  am sorry for not including this in my initial post",1,270,1590,52,0.07692307692307693
cmv it is entirely fair to “assume” someone’s genderpronouns based on their apparent characteristics,"i encountered this flyer recently which is the basis for this post after looking into the topic some more i have some serious issues with the idea that it’s wrong to assume people’s gender or pronouns i will ignore most of the practical issues and focus on my fundamental disagreement with their outlook this is about gender not pronouns the pronoun issue is quite simple if someone asks you to use a certain pronoun use it if you don’t you’re an asshole simple as that these issues are rare and can easily be addressed like this or by saying your pronouns if you feel its necessary like with a preferred name unfortunately some activists have the idea that everyone has to  introduce their pronouns instead of making assumptions core idea that you can’t know someone’s gender by looking at them seems completely nonsensical to me if we break it down this is that “did you just assume my gender” crap that i know actual activists think is crap there’s a reason it’s become a meme the obvious differences we can observe are for all practical matters an intentional gender presentation that people want others to recognize it’s a combination of sex characteristics clothing appearance language and other stuff like voice that we’re good at recognizing society cares about this not only due to identity but due to sexuality sexual orientation makes absolutely no sense if we take seriously the idea of not “assuming people’s gender” this isn’t something trivial it’s a fundamental part of how we interact with each other points
 pronouns do clearly have a gender people will use specific pronouns because they align with their gender identity the claim that they do not is simply false names clothes and other things similarly have a gendered implication that gives information i’ve heard people say “today you can’t assume someone’s anatomy from their name or appearance” that is in fact exactly what gender does however how else are we supposed to know who has the genitals we desire also the woman has vagina man has penis thing is a description of reality something that is going to be true 99 percent of the time the point of a generalization is not to cover every situation and exception but to be useful in everyday life i believe this whole pronoun thing is really being pushed by a loud but super fringe feministsocial justice groups no one but these groups which have radical ideas about gender and sexuality actually thinks this is a good idea why universities and others like in this article play what is in effect lip service to these ideas i don’t really understand no one seriously ignores gender in how they perceive the world it’s worth underscoring that there is a lot of disagreement even among activists and lbgt people about pronouns different people have different opinions it’s not wrong or exclusionary to disagree with someone’s take three things i have heard though are 1 pronoun introductions turn into a “check the box” thing that everyone agrees is dumb 2 some transgenderother people feel patronized by this stuff and 3 it pressures people who might not be comfortable into discussing their gender believe you should make a reasonable inference based on what a person is most likely going for “assumption” is a maligned word “interpretation” or “inference” is more accurate usually this is obvious if it’s not then maybe you should ask this is rare and typically people are chill about it and if you make a mistake apologize and move on  important thing is just to respect the person’s wishes on how to refer to them because it’s their own identity the whole obsession with making it a normal thing to introduce pronouns or put them in email signatures or never make any references to a person’s gender is both unnecessary and absurd if really considered the bottom line is to be aware that you’re making assumptions not to stop making all assumptions for all these reasons and more i believe this issue is both deceiving and not the real issue it’s made out to be will be controversial have i characterized this correctlyam understanding it to me it seems like this is pushed mostly by an extreme but vocal gaggle of activists but this is admittedly from my perspective as a cisgender male so i would be interested to hear what actual transgendernonbinary people think of the issue and let’s try to discuss this in a civil manner",1,754,4591,102,0.0392156862745098
cmv the nra is a caustic force in the united states and any benefit they provide to gun owners is now an afterthought or side effect of shilling for gun manufacturers and potentially funneling foreign money into us elections,the nra started out as organization by and for gun owners they provided a real service to owners and the citizenship at large doing things in more recent history such as recommending and providing gun locks supporting the ffa and the creation of ffls supporting the exclusion of criminals and those with mental problems from owning guns in the gun control act of 1968 they also have a wide array of safety programs and training courses that they provide  at some point in their history probably at about the same time that other sources of income overtook membership dues as their primary source of revenue they became an organization whose sole purpose was to push more guns no matter whether there was a benefit or a detriment to society recently evidence is coming to light that they may have also become a funnel for hostile foreign powers to funnel money into us elections to again push for more guns and less restrictions something which doesnt seem to support that this would be in the best interest of the us,1,180,1384,228,0.04824561403508772

cmvif women have the right to be prochoice then men deserve the right to decline fatherhood,"hello cmv of all regarding my own ideas and politics i would consider myself a thatcherite and believe in individualism freedom and responsibility for our own actions more on this later this has potentially shaped my ideas on the matter but i thought id throw it out there please dont judge me on my politics but on the content of the cmv
i believe that in a free society people have the right to decide whether they should keep a baby or not women have the right to abort or raise a child however i believe that men deserve the same right after sex with regards to the child it takes two to tango if a mother decides to keep the child then the father deserves the right to accept or opt out of fatherhood including all of the repercussions and payments that could be associated with such understand that the state assumes the right of the child  the right of the parent however i believe strongly that the father has the right to continue to live his life without sinking payments into a child which was optionally chosen if a man decides he does not want to keep the child then he has the right to refrain from supporting it throughout its life on the opposite if a mother is given the option to keep a child willingly knowing the father does not want to then she is accepting the responsibility of raising a child by herself as she has no right to enforce payments on a consenting man who did not wish to have a child
obviously this excludes rape and all other implications this is only within consensual sex men deserve the right to decline fatherhood and refuse payments for a child they did not wish to claim responsibility for in a consensual prochoice environment slight confusioncomments regarding abortion i believe that it is solely the womans responsibility as to whether she should abort or not it is her pro choice however fathers have the right to opt out of fatherhood or responsibility for that child should the mother keep it
edit2 this is going pretty well some good discussions as suggested another way to put this would be committing to sex is not committing to parenthood 
thescamr worded this nicely
right now a woman cannot be compelled to be a mother either financially custodially or emotionally due to abortion or adoption pro choice advocates say when a woman consents to sex she is not consenting to motherhood op is asking whether men should also be free such compulsion and the same condition  consent to sex is not consent to fatherhood either financially custodially or emotionally this has sparked a really nice and balanced discussion so thank you cmv its a controversial topic because while men should have the same rights as women the rights of the child seem to take over that of the father but not the mother i think ubilly90 put forward the best argument against this

cmv the most ethical course of action is to take very drastic measures to stop climate change,i briefly cite my premises climate change is real if i wanted to discuss this fact then my title would be different i will not award deltas to people saying it is a conspiracy or a myth and is mostly caused by humans as per ipcc and stern review i will accept credible criticism of this claim  as per ipccs 15 celsius report published in late 2018 the damages of climate change are now unavoidable and we need to prepare for them in the next 20 years we will see drastic weather conditions loss of ecosystems and water stress no matter what we do have two arguments actual generations vs future generations the actions we take today to fight climate change however small will influence the well being of all the generations to come to make this a proper argument ill put it in mathematical terms unless there is a massive extinction of all humans the generations to come are virtually infinite therefore a marginal benefit for them would mean an infinite net benefit a marginal damage to them would be an infinite net damage it is ethical to take the most drastic actions possible right now to ensure no net damage developed vs underdeveloeped  with high levels of development have the highest levels of emissions which makes them the most responsible for the problem at the same time they also have the highest adaptability which means that when the damages of climate change do come they will be able to mitigate the effects in the mean time underdeveloped countries have had the lowest emissions making them the least responsible and will be the ones to suffer the most island states ─ like tuvalu which has already begun evacuating due to the rising sealevel ─ and arid states such as those in subsaharan africa will be the most affected while also being the ones that contributed to the problem the least conclusion which i intend to change by starting this discussion the most ethical course of action is to take extremely drastic measures to reduce the plastic pollution and green house gas emissions no matter what the cost is it is of the utmost necessity that all developed nations and all contemporary generations be pushed into a draconian regime of environment conservationism stating my conclusion in this way i am willful opening my reasoning to a line of critique maybe such drastic action would be more costly than a more moderate action so far the evidence ive found points to the contrary but im willing to open up my perspective in this respect only reservation i have in this discussion is that i will not admit unfounded arguments saying that climate change is a conspiracy or a myth i will consider any and all evidence regarding other points but will not respond to claims that there is no climate change you very much in advance and thanks for reading this this is a footnote from the cmv moderators wed like to remind you of a couple of things firstly please read through our rules if you see a comment that has broken one it is more effective to report it than downvote it speaking of which downvotes dont change views any questions or concerns feel free to message us happy cmving,1,553,3466,94,0.0425531914893617
cmv as a black teenager marvels way of bringing diversity is insulting and patronizing,"first off yes i am black its sad that i even have to say this when i talk about this elsewhere im called a racist but as soon as i throw this fact out the narrative totally changes  way marvel has gone around race swapping and gender bending characters for diversity is complete bs there are so many black and female characters in the comics marvel has been around since world war two and they have plenty to choose from but instead they decided to do this and say you need representation is this they can pick unique characters like monica rambeau and put them in which fits their narrative but then theyll needlessly change the appearance for diversity its so insulting as a young black man to be told that i can only relate to characters that look like me and its even worse that they take historically white characters and say here you go accept this or youre racist  doesnt care about people like me they only see  signs they cant even bring in enough original characters despite decades of source material they change white to black which is basically a damn handmedown  like us black people are just trophies to show off for them hey look here we have a black guy a woman  their commitment to this is highly questionable monica rambeau was turned into a child looking up to carol danvers ive read that rambeau was going to continue looking up to danvers and take inspiration from her which is bs were finally getting blade and got black panther and thats really it falcon taking the captain america mantel takes away what made him falcon and how they treated black characters before is absolutely horrible darwin from the x men is near omega level and he was killed off early

cmv nothing i can do will meaningfully contribute to ending climate change and pollution,hello im writing this because this is a rather pessimistic stance and i really hope someone can change my mind think that for some reason people seem to enjoy antagonizing themselves we are the ones causing climate change we are the ones killing the polar bears and walruses and penguins we are the reason why plastic is in the ocean and why  the rain forest is depleting i dont think its an individual issue if i were to cut out meat entirely stop purchasing anything made of palm oil only ever bike to school and never purchase anything made of plastic or with plastic packaging climate change would still be happening it might help slightly but not in the long run i am only one person people say that everyones actions will add up but i dont think that many people will ever sacrifice their current lives to save our planets future companies alone are responsible for 71 percent of global carbon emissions this shows that pollution is caused primarily by companies and corporations not by little people like you probably or me sure if everyone stopped buying toyota cars theyd probably stopreduce their emissions of carbon and drop off the list but i think its rather impossible to get everyone on board for that they will keep contributing to climate change whether they have 10 million customers or 9 million or even just 1 million america beautiful is a good example of where my opinion lies kab was created in the 50s by people like the pepsi and cocacola ceos theyre the ones that coined the term litterbug and fund beach cleanups and similar events i think this is rather despicable really rather than taking responsibility for the huge amount of plastic they manufacture with they shift all blame to individuals like you or me why should a bunch of people like us have to clean up the ocean for kab due to a problem almost entirely instigated by kab last thing i wanted to touch onthe self antagonizing stuff is especially bad for those of low incomes even if i wanted to cut out plastic and stuff entirely i along with what id argue to be most americans couldnt afford to ecofriendly products are typically much more expensive than standard ones cotton clothing is often much more expensive than clothing made of polyester dont think that using an led bulb rather than fluorescent or skipping a shower every other day or boycotting everything made of palm oil is really going to do anything this mentality is harmful not only for antagonizing people with low incomes but for shifting blame off companies and onto average people voting is a good start to solve these issuesholding politicians accountable for keeping companies corporations and net carbon emissions in checkbut i cannot yet vote hence the title nothing i can do overall though i think the solution isnt for us to take responsibility but for those with power to hold corporations and companies responsible please change my view and if there is something i can do that meaningfully impacts climate change please share that with me woah thanks so much for all the insightful comments and great discussion ive never had a cmv or post like this and i really appreciate all of the conversation right now thanks to you all ive changed my view to something like its good to strive to act environmentallyfriendly via recycling conserving energy etc as its the moral thing to do and ones actions may influence others alone nothing i can do will meaningfully contribute to ending climate change and pollution or create a longterm change however by acting as a unit with others and placing pressure on others a larger impact may be made framing climate change as solely an individual issue is still harmful not only for antagonizing people with low incomes but for shifting blame off companies and onto average people voting and lobbying are perhaps the best ways to combat climate change at this point that and not having kids didnt expect this many comments and i have homework to do so it might take me a while but ill try to reply to everyone thanks,1,705,4193,90,0.05555555555555555
cmv to become a police officer should require a four year degree,i have a firm belief that many instances of police brutality could be avoided through proper education to become a police officer should require a specially designed degree suited for the areas of knowledge required by a good cop local history criminology localfederal law martial arts local geography and the most important one of all psychology i can not believe we send these men and women out there unprepared to deal with everything from arguing spouses to murders without training them to understand why these people act the way they do  example of how psychology could help cop that constantly fidgets is going to encourage the citizen to either run or fight heres why in that moment where you have a cop with gun pointed at a zen the cop is the threat no matter if the the zen is completely innocent you understand his lizard brain is already in control he could die this is serious now if the threat moves your brain is going to tell you to react if the threat stays still your brain is likely to wait to see what the threat does so it can react accordingly so what happens when a cop fidgets the zens brain is already caught in this loop of runfightnoofightnorunno all that movement just encourages the brain to subconsciously choose for you and simply act bypassing your active suppression so many of these encounters could be solved and avoided with basic psychology actually preparing them for what theyre up against is that it should be hard to do it shouldnt be this easy to be the arm of the law i know it isnt like applying to taco bell but it should be almost as rigorous as med school in my opinion which is a sight harder than it is now just institute it grandfather in cops with a certain amount of experience allow current cops without enough experience to keep jobs but attended one class per semester allow cops for next four years to get jobs but only if they attend classes first crop of degree cops come up now require a degree always  poke holes in my 4year degree specifically designed for cops idea not just any degree but one required for cops cmv  ,1,381,2175,65,0.06153846153846154
cmv cyclists should have more personal responsibility for their safety than pedestrians,post inspired by a cyclist almost committing suicide with my car which is the circumstance i will use as an example here live in an area with a moderate number of cyclists usually see onetwo per day give or take during my short commute tofrom work im all for sharing the road and for drivers taking into consideration the fact that cyclists are hilariously unarmored in comparison to anyone in basically any motor vehicle the main area i diverge from agreeing with local laws is at the intersection of cyclists and pedestrians where i live cyclists in crosswalks have all the rights of pedestrians in them im even generally okay with this except that cyclists are both faster and have less control over their speed than pedestrians and i think the onus should be on them to account for this of what happened on my way home from work the other day have to make a left turn at a threeway intersection im coming from the odd direction which involves crossing a frequently used crosswalk i pull into the intersection stop wait for pedestrians to clear out then start making my turn cyclist is riding at speed on the sidewalk in front of me makes no indication hes going to do anything but keep riding then at the last second leans in and enters the crosswalk still at a decent cruising speed luckily i was paying attention and able to barely stop my car before hitting him or being hit by him but honestly it was close enough that im not going to pretend it couldnt have gone differently if any number of small factors were changed due to the fact that he was in a crosswalk with a walk sign there is almost no chance i would not have been found at fault for hitting him in this scenario not to mention the whole having to live with myself after flattening a person thing think that requiring cyclists to stop or at least slow down to subwalking speed before entering crosswalks to obtain pedestrian status and otherwise be treated as vehicles crossing a roadway without right of way would at least resolve the issue from the motorist side of things but i can also see how this is not a simple clearcut solution with no unwanted side effects summary cyclists bearing no responsibility for entering crosswalks safely is ridiculous due to how much faster they move than actual pedestrians it would probably be better if they were required to stop and ideally apply all other common sense about crossing a road before doing so regardless of the ideal solution the way this currently works in some places at least is unnecessarily dangerous for both cyclists and motorists a number of people have brought up the poor biking infrastructure in the us as deserving some of the blame in this situation i think said infrastructure should be made way better but this is a separate issue that doesnt apply here to be more clear i dont think there should exist anywhere places where cyclists are legally allowed to enter crosswalks at speeds exceeding that of a pedestrian 4 mph is apparently the rule in some places getting off of ones bike and walking it is the rule in others without being treated as motor vehicles in regards to fault right of way etc,1,563,3264,88,0.045454545454545456
cmv virginity is a pointless term and we should stop using it,in the past there was no such thing as a male virginity at all and the term virgin was applied to women only to suggest unspoiled goods good start the term makes no sense what constitutes virginity piv sex then gay people stay virgins for life any sexual experience bj anal and even making out are sexual experiences a woman who had her hymen torn is not a virgin what about women who had their hymen torn due to excercise or any other cause or women who had no hymen to begin with out of about 8 girlfriends i asked only one had blood during her first intercourse dis that technically makes them virgins or not virgins before that had their first sex there is a simple definition you can describe a virgin is someone who didnt have sex but again blowjob is technically sex but people dont call giving or receiving blowjobs loosing ones virginity as i said previously a lesbian woman who had a lot of lesbian sex without using a dildo is technically a virgin then do we really need this term at all thats my first point  that virginity is a blurred term and shouldnt be used in modern times because implications of this term are pretty much harmful its used to shame and judge both men and women although for opposite reasons its simply incorrect you can be a woman with hymen and not be a virgin you can be a man who never had his dick in somebody and not be a virgin yeah change my view to clarify i have two points 1 the term virginity doesnt make sense anymore 2 this term is harmful to men and women and we should stop using it i agree that banning words from dictionary makes little sense but society evolves and so does the language i changed my view in terms that banning words is a bad idea but i still think we need to change the usage of the word and update its meaning despite what some people wrote there is no actual consensus it what the word means so its pretty individual i would agree with the definition of a virgin is someone who didnt have any consensual sex not just penetrative or piv sex its debatable but  thats my opinion i dont think a christian woman who had anal only is a virgin nor is a gay guy who only received blowjobs i think a rape victim is a virgin if they had no consensual sex before also and its a topic for a totally different discussion and im not answering any messages in the matter but in my opinion rape and sex should never go together and stop giving me dictionary definitions i know perfectly what a word sex and rape mean but words and language are used to navigate through life and equating rape with sex is — trigger warning im going to say the word problematic — problematic there is literally nothing in common between a violated person and someone who just had their first sexual experience and no amount of online dictionaries will change that  least we should stop using virgin as an insult and call out those who do i remember the time when gay was used as an insult  no im not a male or a virgin and if you call me one then you just prove my point just think of what it tells about you and society if you consider a virgin an insult and yes i also contributed to the problem calling men virgins as an insult and i think its not okay it hurts both men and women ,1,621,3392,62,0.04838709677419355

cmv in tournament based sports teams should compete for true second,lets say there are four teams in the semifinals of a tournament team a team b team c and team d a plays c and b plays d if d and c lose they play for third while a and b play for first lets say b and d lose typically meaning that a got first b got second c got third and dgot fourth however both team b and team c are 11 both having beaten team d and having lost to team a there is no difference in the games they played and the results they had the only reason b got second over c is that b played d first while c had to play a in my eyes these two teams should play an additional match for true second especially in tournaments with lots of monetary implications based on placement why is this not standard do people ignore the arbitrarity nature of giving second to the team that got to face the weakest team in the first game rather than the second game typo 2 my view has been changed to the point where i believe that a single elimination bracket should be used if you just want to determine the winner as quickly as possible whereas a double elimination bracket should be used to determine rankings within a pool i also learned about the existence of the double elimination bracket thanks everyone,1,237,1250,71,0.056338028169014086
cmv the short form for the date should be written as yyyymmdd,"if you really want to avoid confusion write it out ie november 29th 2019 but for short form 20191129 makes the most sense you can easily sort the dates and compare them it follows a logically format of longest to shortest and having the 4 digits in the year avoids any confusion as to which centurymillennium it refers to it as we say it doesnt make sense as people say the date differently such as saying the 29th of november 2019 29112019 or november 29th 2019 11292019 should be the standard around the world so if i see 20190109 i know automatically it means january 9th 2019 and dont need to worry it could be september 1st 2019 hyphens do make more sense then slashes as you cannot save a computer file with slashes and does conform to the iso 8601 standard  i have changed my view that whether writing or digital we should use the hyphen so we  are consistent in all formats
2 many have  argued for day month year i acknowledge that many places and countries use day month year and that is one argument for that format to be the standard i do not however agree with the argument that is should be that way because we care more about which day it is over the year and so thats why it is first to read  one can easily read it at the end of the string of numbers and sorting becomes more problematic when its not year month day  one can also easily drop the year at the start if they only care about the month and day 1129 instead of 20191129 but even then i would still argue to include the year for consistency sake or simply write it out in words november 29th
3 some have said computers can automatically tell what the date is no matter which format but that doesnt hold true when the year month and day are under 12 010203 or even 01022003 the computer has to guess",1,342,1864,64,0.1875

cmv telling any demographic to stop doing awful things is pointless,all the gillete ad controversy has got me thinking of my young life i had been afraid of flirting with asking out and sometimes even interacting with women that i am interested in was raised to respect women and my understanding of how to respect women was just to not interact with them at all because it was too difficult for me to understand what to do and what not to do edit for clarification i am talking about my younger years here i dont still have these problems guys that do not respect women arent going to give a shit about what gillete or any ad has to say about being a decent human my view to be changed is that telling everyone to stop doing something wrong results in the wrongdoers to continue doing what is wrong and everyone else at risk of getting social anxiety because they want to be better but they were already doing fine so they withdraw themselves from social situations to avoid fucking it up because of the supposed problem hope i am wrong,1,181,1016,68,0.058823529411764705

cmv magnatelevel businesspeople such as bezos gates and zuckerberg are far more lucky than they are talented,"enormously wealthy business people are usually intelligent and talented in a narrow area of expertise  they are not however meaningfully smarter or more capable than anyone else  what they are is incredibly lucky and enjoy the knockon effects of the unique opportunities presented by previous successes factors such as timing 
 previous relationships
 previous experience 
 wealth
 social class
 luck of how all these come together
  
are greater influencers on their level of success than innate individual capability  we tend to attribute greater agency to them in their accomplishments than we should because we don’t account for the interplay of these factors  particular two attributes wealth and relationships have the greatest knockon effects for them those with financial means and powerful relationships can achieve higher orders of magnitude of impacts  paying continuing and gigantic financial dividends for a very long time i think we give these individuals altogether too much credit and attention for something that while incredibly hard was every bit as attributable to luck as it was to their hard work   not saying they
 don’t work hard 
 didn’t make good choices 
 don’t have skills
 are undeserving of professional success
 are not unique am also not saying anything about other types of people with professional success eg athletes scientists inventors actors doctors et cetera  i am saying that there are millions of people exactly like them in all key respects except onetwo luck and it’s knockon effects therefore we shouldn’t mystify or study these people’s success or habits it would be like studying the behavior of people who get hit by asteroids to learn something about how to get hit by asteroids ",1,285,1794,115,0.05217391304347826

cmv there should exist a system to ensure politicians admit to their blatant lies,tldr at bottom is cmv so i understand that what im proposing may not be perfect i also know that i am taking an idealistic view in implementing the ideas i have below but i think that some democracies have the capacity to implement this and the assumptions made here are a close representation of reality in some countries news is a problem wouldnt it be nice if politicians were legally required to admit to their blatant lies when i say blatant lies im talking about the lies that are inexcusable im talking about lies that are statistically proven to be false lies that serve to push a personal agenda and lies that have the potential to disrupt the country or government instance if a politician says that he has two children when he has one he will not be charged as it does not disrupt the country if he says that he will implement a proposal within a year but does not do so he will also not be charged such acts will constitute a broken promise rather than a blatant lie course the community that decides on what is a blatant lie may be biased there should exist a guideline the bolded points above might be a good way to start but in reality there is no unbiased institution however i believe that it is certainly possible to construct such a mostly impartial community to facilitate its aims this communitys job is simple to scour databases or news to prove or disprove the claims made by politicians nothing else in reality most of their work could be replaced by bots you can thus see why bias is only a minor obstacle the community has confirmed a blatant lie a notice will be sent to the politician asking himher to retract his statement there will be requirements on how this should be done ideally im thinking of a short address published somewhere  on 25th june i mentioned xxxx i hereby retract that statement as it is false that would be all the whole process should take less than five minutes lies must be retracted within a stipulated time period and a politician can retract multiple lies at one go the reason for this is to ensure that a politician is not overburdened should heshe be a obsessive liar he fails to retract his lie he will simply be removed from his current position even if he is somehow the president we live in a free country after all so there will be no arrests this system will be effective though it covers only certain types of blatant lies it holds politicians accountable for the things they say there will be trickle over effects for our democracy as well every grand promise a politician makes is based on something and if this something is false we shouldnt be entertaining them at all getting politicians to admit to their lies basically invalidates perceived problems that do not need fixing we can finally get on to the real things to improve the maturity of our political discussion and put partisan politics aside not only that forcing politicians to admit to their lies basically embarrasses them and it allows the electorate to distinguish between trustworthy and untrustworthy candidates the unlikely event that a politician has to lie to keep the public safe he can make an appeal to the courts if this appeal is approved by the courts he will not be required to retract his statement however once the crisis is over he will have to confess to the public the truth it is our current system is not comprehensive enough we must make it such that politicians who are obsessive liars are unable to avoid the consequences of their lies kind of system is troublesome and embarrassing only to politicians who are obsessive liars it is a small price to pay to maintain the sanity of our democracy a community will decide if a politicians lies are blatant or serious enough to warrant retraction if they find such a lie politicians are legally required to take back their false claims or they will be removed from office simple as that thanks for your helpful replies i understand that such a system may be overly harsh perhaps some sort of edits might be required however i believe it is still a direction worth exploring i have to sleep now will reply to your comments when i wake up,1,747,4375,83,0.04819277108433735

cmv ceo salaries should be tied to the wage of their lowest paid worker,something that is often attributed to the success of the modern company and economic growth generally is the tying of ceo salaries to the stocks of their respective companies this provides a powerful incentive to a ceo to increase the value of their company as itll improve their stock the downside of this is that it creates a massive wealth gap and enforces poor wage for lowskill workers with ceos making in some cases over 1000x minimum wage therefore i think that as well as being tied to stock ceo salary should also be tied to the wages of their lowest paid workers,1,103,584,72,0.08333333333333333
cmv girlsonly math and science competitions are counterproductive and do not help to encourage more girls into these fields,currently math and science tend to be much more maledominated than other fields and this seems to be the case in mathscience competitions as well competitions like the international mathematical olympiad imo are usually disproportionately male dominated to the extent that one or two girls on a countrys team is enough to make the news to encourage more girls to enter competitions like this and to encourage interest in stem there are some competitions like the egmo european girls mathematical olympiad that are open only to girls  find this counterproductive because i dont see the reason why creating a competition only for girls will actually help encourage them into math and science separating by gender can give people the incorrect impression that girls are less able than boys in these fields and therefore require a separate competition to get anywhere at all only reason i can think of for why a separate competition needs to be created for different genders is when significant physical differences would make a combined competition unfair which is why physical sports are separated by gender but in academic fields like math and science i dont see any biological reason why someone with xx chromosomes should be predisposed to be worse in stem addition since the population is close to half and half male and female a competition limited to one gender would probably mean less people take part  so the fact that there are fewer people in the female only competition will mean that standards are lower overall just because there are fewer people in the competition  like if you take the fastest person in a large city and a small village the fastest person from the city is statistically more likely to be faster than the village person because there are more people in the city so the probability is higher  may mean that the girls only competition may be perceived as secondrate or at a lower standard and wrongly stigmatise girls as being less able in math even though it isnt the case which is counterproductive to the original intention,1,351,2129,126,0.031746031746031744
cmv a biological woman should not be forced to give a brazilian bikini wax to a trans woman male genitalia,"the following is a quote from an article i pasted below you haven’t heard a month or so ago a brazilian immigrant to canada has been forced to shut down her body waxing business after she refused to wax the male genitals of a transgender activist jessica yaniv formerly known as jonathan yaniv is a biological male who identifies as a woman  post millennial reports that yaniv filed a complaint with the british columbia human rights tribunal last year after marcia da silva refused to wax him yaniv argued that the mother of two discriminated against him on the basis of sex and he is now demanding financial restitution  silva who operated her business out of her own home said she refused to serve yaniv due to safety concerns and alleged harassment from him not because he is transgender  silva told the tribunal during last weeks proceedings that the ordeal has forced her to shut down her business and it is not longer a source of income for her family  isnt the only one who has been targeted by yaniv the transgender activist also filed complaints against 15 other british columbian estheticians for refusing to wax his genitalia” read the articles below for more of the backstory   is my argument  biological female should not have to put her hands near or on a biological male’s penis regardless she shouldn’t have to do it because it’s her business and if she is only comfortable with touching women with biological women’s parts then that is where the line is drawn she shouldn’t have litigation brought against her as it is a waste of her time and resources she has any religious ethical situational or moral right to say no end of story  following is an added edit after debating with people here above wording focuses on one gender or sex vs another gender or sexthe above is true but it only applies to one angle i don’t want to delete anything i’ve written in this op as it wouldn’t be right so i don’t view this as a trans rights issue i view it as a consent issue  better statement and argument is  touching genitals there must always be consent  no matter what the circumstances in any case anywhere  you try to force or coerce anyone to touch anyone’s genitals for any reason it is like a sexual assault   there can be one circumstance if someone is having a medical issue a doctor or medical professional can touch their genitals without consent from usa so i don’t believe that we have the same protected class laws so maybe someone from canada or anyone will give me reason to change my mind

cmv affirmative action is bad policy even from a progressivesjw perspective,"generally arguments against affirmative action are levied from a conservative sometimes racist perspective those against aa generally deny the existence of systemic racism or historical injustice against black people in the united states opponents of aa also tend to look down upon its recipients believing that they dont deserve it would consider myself a progressive i acknowledge that historical injustice and systemic racism exist however i am still against aa as a policy for two main reasons 1 it doesnt use progressive values to approach social justice and 2 there is insufficient evidence that it is effective policy action isnt progressive two foundational progressive ideas are that race is a social construct and social justice should be viewed through an intersectional lens keeping these two ideas in mind aa is not a very progressive policy
 race is a social construct that is the most scientific way to look at it even from a less academic more practical standpoint it makes more sense to view race as a social construct some black people look hispanic some hispanics look black other hispanics look white indians can look hispanic or black depending on the season the fact that we lump east asians and indians into the category of asian despite them looking nothing alike or having little to no cultural similarities should make you question the way we view race in america at one point in american history irish and italian immigrants werent considered white and were called white nwords so even the category of white isnt fixed
 if you accept this premise that race is a social construct then racebased aa becomes very complicated it becomes very difficult to gauge who deserves aa why do hispanics who look white receive aa when indians that look black do not what about mixed race children indians irishmen italians ethnic jews chinese and japanese—while they werent enslaved like black people—faced massive discrimination historically and in some cases are still victims of discrimination today yet these groups dont benefit from aa at all
 intersectionality is the idea that social categories such as race class and gender are interconnected and combine to create unique levels of discrimination and privilege this further complicates the role of aa why should white women benefit the most from aa should nigerian immigrants who are arguably the most successful ethnic group in the us and whose ancestors have not been victims of slavery in america benefit from aa it could also be argued that it is unfair not to consider class why should a white female student coming from an affluent family receive aa over a white male student coming from a destitute family what about transgender students should a trans male receive aa because he is trans or because he wasis biologically female or should he be seen as having male privilege action is not effective the stated goal of aa is to address racial inequality by providing opportunities to marginalized groups that have been squandered by historically racism andor current systemic racism i dont believe there is sufficient evidence to suggest that aa is effective policy for achieving that goal one of the most comprehensive studies on aa concludes that its efficiency is ambiguous at best and the redistributive effects may not be large given that aa has been around for over 50 years and its effects are ambiguous at best i feel like it is safe to say it is not effective
 an analysis of 45 studies on aa suggests that it can perpetuate negative stigmas so not only is aa not very effective it can also be harmful i see aa as trying to use a bandaid to patch a severe laceration it may or may not help but there are more effective ways to deal with the issue of social injustice also implementing aa without committing social injustice in the process seems very complicated when considering intersectionality and the socially constructed nature of race solutions imo end the war on drugs blacks use and sell drugs at similar rates as whites but are 65 times as likely to be incarcerated for drugrelated crimes ending the drug war could end the mass incarceration of black and brown men in america being raised in a singleparent household is associated with more juvenile crime worse educational outcomes behavioral and emotional issues etc less incarceration could mean more intact families and better outcomes for black and brown children
 improve access to abortion and contraceptives this can also help combat teenage pregnancies and reduce singleparent households
 dont fund schools from property taxes poorer often black neighborhoods levy less property taxes which leads to underfunded schools education should be the great equalizer but this system amplifies inequality between the rich and the poor
 i believe these solutions unlike aa are closer to targeting the root causes of the racial inequality in america today that being said i am not a policy expert these are just some of the many potential solutions",1,828,6010,80,0.1

cmv male victims of rape should not be required to pay child support to their female perpetrators if she gets pregnant,"i thought this would be an uncontroversial issue but after seeing the flood of downvotes on this comment in an askreddit discussion in context i guess its not who are raped by women in my opinion should definitely not be legally required to pay child support to the woman if she gets pregnant i believe that in any case of rape the perpetrator should be responsible for all the consequences of his or her actions when a person is raped he or she has been violated in just about the worst way possible to force a man to pay child support to the person who abused him would simply be straight up theft in addition to having been raped although the presence of a child does create a need for resources i think the last person this responsibility should fall on is the person who has already been violated so horribly to me taking a persons money after he or she has been a victim of crime is the most unjust possible thing that can be done in that situation so thanks to this post a ton of people have been sent over to the comment and its now been hit with a flood of upvotes the original downvotes can no longer be seen however at the time this post was made the comment was sitting at 48 this is the downvote flood that is now no longer visible

cmv theres no consistent argument against incest,"incest is probably the most widely spread taboo in human culture but i find all the argument against it to be inconsistent
 incest produces offspring with disabilities this one is only partially true incest itself doesnt increase the chances of genetic disorders and everyone that remembers gregor mendels studies should know that but beside this incest is a sexual activity between closely related individuals so it doesnt really require procreation as it comprehends non reproductive activities such as oral sex and anal sex as well as safe sex to avoid unwanted pregnancies banning the sexual intercourse to prevent the pregnancy seems excessive to me also if the two individuals are homosexual the problem of a pregnancy is non existent another counter argument could be if we prohibit incest to prevent the birth of a child with genetic disorders does that mean that we should also forbid people who have genetic disorders or carry a recessive gene that may cause a disorder to reproduce
 incest is abuserapepedophilia i get this because the majority of reported cases of incest usually involve an older relative that violates a younger one eg a father and his daughter or a brother and a younger sister but i think that this argument misses the point the thing that makes these sexual acts immoral and punishable is not the fact that they involve two close relatives but the fact that they are nonconsensual andor feature an adult having sex with a minor a consensual intercourse between two adults is not harmful
 incest is disgusting this is probably the argument that i understand the most but also the most fallacious one nothing can be considered inherently wrong just because its considered disgusting by ones subjective views its not wrong to eat garlic bread with strawberry jam  even though many people including me would consider it disgusting i do not support inbreeding even though the ambiguity of my post made it unclear people can engage in sexual activity without the purpose of procreation and if done correctly the risk of an unwanted pregnancy is really low so i ask you to stop using the it causes genetic defects in children argument because a guy having sex with his own sister is different from a guy having a child with his own sister i have no problem with the former i have many with the latter",1,397,2444,50,0.08

cmv you cant deradicalize people you dont talk to,"i have a hypothesis  moderation contributes to radicalization through the formation of echo chambers  is bigger than reddit though id like you to keep that in mind  need to define content moderation view is that content moderation is removal by a human or automated system of something posted online typical example of this is a reddit comment another example is a youtube video  whats the problem right doesnt seem like there is a problem at a quick glance  who get banned in most cases are people who break the rules of a community ya  so they broke rules lets work with that as the baseline of truth  the rules written in such a way that ensured some groups would break the rules at a disproportionate rate example you can write a law that says nobody can drive on the highway after midnight so everyone who commutes by that highway after midnight is breaking that rule one of your rules is that nobody can post pictures of cats if you ban everyone who posts a picture of a cat you have created two echo chambers is full of people who do not post pictures of cats the second is people who do post pictures of cats
 two groups i believe either become stagnant in their beliefs or overtime strengthen those beliefs becoming in this scenario a person who posts cats 247  opportunity cost is paid  neither group can add anyone to their team from the other team because neither team is in the same room  second opportunity cost is paid  people from group a do not know how to effectively debate people from group b and the opposite is true as well  believe that people are not static in their ideals i believe that every conversation moves us in one direction or another by imperceptible distance someone may change you a lot that is rare though someone can change you 1 of the time almost 100 of the time either in their direction or further in yours  such if the only people you talk to are people who are either at your point on the number line or further down in the direction that youre already headed you can truly only go one way with a few exceptions like if you reach the end of the number line and find out that your ideas were based on incorrect information at that point youre the only one that can change you  continue the cat metaphor from above  people may say that people who post cats are bad people and therefore its entirely justified to ban them  opportunity cost is paid  when you ban somebody who posts cats posting cats may be 1 of their entire behavior you have now just banned 99 of their behavior on the back of 1 of it  have thrown the baby out with the bathwater and in doing so created two echo chambers where neither side can talk do not mean to imply that content moderation is 100 of radicalization it may be as low as 1 but i do believe it hurts more than helps 
 phrase comes from a tv show sure but we only make peace with our enemies right  literally the worst thing ever

 lol jki cant make this tldr sorry
 id like to add something else i should have from the start i believe that we have an obligation to be good neighbors

 i believe that if we just ship the problem elsewhere we are doing more harm than good because often we are spreading the pathogen to several other entities aside our own

 as well since we may participate in those other entities at a lower rate than we do the original entity we have also just shot ourselves in the foot a bit lol because we cleaned out this pool and dumped it all into our hot tub been told in the past the way to conduct a scientific experiment is to try everything in the world to disprove your hypothesis  crowdsourced that labor from you guys  nobody as of yet on 81119 at 4 am my time has moved me in such a way that i feel this hypothesis is disproven im actually a little bit sad about that because if this is true i think its going to have some very negative outcomes for us all lol trend is not moving towards talking to each other the trend is moving further and further into echo chambers  4 am ive got to get some sleep you guys are lovely ill check back in eventually",1,787,4422,53,0.07547169811320754

cmv there isn’t a good reason to use pronouns outside of traditional masculine feminine and gender neutral options,"with respect to the gender identity movement and those who struggle with their gender i regularly use and accept when someone wants to be referred to by specific pronouns i accept that there are those who don’t identify or align with their birth sex and their mental identification more closely aligns with the opposite sex instead if someone was born a man but identifies as a woman i have no qualms referring to them as she her etc likewise for those who are born female but identify as men i’ll refer to them as he him etc what i’m struggling with is how it has evolved to a point where pronouns have escaped the traditional masculine feminine or gender neutral options and what purpose the growing list options support 
 are examples that i’ve come across from the lgbtq resource center from  i’m sure there are plenty of other resources for the growing list of gender pronouns but this seems like a good starting point for my view language is diverse and i know that it changes over time we have many words that mean the same thing or clarify subtle changes between definitions heherhishers differentiates between masculine and feminine theythemwe is used in neutral ways and the traditional extensions of those pronouns seemingly covers 99 of people 
 is the function of stretching pronouns even further with options such as vevisververself or zezirzirszirself if you want options that aren’t restricted by masculine or feminine classification we already have gender neutral pronouns such as theythemtheirsthemself which accomplishes the same thing to my understanding why do we need additional more specific options when in typical conversation masculine feminine or neutral pronouns cover the overwhelming majority of people what purpose do these ever changing pronouns offer past confusion and divide and what problem do these new options solve  
 would change my view an example where existing masculine feminine or gender neutral pronouns don’t accurately describe a group of people but some of these new pronoun options do if you have an example what does the newer pronoun option describes that isn’t already covered by traditional options i’ve listed 
 not restricted to the newer pronouns i’ve linked in this post i know i’ve only listed a few but am open to hearing about other pronouns that might be more widely known that i’ve missed but you’ll need to show whyhow that pronoun describes a person better than masculine feminine or existing gender neutral options",1,415,2674,116,0.034482758620689655

 what’s this about  cmv has come a long way since its creation in january 2013 i never could’ve predicted its growth to 700000 subscribers the team of passionate moderators keeping things in check nor the many genuine connections made here every day between people willing to listen and learn from each other as the subreddit has grown weve matured and so have our ambitions  was the perfect starting point for this experiment but we feel strongly that our positive contribution to public discourse would be better served by having the freedom to forge our own path this is why in mid2018 i decided a “cmv 20” was necessary and shortly formed a founding team with alex projectwatt creator liz longtime cmv moderator and jon udeltabot developer to begin development of changeaviewcom cav  may be wondering what exactly inspired us to expand outside of a subreddit—i’ll go into detail below for those who want to better understand the original motivation behind cmv and now cav please read our mission
 user experience  moderators we don’t have much influence on how reddit works most of the time that makes sense—imagine 138000 active subreddits existing for wildly different reasons all getting their wishes when it comes to the fundamental reddit mechanics while we had concerns that the reddit redesign was favoring quickconsumption content over longform discussion and led a group that raised these in a proposal named “design for discussion which the admins engaged with us on we ultimately realized that reddit had made the necessary design choices for its needs our needs we understand are different we continue to enjoy reddit and appreciate that it afforded us an opportunity to learn and grow this period of time was undoubtedly a catalyst for pursuing our own ideas and design philosophy we’ve known for a while now that we’d have done many things differently if cmv had been built from the ground up instead of within the reddit mould for example the purpose of voting would be redefined and ranking mechanics would reflect this the delta system would be fully integrated users could filter content geographically or by category we would make dramatic moderation improvements that cascade down to the user experience and many other cmvspecific features would be added  has made this all possible and much of it has already been built but rather than continue to develop privately towards perfection we’re now ready to share this journey with you as we continue to improve the website including a feedback area dedicated to incorporating your thoughts and critiques 
 moderation experience deserves its own section reddit’s mod tools are perfectly fine for probably 99 of subreddits but we have very specific workflows and recordkeeping processes behind the scenes of cmv that use various “hacky” solutions tasks that take 7 clicks copypasting and two browser extensions for us on reddit are now completely streamlined at cav removing friction and saving moderators time ensures quality at scale this matters as any cmv contributor will know because what we do here only works if our rules and standards are consistently upheld built a public moderation log with the intention of allowing those who seek it out to verify that content removals are justified we trust our moderators but understand that transparency in this area is mutually beneficial sometimes mods may still need to redact sensitive information from the public modlog—in cases of ‘doxxing’ for example also plan to make the moderation team led by brett cmv mod ansuz07 a much more structured and valued part of the overall organisation our moderators are involved because we want them to be we think humans need to be in the loop and even though we are building partnerships to automate some moderation use cases we want people looking at difficult scenarios and setting coherent precedents for us this is a feature not a bug and why weve spent so much time developing quality moderation tools

 perspective api collaborated with jigsaw and have integrated perspective api into cav’s moderation in addition to user reports perspective is used to increase the speed of our human moderation by flagging comments that may break our rules so that moderators can review and make the final call we will continuously work to improve the efficiency and quality of cav’s moderation to keep the conversation productive and inclusive
 future plans cav isn’t just about improving what we do today but also having the capacity and autonomy to take opportunities and branch in new directions as we evolve we have big plans some of which we’ve made a start on that will require more resources than we have now to fully execute—concepts like integrating with education providing private cav areas to organizations and a widget to facilitate twoway cav discussions below external articles we also expect to eventually introduce a paid subscription on the public site for users who want some extra servicesfeatures the website isn’t monetized today but hopefully these ideas will generate the revenue necessary to make this project sustainable—we’re determined to avoid the need to display ads 
 let’s go change some views hope this announcement has been informative—as you can probably tell there’s a lot to cover here so feel free to ask questions below or at changeaviewcom and remember to get your cmv legacy badge if you qualify for one  viewchanging and thanks for reading on behalf of the cav team",1,980,6472,64,0.109375

cmv the us militarys internal justice system is actually more fair and overall better than the civilian one and wed all be better off if some version of it was applied countrywide,"just to give some background i spent 8 years active duty army and worked as a prisonerescort for a while im not a legal scholar by any stretch im just a guy who sat through a few courts martial including one for a very serious crime also means my experience is specific to the army the other branches might do things differently but im pretty sure they are all basically the same i just want to preemptively point out im not of the view that military law should be applied en masse military law and regulation is authoritarian by nature and it would be unacceptable to apply it to people that dont willingly choose to join im talking specifically about the nuts and bolts of the court system what happens when accused of a crime first off article 15
in the army its art 15 i think the marines call it nonjudicial punishment the other branches probably have some other name for it its kinda like pleading nocontest on a speeding ticket theyre usually applied when there is no real question on guilt it generally just says you did this here is a punishment  you are recieving one you have the right to take it to a lawyer and ill get more to that further down you can choose to accept the charge and the punishment if you do you dont have to go to trial everyone saves a little time and the punishments handed down by them are usually more lenient than an actual court can give  dont have to accept one you can always say that youre not guilty or you think the punishment dropping from one is too harsh and take it to court martial if youre caught deadtorights and the punishment from one isnt over the top accepting one does make life a little easier for everyone your lawyer can generally advise on if it is a good idea to take it or not
 lawyer really is free going to court martial just like in the civilian world you have the right to an attorney just like in the civilian world you can use a public defender in the army called trial defense service unlike in the civilian world or at least in many states it is not up to the court to decide if you can afford your own lawyer many states the court will basically audit your personal wealth and decide if you can afford your own attorney and tell you that you have too much to use a public defender  armys version is tds they are free period if accused of a crime they will help you there is no hourly rate you just make an appointment theyll go over your article 15 with you and advise you on it they will come defend you in court they are just as capable and dedicated as any other lawyer and no one will ever ask you to prove you cant afford a real lawyer course you can hire a regular attorney if you want but you dont have to if the court decides your net worth is above some line they made you wont have to skip meals to pay for a regular lawyer because the judge decided youre too wealthy for the public defenders office you wont have to reveal the value of your car house or jewelry
 is no such thing as bail youre accused of something serious enough to wind up in a jailsetting you will have a pretrial confinement hearing you your attorney and the prosecution sit down with a judge judge has to decide two things you be dangerous to others you likely to flee both of those are no you get cut loose pending the trial you dont have to come up with a few thousand dollars to let the court hang onto and possibly keep  can save the right to a jury i think this does exist in some states but im not completely sure the default is to have a jury but you dont have to if you choose not to the judge ultimately decides guiltinnocence and the punishment why would you give up the right to a jury it actually does make sense in some cases people on juries arent legal experts theyre people they will likely assign sentence based on emotion versus a judge who assigns what he feels satisfies the law

 the common theme above is mostly about money i feel the militarys internal courts are much more fair and unswayed by the wealth of the accused i feel like it is a much better justice system in alot of ways than the regular civilian courts where the poor are often at a hefty disadvantage

cmv news outlets should refrain from showing the names and faces of mass shooters,there is a sizable body of evidence which points to the spreading of this information as a possible catalyst for copycat events whether it is explained by the coverage planting the seed in a copycat or someone wishing to gain the fame associated with perpetrating a mass shooting it seems to me that this information has much less value to the public than would be necessary to justify its proliferation in cases where the information could help lead to capture or conviction i would understand exceptions however like in recent cases where the killer is undoubtedly at fault and is in custody i dont see a strong case for the spreading of this information while i understand an outright ban would cut against the first amendment news outlets should be pressured to voluntarily follow this guideline,1,136,814,82,0.04878048780487805

cmv minimum wage should provide enough for an individual to be self sufficient if working full time,"minimum wage should provide enough for an individual working full time which i will consider to be 35 hoursweek to meet their individual needs and have some extra for upgradingsavingrecreation social mobility 
 should be able to afford the following on minimum wage after taxes for a studio apartment for yourself for yourself for yourself for yourself including essential drugs for yourself example i will use the following figures based roughly from torontogta to illustrate my point this is after taxes
rent for studio 900 there are many studio apartments available for 800 to 1000 per month
utilities 100 this is an estimation for a studio
food 160
internetcellphone 80
transportation 250 weekly bus pass for unlimited bus use with ttc is 4375week for adults
extra 300 for savings academic upgrading social mobility etc
healthcare 0 im assuming its already covered through taxation
 total this is 1790 per month if this individual didnt have to pay taxes then at 35 hours per week and 43 weeks per month i believe that a minimum wage of 12 per hour is fair
 will not change my view
minimum wage should be enough to take care of a family have kids if youre not ready to have them is making you take care of your family

 to provide more information my belief in this matter is a compromise on the following free market supply and demand sets wages if an employee is extremely easy to replace their wage should reflect that should have some standard of living and undercutting saying you will work for much less is antiworker and is a practice that would reduce wages across the board for all workers this practice should be kept in check and a way to this while providing some quality of life is a minimum wage
 2 i am not interested in discussing how much employers should pay as in the dollar value i am here to discuss the reasoning that should be used to establish minimum wage also note that as it stands right now if minimum wage is meant to cover these expenses than it the dollar value is fine as it stands atleast in ontario which is where i live

cmv the light switch for a bathroom should be on the inside not outside the door,"main reasons if you need to enter in the middle of the night and dont want to disturb anyone you can be considerate and close the door before turning on the light especially true in an ensuite bathroom
 no one can turn the light out on you by accident or on purpose 
 if you know you need to turn on the fan i would say its less embarrassing after entering the room and waiting a little while than projecting the fact you will stink up the room open to being wrong but any light switch on the outside of a bathroom is a horrible decision but unconvincing points against its fun to turn the light out on people
 its more instinctive to turn on the light before you walk into the small room if its right next to the door frame  the switch has to be immediately adjacent to the opening of the door frame otherwise its worse addressed below based on discussion thus far id like to differentiate between a small number of bathrooms which may force builders to build outside the door very smallmulti function with shower only space very far away etc and the objective superiority of indoorswitches
 i would also accept similar to the previous point that it was more reasonable in old home however this is more an issue of what should be in the best bathroom circumstances
 the humidity issue is strong but id like evidence especially as many bathrooms always include an electrical outlet often without surge protection  mind has been changed in the case of public bathrooms from the post by rralphj but this remains a homebased discussion

cmv disney has absolutely gutted the star wars franchise,"i love star wars love the lore mainly but overall its something ive grown up with my entire life in just a few short years i have watched disney destroy the lore and my expectations for anything good for star wars my three main points
 story it is apparent that whomever is in charge of star wars does not care about its characters or the direction of the series blatant destruction of story arks in episode 8 literally rehashing a new hope for episode 7 and bringing back popular characters just to generate interest because their boring story cant carry weight my point  what is the new trilogy even about rey her parents were no one saving the galaxy  we havent even seen the new republic from episode 6 theres no stakes the new characters finn and his ridiculous obsession with rey for no reason and the love story from no where with no build up its bs
 the games i like video games but the recent games from disney are obvious cash grabs with no merit the literal exact same game from 2005 had more content in it screw the graphics give me actual good game play
 no direction from all the stories games and merch disney is pushing there is no rhyme or reason no direction for where the franchise is going i dont know what to expect or what to be excited about the answer is nothing
 point disney has gutted and made hollow something i love please change my mind please reddit youre my only hope",1,262,1463,58,0.10344827586206896

cmv in christianity and all its denominations the bible portrays god as immoral and unrighteous and preistspastors who try to explain otherwise only give weak and fallible arguments,"i am a roman catholicish i went to a private catholic high school for some time i received first communion when i was seven and confirmation when i was six and previously went to bible school every saturday night to learn about the bible and mass i dont necessarily believe in the god that has been presented towards me in fact i dare say i dont know what i believe in as of currently however my belief in god does not change the argument that has been laid down now that the exposition of who i am is out of the way let me explain my position  off i am not attacking the christian church nor its practices though i do have strong feelings towards american christianity in specific this claim is only  referring to the holy bible itself i could even extend this argument to judaism and islam as they all share the same beliefs of the old testament at least generally  where the majority of my argument will reside  want to get out of the way a few counter arguments that i will not find acceptable arguments that priests have given me in the past god is a nonhuman being therefore does not need to practice human morals is a claim that god is a higher being then humans themselves that he is one that humans cannot begin to comprehend one that is in a completely separate category then humans are and therefore because he is higher then us it is his right to treat us accordingly to his will if it is true that god created humans and also created the moral laws in which humans need to abide by then by humans standards if god breaks the moral code then he is being not only immoral but hypocritical and the hypocrisy factor is what adds the second layer to why god breaking his own law is morally impermissible any arguments that say god is always right because he is omniscient or anything similar is a logically circular argument and is question begging  when god is seemingly mistreating you it is simply a test of your faith  is a claim that states that god never really has any negative intentions in any thing that he directly or indirectly does but he instead is testing your will and faith towards him by discomforting the human testing faith is not something to be done with pain and if faith is tested via harming or causing the other person discomfort or pain then it is immoral because it uses the person only as a means to your personal ends kantian bias if when in a relationship one of the partners decides to test their significant others faith by pretending to cheat on them or trying to get them to cheat on you via seduction it is immoral so why is god morally allowed to harm humans to test their faith and my answer is that it is not god is right morally permissible even when he is wrong a logical standpoint this makes no sense and is flat out wrong in a black and white standpoint something cannot be true while it is also false however i will entertain the idea that the meaning is more of something is right even when it seems to be wrong which is a logically acceptable statement my counter argument for this is an argument that is not very strong however i find it stronger then the initial argument of gods rightness itself and that is that we as humans even under god have the right to have a collective subjective opinion towards what is right and wrong and this why we study ethics and because god claims to give us free will though this also disputed and we have the right to believe in a human subjective opinion therefore we can obviously distinguish what decisions are and are not morally permissible even at a godly level  that was not the point of the story of how the story ends or what the story means i want to claim that god acted immoral in some way or another to receive some sort of teaching by the end of the story regardless of how the story played out i believe that some of his actions are  in one way or another  morally impermissible therefore the moral of the story plays no effect in my argument  to my main argument which is that the bible portrays god as immoral for this im not going to cite specific quotes as the translations and differences in religionsdenominations all slightly vary instead i want to allude to some of the bibles stories itself i also want to point out that  the story of abraham and isaac this test of faith story goes that god asked abraham to sacrifice his son isaac in order to prove this faith to god now many religions have extremely different interpretations on gods intentions of the sacrifice but i will not go that far into the story as to share its moral the story ends by god or an angel stopping abraham from killing isaac and offering up a ram instead  gave humans a rule specifically to not kill anyone however it is apparently morally permissible to break this rule iff god himself gave the divine command to do so this in itself is not only hypocritical but also morally impermissible by gods and humans rulings god had no reason to ask for the attempted murder of one of his children there are other more righteous ways in which god could have handled abrahams faith other then asking for the murder of his son regardless of what his intentions are to asking the task the story of job is a story that i bring up a lot and get the that was not the point of the story argument job was a man who had faith in god and lived a good and wealthy life with many kids and was in prosperity to test his faith god made a deal with the devil be it was apparently the devils idea rather then gods but i dont see as to why that matters that the devil may do anything he wanted to job in evil to test his faith to god whatever the devil does it cannot kill job himself  ends up happening is job losing everything his family was killed farm brutalized and his wealth evaporated but in the end of the story job gets everything back because he stayed faithful to god through hardships  reason i find this morally impermissible is that god was the one who indirectly caused these hardships again with testing faith god made the decision that he will serious f up one of his followers lives for the pure reason of seeing his reaction towards it another step is the question of if job hadnt stayed faithful to god would god have punished him even more for well for being punished by god god used his follower his child as a means to his personal end game in a deal with the devil which is morally impermissible contradictions in the bible is not a specific story this time but contradictions of different points from around the bible to set up this argument i want to make it clear the belief that god has complete control over humans meaning that he has the ability to affect their lives by either creating them in a certain way or affecting a certain condition  the discrimination against other religions  if god indeed created each child and had control over humans in the first place why birth any children to other religions why let humans tickle the possibility of other fake gods if god is to do this and allow this then he must also not discriminate over the belief of false gods as he was the one who had complete control of the creation and the spreading of these religions 
2 the discrimination of other humans  homosexuality disputed women and those born with lesser then others or in unfortunate circumstances a leper should not be treated differently by god nor judged differently as he created them 
3 thou shalt love tho neighbor as thyself except when x y z disclaimer this is only for christianity as it is only portrayed in the new testament not my strongest argument as it derives sources from both the old and new testament but the main argument is that god tells to always love your neighbor however commonly contradicts in saying that others are okay not to love  list of noncomprehensive argumentsexamples for the sake of time god wiping the world void from moses though he does feel remorse for this action
 god punishing eve even though he knew that eve had the capacity to sin as he had created her

cmv the current discourse surrounding pedophilia and viewing it as synonymous with child molestation is counterproductive and cause for otherwise preventable sexual offences,disclaimer 0 because apparently this hasnt been stressed enough i dont want to give pedophiles child pornography i dont want more pedophiles around children i dont want to make child molestation legal i dont want therapies that teach pedophiles that its okay to act on urges i want a cultural climate in which the existence of pedophilia as a sexual desire is recongnized and distinguished from the act of child molestation for the purpose of them feeling safe enough to voluntarily and without fear of repercusions seek treatment that focuses on supressing desires and avoiding riskful situations and behaviours before they become offenders again hope that clears things up 1 i’m not a pedophile but interested inadvocating for a more effective way to protect children i’ve been in a happy relationship with an adult woman for several years now and never have viewed a child as anything other than i child i only bring this up because there seem some people who will immediately jump to conclusions as i’ve experienced as it seems uncommon to use throwaways on here i will conform and use my regular profile trusting the reddit community to take my words at face value 2 i’m not arguing for something like discussed during the sexual revolution in the 60s where there were proposals to decriminalize or legalize sex with children it is thoroughly wrong in my opinion and i’m 100 for criminalizing child molestation and child abuse to anyone who experienced this i’m deeply sorry for what you had to go through and i wholeheartedly understand if you’re disgusted by my position is a sexual preference not consciously decided on or easily suppressed without treatment and professional help the understandable stigmatizing of pedophilia leads to fear of pedophiles outing themselves and seeking effective help simultaneously it prevents policy makers to supply funds for the research and implementation for effective therapies as it would seem weak on or sympathizing with pedophiles bring this up because of a post yesterday in which i’ve advocated for something similar – though not as explicit as here – and faced a lot of negative reactions my goal is in the best scenario to see if i’m missing some benefit of the tabooing and shaming of pedophilic tendencies and change my view accordingly or – at least – to find an underlying rational that would oppose my view on a different level than an emotional one talking about pedophilia and pedophiles in a medical sense here not following the common usage of the word as synonymous with child molester this means anyone who feels sexually attracted to prepubescent children i’m diverging from the common medical definition in the sense that i’m also including people attracted to adolescents during puberty because it applies similarly and is in my opinion something that should be prevented of outing themselves preventing treatment our current climate i think it’s far to stigmatized to out yourself as a pedophile even for the purpose of getting therapy most people will react understandably disgusted when someone tells them he has pedophilic tendencies this is problematic in the sense that a lot of pedophiles are deeply disgusted with their preferences themselves this article goes into a bit more detail about the whole situation detailing the depression and suicidal thoughts faced by many pedophiles furthermore it explains that a lot of pedophiles don’t want to commit the atrocity they are attracted to but given the climate a lot of them will be too frightened to talk to their loved ones gp or a specialist because of fear of getting judged regardless if they molested a child already or only have difficulties suppressing their urge to problem with that is that – i think – being continuously depicted as monstrous sexual offenders by society and internalizing that self view might actually decrease the threshold to become an offender if everyone including you already thinks you’re more monster than men why not just give in to it the other side we have programs like “don’t offend” spearheaded by the charité university hospital in berlin the program has been widely praised in the field and by participiants as evident by their review section the options range from everything starting with group therapy to chemical castration if sought after by the pedophile and will help the partaking individuals to find the best ways on how to get ahead of their preferences and not wanting to satisfy their urges sadly they have to invest a massive amount of resources in raising awareness and securing the anonymity of participants fear of being somehow outed or only picking up leaflets somewhere will still cause that a lot of people – who would benefit from the program and not be as likely to become an offender – will never go there despite the track record and i can blame them british man was so desperate he moved to germany to be able to access a dunkelfeld programme in an email exchange with the guardian the man who wished to remain anonymous wrote “so far all i have ever received from the nhs is doors slammed in my face “despite paedophilia being listed as a mental illness in the dsm the standard classification of mental disorders they don’t want to help you they just want to see you locked up or perhaps even burnt at the stake i am so sick and tired of uk medical ‘professionals’ looking at me as if i’ve grown horns and a barbed tail” guardian and policymakers cant support therapy programs actually brings me to my second point policy makers fearing to back programs like this out of fear of being labeled to sympathize with sex offenders there is an effective therapy that will lead to keeping children safe but as it focuses on preventing offenders from offending instead of the victims it faces an uphill battle like that are unlikely to get implemented because the regulations for keeping the identities of pedophiles in therapy isn’t possible in a lot of countries in many countries they couldn’t even be effectively be therapized because if they already became an offender and not want to offend again the couldn’t be open about what they’ve done which is necessary for therapy because the psychologist would legally be required to alert the police changes in these laws seem unlikely because of the optics it would’ve if a politican proposed something like that goes for the funding of these projects or research in that area gladly that program in berlin is backed by the german administration but as far as my experience goes most people voting for that administration don’t know that the cduspd supports this in their program and will be offended or downright angry because of it this is only possible because of a consensus to keep quite about this by politicians of all over the spectrum and the media however if i imagine something like this in the us i just cant picture a world where fox news wouldn’t call for the heads of the party writing something like this in their official agenda change my view typos 2 disclaimer 0 sorry for screaming,1,1196,7640,174,0.022988505747126436

cmv there was nothing antimilitary about kaepernick’s kneeling protest,there is nothing about kap kneeling during the national anthem that could reasonably be construed as disrespect to the troops there is no situation i am aware of in any culture where the act of kneeling is used to show anything other than respect those who believe that kap hates the military are simply choosing to associate his protest with disrespect for the troops which allows them to freely hate him without having to really look at the reason for his protest  protest began as a means of drawing attention to racial inequality and police brutality two things that most people probably ought to be against by focusing on an imaginary link between the protest and the sacred cow of “the troops” his detractors aren’t forced to consider or debate the issue they likely believe that the us treats black people either as equal to or better than white people and that most or all incidents of police violence against black people are justified everything about the troops is just posthoc rationalization,1,173,1020,72,0.06944444444444445
cmv i think walle is the most plausible dystopian future for the human species not 1984,"i am only half kidding when i say that but at the same time i would make perfect sense to me i know a lot of people like to throw out 1984 or a brave new world as possibilities for a dystopian future however to me i think with global warming social interactions and obesity being as prevalent as they are well you see where i am going 
for those of you who are out of the loop walle is about humans embarking into space after trashing our planet generations in space left their bone mass to near nothing and their bmi off the charts they never talk to each other instead they spend all of their time in front of a screen much like now all the characters are obese and they get around their space ship by moving chairs at the end of the film the captain is applauded for just standing up 
now in my only 25 years of life and having lived most of my life in the us i can see this panning out now more than twothirds of americans are overweight or obese on average americans watch 5 hours and 4 minutes of tv daily according to the new york times now all of us living on a space ship with cute little robots might be a stretch but we are getting fatter and we put in our screen time
lastly and in my opinion the saddest part of the movie is the lack of social interactions again i am 25 and american not that i am saying i am an old timer but it does seem as though we spend more time in isolation in front of a screen i remember as a kid my parents and a lot of my friends parents almost forbid us from spending all our time inside my parents had me in as many sports activities and gatherings as they felt it would help my social development did it na i hate people but still they tried 
my nephew and niece 10 and 5 respectively spend allllll dammmmnn dayyyy in front of a screen they are still pretty thin as when i baby sit those little monster i take them to the park to burn off energy my nieces friends parents sorry that is a mouth full dont do that they are chubby antisocial little kids it honestly hurts my heart but i feel this is our future for the love that is holy please cmv even though i dont really like kids i really want them all to be happy and healthy i really do believe they are our future and all i want for our species is happiness and prosperity i just think we arent on the right path
tldr i think we are getting fat antisocial and are destroying our planet i think we might end up like walle minus the spaceship

cmv conversation is the only way to change someones mind argumentation almost never ever works this is why the majority of protests in the united states will get nothing done,"note i believe that semantically arguing implies that the winner has shown dominance and subordinates the loser while conversing implies that there is no winner or loser which allows for more acceptance of ideas you ever been mad at someone in an argument and realized you were wrong halfway through odds are you didnt admit you were wrong people dont ever want others to subordinate them in a calm discussion have you ever been convinced of a new idea i imagine you have 
 believe the reason groups like the altright exist is because many white men feel that they arent even given a chance to converse but are argued against or they have no interest in conversation in the first place and only want to argue in the first place both are realistic pathways  of the most influential rights activists of all time gandhi and martin luther king jr strictly advocated for nonviolence but did advocate for civil disobedience this would both take away the oppressors ability to subordinate their group and show no willingness to subordinate the oppressor that is part of the reason why their movements were so rapid and successful a white man i fully recognize i have an unfair advantage in many walks of american culture however i have had my accomplishments straight up diminished and discredited because of my white male privilege i am not saying this is wrong but it is a direct attack on something i take pride in naturally a direct attack on something someone takes pride in is subordination when this happens of course i get emotionally invested and i am incapable of having a proper disscussion afterwards  many of the loudest voices in activism tend to subordinate white men and this is why white men end up in the echo chamber that is the altright  want equal opportunity for all and i know that currently we do not have that in this country the fastest way to change that is activism and i fully support those who advocate and fight for their opportunity however to do so requires empowerment of the oppressed never the subordination of the oppressor

cmv the us government is very bad at keeping secrets from its people and any knowledge of extraterrestrial life would be leaked,conspiracy theorists and alien enthusiasts routinely posit the existence of covert government programs which are in possession of either aliens their craft or just knowledge of their existence they go on to explain that the reason we lack proof of these activities is a systematic and exhaustive program of concealment intimidation and psyops disinformation campaigns in my opinion the easiest way to weed out most conspiracy theories is to consider the plausibility of the coverup it involves something publicly salient then people will be inclined to talk  leak it by publicly salient i mean something the average citizen cares about like domestic surveillance prison abuse aliens etc the military can keep technical secrets all day long regular people dont give a shit about how fast a new missile can fly and have no context for the information 700mph ok ghraib was a secret military prison in the middle of a war zone and we got pictures of it chelsea manning edward snowden and julian assange were all willing to endanger their freedom and safety to expose goverment surveillance and secrecy mkultra was a secret program the cia director himself tried to destroy all record of and it still got out i could go on and on we had any alien material it would be the biggest technology endeavor since the manhattan project  which was barely kept secret the germans and soviets quickly knew something about it and were aggressively infiltrating but the manhattan project only had to be kept secret for 3 years before the core truth was revealed and it was kept secret during wwii when the public was a distracted by the war b loyal and conscientious about secrecy and c limited to official government censored news channels putting 130000 people on a project now and keep it secret impossible none of the conditions that enabled wartime secrecy in wwii exist now the public is eager to hear secrets exposed and truths revealed and people are eager and able to give it to them now imagine keeping it secret for decades roswell happened in 1947 if we had aliens for 73 years thats 3 generations of scientists techs guards and officials on the project all kept quiet even through retirement and deathbeds claim that the government or the boogieman du jour is good at silencing people no its not its terrible at it america is actually really fucking free bob lazar for example claims that the mib erased the record of his attendance at mit and caltech and that witnesses were bullied into denying ever knowing him can you imagine a federal agent trying to tell a tenured professor at an elite university that he cant say something you could silence one private citizen or another if theyre in a vulnerable position but on any kind of scale the conspiracy breaks down trump couldnt keep his ukraine deal secret you think hes keeping his lips sealed on et he couldnt not tweet about it hed die ok maybe they dont tell him,1,506,3048,130,0.046153846153846156
cmv as a trans person i believe that current trans activism has completely lost the plot they will lose much of the public debate they choose to engage in due to their overly radical agenda,"my argument is largely philosophical so its somewhat malleable and i legitimately would like yo see it changed i would prefer to believe in and support current trans activism wholeheartedly but far too often find myself shaking my head instead theres a few points on which i base my contention a trans woman i do not believe that i am biologically female and i dont believe that i should have to be to access womens spaces im female like and function well enough as one i look female i experience much of if not the majority of the same baggage as biological females im more physically like a female than a male and pose about as much danger to females as any other female due to the effects of hormones despite this i know that if nature had been left to its own devices i would have been completely capable of reproducing through the production of male sex gametes sperm furthermore i still have male reproductive organs theyve simply been switched off by the effects of long term hormone replacement therapy and potentially could function completely again on the cessation of hormones i think it is an inherently unwinnable fight to argue that i am biologically female based on nothing more than the potential and unproven configuration of my brain hardware have seen trans activism push an agenda that states that biological sex is an entirely socially constructed concept based on the existence of intersex people i think this makes about as much sense as saying that because orange exists red and yellow arent real colors biological sex is at its core about sex gametes in the absence of a reproductive system that functionally produces one its relatively easy to deduce which gamete a persons biology was intended to  produce  even in the presence of the overwhelming majority of intersex conditions and even at an extreme enough end that you can argue an intersex person is not neatly either male or female males and females still exist independent of them this hurts trans activism goals if trans activism spent less time trying to convince people that biological sex is made up and more time educating people about the effects hormones have on trans bodies i believe that we would be much further into achieving our social and political goals by now i believe that we are bogged down in an unwinnable and inherently disingenuous fight we are driving away people who believe in rationalism and science a la people who would actually be very receptive to treating transgenderism as a medical condition with a very specific and unorthodox  treatment regimen and instead of trying to sway them with an argument that appeals to their natures we are fighting them with unscientific rhetoric i have actually changed my view at this point regarding biological sex uconvoces raised to me a really good point that if you can point to an exception within your paradigm then the scientifically honest thing to do is rethink your paradigm if 100 of cases do not work within it then it was too broad ive come to believe that sex is nuanced and while someone might not necessarily fall within a strict female category that does not necessarily indicate that they are males rather biological sex is a mix of different characteristics which are not always able to be defined neatly and the social role a person lives in is as important if not more important than potentially invisible characteristics have seen trans activists push a genitals dont matter argument when it comes to sex and dating while i do not believe that a man dating a preop trans woman is gay genitals are very important to many people when it comes to sex trans activism states that this reduces people solely to their genitals but its frankly terrifyingly batshit to argue to people that the parts used in sex should not matter when it comes to sex it is not transphobic for someone to not want a particular configuration of genitals in their bedroom that is their prerogative this hurts trans activism i have seen lesbians show up in rrelationships and rasktransgender threads describing being shamed and ostracized by their friends for not wanting to sleep with trans women  i have seen gay men do the same regarding trans men the lgb community has typically had a strong association with the t community and they are all potential allies we are united in the ways we are stigmatized yet when we are the ones doing the stigmatizing we risk alienating them from our cause lastly i have seen trans activists argue that you do not need to be gender dysphoric to be transgender merely self identified as something other than your birth sex this fundamentally makes no sense and runs contrary to the entire pathology of what it means to be transgender its as fundamentally incorrect as arguing that gay men dont have to be sexually attracted to men to be gay you just have to self identify gender dysphoria is integral to shaping a transgender identity this particular argument seems purely ideological that people should be allowed to identify as whatever sex they feel like because gender is dead and anything goes i believe at minimum this actually reinforces sexist gender roles since believing that because you are effeminate or gender nonconforming as a man or the inverse as a woman actually makes you the other sex or a third sex undermines the progress feminism has made to insist that women can be masculine and still women or that men can be feminine still men  this hurts trans activism after countless conversations with cis opponents of protrans bathroom laws ive come to the conclusion that most cisgender people could care less what someone who has transitioned does and where they go the bathroom their primary fear comes from the wording typically being used the gender they identify as cis people are most afraid of there being no standards whatsoever imposed on access to sex segregated spaces when were arguing that there should be no bare minimum standards for being identified as the opposite sex we are playing directly into those fears when cis people are afraid that men will wake up and decide they are a woman why are we arguing thats not how it works then turning around and in different conversations arguing that its exactly how it works summation i believe that by embracing radical and untrue tenents based on ideological goals rather than objective reality trans activism is actually driving away potential supporters and otherwise reasonable people who could be potential allies thanks to uiyzie pointing out the scary possibility or republican lawmakers being charged by the evangelical right with determining who is and isnt transgender enough ive partially changed my view on nondysphoric trans people i havent necessarily changed my view that they are not actually transgender people only that it is dangerous to start drawing lines in the sand to determine who is and is not legitimate and that once you establish that power for a reasonable group it becomes easier for unreasonable groups to seize that power so what i have changed my view on is that trans activists pushing the view that anyone can be trans is not necessarily harmful because they are rightfully trying to avoid a legitimate slippery slope

cmv universal basic income is superior to a jobs guarantee,"  
  
ive been paying a lot of attention to the us 2020 elections and in particular some of the policies brought forward by the various candidates two policies in particular that i think are worth examining in more detail are bernie sanders federal jobs guarantee and andrew yangs ubi i think they are interesting in that they are two solutions to the same problem — runaway capitalism — but i ultimately think that of the two a universal basic income is the superior solution i have been a fan of ubi for a while now not sure when i first heard of it but i liked it since i did so i admit to some pro ubi bias and i disliked a job guarantee from the moment i heard of it so i admit an anti jg bias in the spirit of epistemic hygiene i would lay out why i oppose a jobs guarantee why i think a ubi is counterfactually better i would be light in my pro ubi section because of length and what could convince me to change my mind   
  
before we begin id like you to take not of the fact that i said counterfactually better i am not claiming that the status quo is better than a jobs guarantee but that a universal basic income program is better than a jobs guarantee to defend a jobs guarantee its not sufficient to make the case that warts and all its superior to the status quo you must make the case that its superior to a universal basic income the world youd be comparing a jobs guarantee to isnt the status quo but a world with universal basic income  
  
nbsp  

  
nbsp  
  
 i oppose a federal jobs guarantee  
  
 note on incentives
before i lay the case for why i am opposed to a jobs guarantee i would like to talk about my beliefs regarding incentives as they are central to why i oppose job guarantees a defense of these beliefs would be worth its own post so i wouldnt lay out the motivation for these beliefs and would instead just lay out the beliefs themselves i do not take these beliefs as axiomatic so it is not fruitless to argue against them though i would prefer you didnt do that as the burden of evidence required for me to meaningfully change my mind on this is much higher but your efforts would be better served attacking the arguments against a job guarantee directly that said these are my beliefs     
  
 most humans largely have the same preferences most of us have the same basic needs food shelter clothing and similar wants higher status happiness happiness for our loved ones etc theres variation in specifics eg different preferences in types of houses but we do prefer houses generally
 most problems in complex systems involving humans can be explained using incentives systematic bad behaviour is often as a result of incentive structures which incentivise undesirable behaviour amongst members of the system its rarely as a result of personal moral failings of members of the system  
 as a corollary to the above most successes in complex systems involving humans can be explained using incentives systematic good behaviour is often as a result of incentive structures which incentivise desirable behaviour amongst members of the system its rarely as a result of personal moral uprightness of members of the system  
 from the above i conclude that the best way to improve complex human systems is to change the extant incentives rather than to change the people involved either by replacement or modifying their utility function directly if your plan requires people to be especially moral to be effective then its a shite plan the desired outcomes should occur even when the individuals involved have no moralpersonality idiosyncrasies as a result of the incentives in place  
  
nbsp  
  
 case against a jobs guarantee  
  
i am not a gainst a jobs guarantee because of the jobs part but largely because of the guarantee part assuming that the guarantee implies that workers cant be fired excluding extraneous circumstances and theres strong job security a jobs guarantee perverts the incentive structures it decouples employee productivity from employee compensation and removes any incentive employees have to be productive at their workplace without an incentive to be productive employees would be counterfactually much less productive than they would be under private employment one could argue that employee productivity is already decoupled from employee compensation but i would counter that while there isnt a very strong positive correlation between productivity and compensation the two are largely still correlated for example higher productivity may lead to bonuses promotions raises stock options or rise in company valuation for employees who have stock options more benefits etc on the other hand lower productivity may lead to no bonuses less benefits lowered wages demotions getting fired the private sector generally tracks some measure of employee productivity and it seems to factor into decision making they are also incentivised to reward higher productivity and punish lower productivity so its what you would expect  
  
the above leads to a situation in which the average employee in a jobs guarantee program is less productive than a similarly compensated employee in the private sector this makes the economy less efficient as a whole and as each jobs guarantee employee is one less private sector employee there is a reduction in overall productivity furthermore there are allocative inefficiencies as employees in jobs programs may not be matched to the most appropriate application of their skills granted this would also occur in the private sector but a jobs guarantee would exacerbate it further depressing economic output 
  
furthermore employing several tens of millions of people a number that would only rise as accelerating technological advancement displaces more and more private sector employees has massive bureaucracy a lot of resources would be expended merely administering all the workers this giant bureaucracy would likely incentivise systematic inefficiency and lead to even more resource waste  
  
to make matters worse workers admitted into a jobs guarantee program may find it exceedingly difficult to transition to the private sector federal employees already find transitioning to the private sector difficult but a jobs guarantee may make this worse due to skill atrophy as a result of the lowered productivity this creates a class of workers dependent on the government for sustenance this would make ending the jobs guarantee program difficult in the future as it would lead to significant hardship for tens of millions of people and entrenches the inefficiency ultimately this reduces the jobs guarantee program to workfare welfare with a work requirement like the victorian workhouses we are left with a ginormous bureaucracy that is woefully inefficient and wastes both the governments resources and workers  
  
to top it all off workers in a jobs guarantee program are out of luck if they dislike their assigned jobs however as theye dependent on it theyre unlikely to quit as the dependent population would only continue to grow as more and more people are displaced from the workforce all the above problems would become progressively worse  
  
nbsp  
  
 case for a jobs guarantee  
  
the main advantages of a jobs guarantee i see are  
  
1 cost it would be less expensive than a universal basic income program  
2 labour the government gains access to a steady and reliable labour force for various projects like infrastructure development climate change etc  
  
the first is a point in a jobs guarantees favour though it would grow faster than a ubi as each displaced private sector worker is one more jobs guarantee worker as for the second a normal jobs program without the guarantee part seems superior all the advantages without many of the disadvantages as i said before i am not opposed to jobs programs ultimately it seems to me that the only advantage of a jobs guarantee over a universal basic income is cost and i think the benefits of ubi and the disadvantages of a jobs guarantee tip the scale in ubis favour  
  
nbsp  

  
nbsp  
  
 i support universal basic income  
  
there are many reasons to support universal basic income on its own or as an alternative to a jobs guarantee and i dont really want to rehash here what you can read elsewhere so i just linked them above and below ill formulate the arguments most relevant to me  
  
the ssc article goes into more detail about this if you read only one link above read that one but a ubi helps many classes of people that a jobs guarantee does not disabled caretakers parents
  
in my case against a jobs guarantee i mentioned that a jobs guarantee would likely lead to a reduction in economic output ubi does the exact opposite by putting money directly into the hands of everyone ubi acts as a massive financial stimulus to the economy most of the people who receive ubi would spend a lot of their extra income and that money would go to others who would also spend some of the money so the fiscal multiplier would be high the increased money in circulation would likely result in a significant increase in economic ouftput a study by the roosevelt institute on 1000mo predicted a permanent 125 rise in gdp after 8 years  
  
furthermore ubi is likely to increase productivity not only compared to a jobs guarantee world but also compared to the current one ubi gives workers financial independence no longer dependent on their employers government and private sector alike for sustenance they are are free to identify the jobs best suited to their particular skillsets milton friedman said no one spends anothers money as wisely as he spends his own as a corollary to that i would say no one spends anothers labour as wisely as they spend their own the financial independence provided by a ubi would drastically reduce the allocative efficiencies that would exist under a jobs guarantee program and under the current system this could result in a substantial increase in productivity this in particular is one of the things that most excites me about a ubi    
  
administering a ubi has relatively very little bureaucracy involved and much lower administrative costs so there would be less wastage of resources labour capital etc in maintaining a ubi program admittedly the monetary cost due to inefficiency in a jobs guarantee program would be offset by the greater expenses in a ubi program but a ubi also does more and the administrative workers maintaining the bureaucracy would be free to do more productive work  
  
nbsp  

  
nbsp  
  
 to change my mind  
  
i admittedly havent done much research into jobs guarantees so i expect that there are things i am wrong on misunderstanding or whose impact im incorrectly estimating i think it would be easier to shift my mind on a jobs guarantee than on ubi not as much as for incentives but i am pretty firmly in the pro ubi camp and the burden of evidence required to change that is pretty high so ill focus on that in this section  
  
ill be more favourable towards a jobs guarantee if  
  
 the guarantee is softer than i believe and compensation isnt completely decoupled from productivity  
 there are other incentive structures that i am not aware of in place to maintain productivity  
 the us government is competent at administering tens of millions of workers and the bureaucracy involved in administering jobs guarantee workers grows sufficiently sublinearly with the number of workers the resource wastage is otherwise significantly smaller than i currently believe  
 a jobs guarantee program has other benefits over a ubi besides being less expensive and providing the government with a reliable source of labour

cmv apple with tim cook is a terribly run company and if steve jobs was still around to see what it has become he would be disgusted,back when apple was starting out the company had so much vision and risk with products like the apple ii macintosh lisa etc after steve jobs got fired from apple during his short tenure at next he witnessed the company he built turn into a faceless corporation with inferior and boring products like the apple newton power macs basically as much crap as apple could stick their brand on it thry sold it the ceo at the time got fired and was eventually replaced by steve jobs we saw apple begin to get rid of all the suits in the company who were trying to whore the apple brand the brand discounted basically 90 of their product lineup and then steve showed us products like the imac g3 translucent coloured computer ipods macbook the ipad and iphone steve jobs death in 2011 with the final product being the iphone 5s and being replaced with tim cook we have seen little to no innovation with only annual small updates to the iphone the iwatch and only maybe two other notable devices both of which have already been released by various other companies think in regards to apples tight run anticonsumer third party repair and their lack of any totally innovative we see the company again that was run again by suits and cared more about profit than innovation and in the next 10 years we will see apple drop to what blackberry and nokia are now companies afraid to see the future i have changed my mind on the subject for anyone who see this but thought i would still clarify a few things that people have been commenting i in no way dislike tim cook i think hes a great guy and his recent donation to the notre dame cathedral proves how much more generous he is over steve as well i dont think steve jobs was perfect i think he was incredibly flawed and a colossal dick to both his staff and his family with such examples as him belittling his employees to disowning his own daughter i just think its pretty damn impressive of him to bring a company from basically on the verge of bankruptcy to profit and streamlined all of apples devices not many ceos can do that   the iwatch is a great device and is a very popular smartwatch my point was that it was late to the game devices such as the sony ericsson liveview debuted in 2010 and samsung gear in 2013 while the iwatch was 2015 this was both a jobs and cook issue but in honesty if they were just taking their time and spent the time developing it i think it was worth it and from various commentators and seeing them in person their not too bad apple has always been and most likely will continue to be anti third party repairconsumer friendly fixing even an iphone 8 broken screen requires you to basically get it fixed at apple if the touch sensor is broken i have done my fair share of repairs on iphone 7s and newer and their terrible as well macbooks ipads and iwatches but this is becoming not only an issue with apple but other manufactures such as samsung and huawei as well so another view changed  in general yes i believe apple to be a still successful company and only struggling as much as basically every other manufacturer at the moment since basically phones now are capable of doing so much that very little upgrading will be neccesary and eventually everyone will feel this but with apples wealth like nintendo they have can have years ahead of them of lost profits and slumping sales and still stay afloat i have always been a fan of apple especially the story of two guys who made a company from a small garage in palo alto to one of the most recognizable companies on the planet just with steve jobs depature i felt as though tim cook a relatively unknown apple employee taking the ranks of ceo was going to destroy apple and send them to the likes of various other companies that have changed ceos and feel hard but with comments claiming record profits and still rd on the horizon i feel relieved that will see more of them down the road,1,728,3994,134,0.05970149253731343

cmv the political terms left and right are vaguely defined and almost meaningless wed all be better off not using them,this post was inspired by a recent news story  the past few days there has been some controversy over how to describe louis farrakhan after he was banned by facebook a number of news outlets referred to him as farright a number of conservative outlets objected that he has much stronger ties to the democratic party now there is debate over what to call him heres an article which argues that he should be considered right wing heres an article which argues that he belongs to the left  like to propose a third position left and right are stupid terms we shouldnt be wasting time trying to categorize people like this the leftright schism is simply tribalism  argument the terms are meaningless is no agreed upon definition of these terms if you ask 100 people to define these words you will get 100 answers they are so vaguely defined as to be almost meaningless  the terms fall apart if someone takes unconventional stances what do you call a socially conservative socialist what about an antiwar capitalist  leftright schism also stops making sense if you leave your country for example is china left wing or right wing the government calls itself communist and supports a high degree of intervention in the economy these characteristics are typically considered left wing then again theyre also militaristic and anti lgbt these characteristics are typically considered right wing so where do they fit on the leftright spectrum what about russia what about iran  the definitions shift over time when i was a kid left and right were defined differently than they are now if you go back in time further than 100 years the political alliances are almost unrecognizable white supremacists supported government intervention in the economy capitalist were the antiauthoritarians who railed against the conservative monarchists  terms left and right are messy there is no consistent philosophy which underlies them and they serve no purpose the attempt to place everyone into these categories is a giant waste of time  the terms are harmful these terms encourage tribalism too many people support their team unconditionally and are unequivocally opposed to anything which they associate with the other team instead of evaluating issues rationally people get caught up in an imaginary war with the rival tribe  lot of people develop stereotypes in their head place the most reprehensible people on the other team and then generalize that persons characteristics to everyone else perceived as belonging to that team the democrats dont support stalin and the republicans dont support hitler but leftright thinking encourages people to make those associations how much animus and bickering could we avoid if people didnt engage in this type of tribalistic thinking   thoughts reality few of us fit neatly into one of these categories were all susceptible to tribalism sometimes but ultimately we all have our own unique perspective we have varying opinions and we try our best to think logically the leftright schism doesnt reflect the variety of ideas and perspectives which exist  terms are overly simplistic and derail political dialogue there is no consistent definition and attempting to categorize people this way is a waste of brain cells,1,540,3589,126,0.03968253968253968
cmv incoming migration in relatively healthy economies is almost always beneficial produces jobs and helps growth in the long run migration is economically desirable,"ive studied international relations for a while and ive gotten familiarized with history geopolitics economics and the like its not hard to encounter evidence of migration being beneficial for economies that are growing but its also not hard to encounter people who oppose migration on a moralethic basis or on personal opinion most of the time they misrepresent migration phenomena they think latinamerican migration to the us is increasing or they think their countries are migrant destinations instead of transit countries or do not understand what migrants are like in each specific phenomenon ie mexican migrants are drug dealers muslim migrants are terrorists japanese migrants are spies jewish migrants are tax evaders and so on and so forth have a wealth of evidence that migration is beneficial for economies im looking for evidence to counter what i already have at hand because i want to learn and because im not comfortable without evidence against what i learned and so i make this post in order to look for good sources proving cases where migration has had negative impacts in a countrys economy are only four catches if its your opinion i dont care if i was changing your view i would give you numbers not what i think if the information comes from something as biased as breitbart i will not consider it at all doctored reports exists on both sides if i was changing your view i would give you quality sources even when i know the independent would provide evidence supporting my stance the information must be pertaining to countries that are relatively economically stable i will not consider crippled economies getting more crippled as a basis to say migration harms economies of course this does not mean i will only consider perfectly healthy 100 economies it just means that if the country had a crisis before a mass migration i will not consider migration as the cause of a crash id like to focus on economy i know that sociocultural problems have been born from migration historically and i can find plenty of evidence of this myself this is why im focusing on the economic effects of migration rather than the social ones please consider this im doing this as part of a discipline towards research and investigation not because im trying to qualify migration as good or bad than that anything goes history papers articles opinions from professionals that can back their stance up testimonies from people who had access to information like governors and presidents of the past books you name it  thread is overwhelming from the get go i have to say that this community is amazing because ive yet to find a single person who was aggressive bigoted or xenophobic in the discussion when i expected a shit storm the amount of information here is just massive and it is comprised of wellresearched sources personal experience from privileged points of view like people who has employed migrants or foreigners a lot and can testify about their experience with them wellfounded opinions and perspectives from across the world only think it is fair to the amount of people who have been dedicated enough to post wellrounded responses that i declare all the multiple ways in which my view changed it was hard to prove that migration does not aid in the long run but it was easier to prove that it seriously stresses the lowerincome population in the short and medium term if you want to look for that evidence it is enough to browse the multiple replies migration to welfarestates poses different challenges countries that wholeheartedly admit migration have a more serious budget stress that may not be sustainable migration has tougher effects i the micro level that in the macro level sure the economy might develop but a few affected communities can have a tougher time it is hard to quantify exactly how much migrants take out or put in in the short run the evidence i have is that they supply much more than they take in the long run but some posters were able to show higher impacts in the short run

cmv measurements by weight in recipes are superior to measurements by volume in recipes,"i frequently search for recipes online and find it annoying that the vast majority of recipes i find use measurements in cups rather than measurements in grams or ounces i can think of no good reason that measurements in cups are still so common beyond a stubborn reluctance to adopt a clearly superior system if i understood a practical reason why people insist on volume measurements i might find the whole business less irritating my reasons are kitchen scales are cheap and easily available and are not substantially more expensive than a full set of measuring cups
 they are considerably more precise than volume measurements as 1 cups can vary considerably in volume from near 200ml to as high as 250ml edit  see this wikipedia page for an outline of different systems with differing volumes and 2 equivalent weights of ingredients often do not occupy the same volume eg packed vs unpacked flour edit  or differently chopped fruit veg etc
 linked to the above recipes using weight will be more consistent in their results and closer to what was intended by the recipes author
 there is less washing up associated with measuring by weight  all measurements can be done by adding directly to the mixing bowl with no need of numerous additional containers to this measurement of oilbased liquids where there is not a neat 1g1ml ratio may be better to measure by volume especially as these are often directly added to hot pans so would be difficult to weigh
 very small quantities less than 1tsp are likely better measured with an appropriately sized measurement spoon due to the limits of precision in cheap kitchen scales that will not change my view scales are still more expensive than cups  the cost of scales is under £10 and as such is comparable to most basic kitchen equipment such as pots and pans
 people are used to volume measurements and manage fine with them  acknowledgement of this is why my view is measurement by weight is superior rather than all recipes should use weight measurements would change my view a significant advantage of volume measurements that i am unaware of
 evidence that my perceptions of the advantages of weight measurement are not accurate
 evidence that the cost of kitchen scales is an insurmountable obstacle for a large enough number of people that it would be unfair to ask them to convert from weight to volume measurements ie the majority of people most new comments seem to be rehashing the same points as older ones the general consensus seems to be weighing is more precise agreed
 precision isnt always that important also agreed
 volume is more convenient disagree  as best as i can tell my disagreement on this one is due to a combination of differences in common container sizes for flour etc in the uk vs the us and differences in relative levels of practice with different methods of measurement
 cheap scales are bad at very small quantities agreed unlikely to reply to anything further unless its significantly different from these points",1,516,3190,88,0.045454545454545456

cmv the clock in a soccer game should be stopped for stoppages rather than adding stoppage time,"i was having a sportsrelated discussion with my brother in law earlier today and we stumbled on this topic  neither of us are big soccer fans but we both like sports in general we both watch football which has its own flaws and baseball which also has its flaws i later found this article

 still don’t understand why a referee in charge of timing can’t just stop the clock for things like injuries goals and such my reasoning other timed sports have this mechanism the clock stops in american football for various events the clock stops in hockey for fouls and goals the clock stops in basketball for fouls and i believe after baskets later in the game in some formats 
 the clock not stopping and leaving it to the referee to determine stoppage length leads to timewasting that is against the spirit of competition even if it is not technically against the rules  think of the instances of a player knocking the ball away from an opponent about to throw the ball in or continuing to dribble the ball away from opponents when it is not their possession these tactics along with the prevalence of flopping imo are detrimental to gaining new fans especially in america
 knowing exactly when a game or period of play ends is better than the referee deciding it in any semiarbitrary manner the article i linked mentions that referees are unlikely to blow the play dead in the middle of an attack i think that this is bad practice the clock runs out on american football teams in the middle of a drive all the time basketball players are forced to take an unlikely shot because the clock is running out and the ref isn’t going to let them just play out the whole possession after the clock hits zero
 if guidelines and best practices exist as to when to add stoppage time including stoppage time during stoppage time why can’t rules exist regarding stopping the clock discretion is a dangerous thing especially when being influenced by a home crowd  folks i like sports i’d like to appreciate soccer more even if i don’t go out of my way to watch games outside the world cup i’ve heard the argument about stoppages leading to commercials i don’t buy that soccer stoppages aren’t generally long enough to squeeze in ads there aren’t timeouts the terrible concept of a tv timeout doesn’t exist like it does in basketball games you’re not gonna cut away during a penalty kick where the clock runs and injuries suck but i don’t see any loss of value if you replace footage of a guy on the turf getting stretchered off with a commercial or two",1,459,2746,98,0.030612244897959183

cmv tik tok is the most toxic popular social media platform currently used,edit i find it interesting that so many people are saying things like “well my algorithm works fine for me” or “well you are on the wrong side of tik tok” without disputing that the “side of tik tok” im on is incredibly toxic what you are essentially saying is “ just like not all men or not all cops the argument here is there is a toxic side to tik tok and the toxicity on that side is more toxic than other social media platforms also before one more person says it i dont dislike the content i see i can enjoy the content but also be aware that it has negative psychosocial effects on myself and others  ill start of by saying this i downloaded tiktok expecting haha funny videos like vine but was bombarded by the algorithm showing me gorgeous people either showing off how gorgeous they are or how rich they are or on the other side complaining about how ugly they are and how they will be single forever with the occasional funny video sprinkled throughout  quick scroll through will show like i said people mostly gen zers scantily clad chasing internet clout perpetuating unrealistic body standards obviously i dont think these people are purposely trying to perpetuate unrealistic body standards but with the algorithm that pushes popular videos to your feed based on what you like you are way more likely to see the gorgeous people with a million likes than the average person with average likes basically telling you the average person that in order to have worth in this world you have to be gorgeous and not have clothes on some tiktokers have called this out by posting shirtless videos and clothed videos simultaneously with the same content and noting how many more likes the shirtless video got but continue to post shirtless for the clout these people preach body positivity all day but when a normal looking person makes a video that maybe isnt edited the best the comments border on bullying whereas when a pretty person does the same the comments are wow so quirky mental health has become a plot device for clout there is a distinct difference between reducing the stigma of mental health issues and using it in a video to get likes i saw a video recently where a girl who was objectively pretty was saying how ugly and annoying she was and how mentally unhealthy she was in a comedic way with over 2 million likes now im in no way saying she doesnt struggle with mental illness but it seems like these creators are realizing that things like mental illness will resonate with viewers just to get likes which devalues it and reduces the ability to open up meaningful dialogue about mental health  i know these issues are not exclusive to tiktok people have been chasing clout on insta and facebook for years but i think the introduction of a videoonly site where people are pretty much encouraged to be racy for likes and where a computer algorithm decides who sees what makes tiktok incredibly toxic and damaging especially for teens and young adults,1,533,3056,75,0.06666666666666667
cmv in rpgs being evil should be easier than being good,edit by good i really mean heroic in video games good is generally understood to mean luke skywalker and evil is understood to mean darth vader people who pay their taxes and drive under the speed limit are good people but they arent who im talking about here i dont mean easier as in you get a bit more cash or a sweet gun by playing a bad guy i mean there should be major metalevel reasons to entice players to be evil and dissuade them from being good a lot of video games with morality systems theres usually no meaningful difference between playing as a good person and playing as a bad person i say meaningful because while some dialogue may be different and you may get different benefits the problem lies in the balance my belief that the root of evil is selfishness and the root of good is selflessness if kim jong un could lead the lifestyle he leads today without keeping his people effectively in slavery wouldnt he probably only especially depraved psychopaths would choose to make people suffer if there was no benefit to themself who we think of as heroes do the opposite as kim they make personal sacrifices to help others and the greater that sacrifice is the more heroic they are this is the approach i think games with morality systems should take the first bioshock in it you have a moral choice to kill kids in order to gain more powers adam or set them free this would be a moral dilemmaif you didnt get rewarded with the same amount of adam a little bit afterwards for setting them free the only actual dilemma going on is if you want the adam right then or to get a lump sum of it shortly thereafter its a great game otherwise mass effect its another great game but it handles being good and evil in the opposite way that it should ultimately to keep all your squadmates and get the best endings you have to make the good choices meaning being good is the easy route that gets you the best rewards sure being evil gets you more money but in that series money really isnt important and theres plenty of nonevil ways to make money anyway so its ultimately a nonfactor as far as benefits go consider vampyr its not a great game but it handled the morality system almost perfectly in my opinion first there are no good or evil dialogue options second there is no difficulty setting why because the difficulty of the game is determined by how strong you make your character how do you make your character stronger by killing people and drinking their blood of course in this game theres a number of locations in london that have characters in them and you can kill and feed off of all of them to gain more vampire powers so if the game gets too hard you can just kill some people to get more powerful than the enemies you have to fight its a simple solution and its undoubtedly evil a player who genuinely wants to be good person is therefore forced to play on the games hardest difficulty and has to keep people from dying on their own you play as a doctor in the plagueridden victorian era of england its pretty challenging and completely unnecessary to your goal in the story but then thats what being a hero is all about isnt it did say the games morality was almost perfect though while the beginning of the game is very challenging as a good guy the last half is still rather easy even though you can get way stronger by being evil and get more cool vampire powers it still becomes a cakewalk by the end and being good gets you the best ending vampyr didnt truly exemplify a meta moral dilemma between good and evil its concept of it was deadon in my opinion,1,669,3792,58,0.1206896551724138
cmv the usa is still suffering from the lingering effects of mccarthyism,this is coming from an outsiders perspective but i dont think that necessarily makes my view less relevant anyway onwards seemingly pathological fear of the red menace in the us is holding it back from progress this is a developed nation in which the sentiment of can i afford to be ill is not uncommon where you could go into debt for having the audacity to need emergency care which you couldnt have foreseen theres the joke that breaking bad could happen only in america because affording treatment anywhere else in the west is easy any attempt to reduce the costs are pejoratively labelled socialist and seen as anticapitalist i dont think it necessarily is since healthy workers are inevitably better workers just because it inevitably requires tax increase doesnt always make something socialist and even so just because something is socialist doesnt make it a bad idea the fact that the affordable healthcare act was named that despite that from the outside it not being all that affordable and affordable healthcare wasnt generally seen as pretty sensible is crazy amount of debt students leave university with is so large grand gestures are made to pay off their loans although the uk also has sizeable debt it isnt held against your credit rating issuing and repayment are means tested and is wiped after 30 years so isnt really comparable the idea that someone could be denied education because they dont know if they can afford it seems completely unjust response may be that this is just rhetoric but the rhetoric clearly works meaning it isnt just the political class but a national culture of seeing anything offering equality of opportunity as evil lefty insidiousness americans love the idea of freedom its the  export but it doesnt look like a very free nation where people can be trapped in poverty due to the cost of bettering themselves or fluke of illness the fact that in the uk no matter how little you earn you know you can be seen by a gp or get a degree appears like vastly greater freedom to me i would also add i think the usas overton window is still reduced as a result or mccarthyism the sequal alright guys and gals i think im done here thanks for your time,1,386,2303,73,0.1232876712328767
cmv i think drinking until blackingout is an asshole think to do,i think that drinking until blackingout in any public place or in any instance where you can affect a third person is an asshole thing to do for example i recently read a post where op had trouble with his gf drinking beyond her capabilities and ended up like a bag of potatoes that op had to take care off any reply saying that she should not drink until blacking you received negative feed back and i do not know why it really i was drunk i cant remember a valid excuse to any mishaps also think that even if nothing bad happens drinking that much is not a good thing to do because drinker exposes the group or the people around them to a bit of danger and that exposure alone is a bad thing to put anyone thru it someone then tell my why is it really a bad view should anyone be able to drink what ever they want even if it makes the people around them uncomfortable  is there a limit where it is acceptable i am not considered alcoholics here that is a different question 2 i should not treat this as a black or white situation i still think going beyond your limit is bad but there are definitely more to look into each individual situation 3 it seems you could be functional while blacked out so probably i should have written that drinking until becoming sickneedyproblematic is an asshole thing to do 4 i agree that honest mistakes can happen and everyone should have a few get free of jail cards because you do not always know your limits but after a few anyone should get used to it and not knowing your limits is not longer an excuse,1,297,1609,66,0.06060606060606061
cmv copyright should be reduced to 28 years works should be archived upon registration and fair use should be extended,the way artists create new works is by making derivatives of older works with copyright being 70 years after death it takes far to long for artists to create remixes if someone cant recuperate the costs for making a work before 28 years is over that is their fault and they are to blame  use should be extended to include fan works especially nonprofit ones one man made a remake of a metroid game that looked really good nintendo took it down probably because it contested their remake this is an instance where copyright went against its purpose of  incentivizing new works and actively stomped on it someone registers a work the government should archive the work so that it can later be released to the public domain this is especially important for works under always online drmwhich should not exist but im not arguing that now that wont function when the servers go offline am arguing for reform rather than abolition because artists both deserve to be payed for their efforts and they will be less willing to create works without some reward some do anyway though only reason i accept copyright even with it being a total abomination is that we live under a shitty capitalistic society where nonsense like this is currently necessary,1,218,1280,122,0.03278688524590164

cmv trans people often lack direction and center their identity around their gendertrans status,ive been trying to better understand motivations behind transitioning but am hung up on one point as an lgbt person i really want to understand so please help me reddit my thoughts about this are still pretty jumbled so feel free to ask for clarification about anything i dont explain well main hangup is that it seems like trans people have taken on their gender or trans status as a huge focus point of their lives ive never met a trans person who before transition was a lawyer or successful business owner with lots of interesting hobbies instead it seems more often than not to be someone who lacks direction and finds community with other trans people and purpose in the transition process while i think people should be free to identify however they choose i cant help but think someone must be a pretty boring person if their gender or trans status is one of their most interesting and defining qualities often see this in the gay community too ive seen so many ladies take their sexuality on as their entire identity after coming out they cut their hair wear rainbow stuff buy flannel with the goal of looking more gay  if you asked me to describe myself in a handful of words then i would say that im a scientist triathlete animal lover math wiz  disorganized person a great friend i might add that i value being a good partner to my wife but the fact that my wife and i both have lady bits isnt one of my defining aspects i genuinely feel that if i woke up tomorrow as a man then that would not be ideal but not a big enough issue that id put all that energy into transitioning i dont see how i could transition while also dedicating myself to my career and hobbies to the extent i currently do and those things are way more important to me than my gender summarize i want to better understand transitioning but am stuck on this idea that to transition someone must be centering their identity around their gender or trans status that leads me view people who are transitioning as boring or lacking hobbies and purpose it also makes me think we shouldnt encourage young people to transition during teenage  college years people are still figuring out who they are and sometimes temporarily latch onto ideas find religion etc while figuring out what they want out of life i should clarify that what ive said only would imply to someone currently transitioning if someone transitioned in the past then what ive said here would apply at the time of their transition and would say nothing about who they now are,1,459,2594,97,0.041237113402061855

cmv django and dr king shultz should have just tried to buy django’s wife directly instead of attempting the whole mandingo business,warning spoilers for the movie django unchained  absolutely love tarantino’s django but i consider it a pretty big plot hole or at the least very poor reasoning on the part of dr schultz to insist that they couldn’t simply offer to buy broomhilda from calvin candie the idea that calvin wouldn’t sell her because she simply isn’t important enough to bother selling doesn’t really hold water with me this idea to offer to buy a mandingo instead was extremely dangerous would have been very hard to pull off and seems totally unnecessary it obviously led to some very serious consequences  get that calvin wouldn’t have been interested in selling her for normal market value especially if he knew that it was to reunite her with her husband but the fact that she spoke german would have been enough of a pretext for dr schultz to show up and offer maybe double or triple her market value simply for her german candie probably has a man that is in charge of buying and selling slaves and dr schultz would have just needed to approach this man i think this would have been an easy and practical solution but maybe i am missing something cmv,1,205,1165,135,0.06666666666666667

cmv the fat acceptance movement normalizes obesity,"people come in all shapes and sizes and promoting body positivity is great but i am not convinced that we should throw our hands up and encourage people to maintain unhealthy lifestyles because they cant or dont want to lose weight fat people are the target of discrimination and bullying due to their weight which is undeniably wrong but promoting fatness is not the way to support fat people 
i understand that defining health is a complex issue and its not as easy saying that person has some extra lbs therefore they arent healthy but the fat acceptance movements sheltering of obesity normalizes poor health obesity is a serious problem and the fat acceptance movement allows us to bypass facing the obesity epidemic as a society there are major systematic changes that we as a society need to address in order to have a healthier populous and accepting that obesity is okay or promoting it is a barrier to the hard work of changing the way our culture treats food diet and exercise 
people deserve respect but part of that respect should include real discussions about weight and finding better ways to support people to illustrate a few examples of the trends ive seen and point out the difference between the intent of the movement and the byproducts of it im on mobilize so i apologize for formatting are a number of fativits who write about how being fat is good ive interpreted that as promoting fatnessobesity
examples
 im fat its ok series proves fat is beautiful obesity can find fat is fabulous posts all over tumblr and other social media sites 
 think the difference here is the original intent of the movement i see that the intent of the movement is to end discrimination against fat people but i think many individuals use that as a scapegoat to normalize obesity cathy young wrote a succinct article that reflects my thoughts that may be a better descriptor  pro fat an unhealthy status quo 2 post cmv 
a number of people have illustrated the difference between the fat acceptance movement and the fat people acceptance movement which is the key differentiator for me yes there are radicals as in any movement who take the message further to say that obesity the illness is healthy which is not true but as i understand the moderates of the fat acceptance movement simply aim to normalize the existence of obese people in an effort to make their lives less hellacious there are a lot of people who are hung up on the normalizing aspect of this thread and who have pointed out that of course the movement aims to normalize obesity i posted this thread with a common understanding that obesity the illness is bad and should not be upheld glorified promoted etc that said i understand there are differentiating interpretations on the word normalizing i see the point that normalizing doesnt always equate to condoning as in we should normalize mental health issues but that does not mean we glorify mental health problems thus i think my real issue here has been associating the movement and its intent with radicals i would therefore appreciate links to resources that are upstanding representations of moderate thinkers of the fat acceptance movement thanks to everyone for your input thought provoking conversation and for changing my view ",1,562,3799,52,0.07692307692307693
cmv ui design is and has been moving in the wrong direction since the rise in popularity of apple devices,apple built their modern product lines around a few simple ideas make the products attractive make the hardware high quality and make it easy to use the iphone and other apple products have gained a ton of popularity ive noticed a trend in ui design for websites apps phones games everything and thats to make things simple the problem is that life is not simple and products are being designed too simply to the point where they lose utility most recent example of this that prompted this post was facebook i wanted to make a simple status about a concert im going to next week i made the post clicked tag an event searched the concert except instead of giving me every result for that search or giving me an option to see other options or really anything that could possibly have been useful facebook picked the top 10 related events within 5 days of the current date and refused to show me anything else maybe its different on the desktop site but on the app there is literally no option whatsoever to expand your search yesterday i was making an instagram post some pictures were landscape some were portrait on instagram you can only see the crop size for the first picture of an album for no discernable reason when you select multiple photos it just resizes all the rest of them according to how the first one is sized and youre just strictly not allowed to change them could list examples all day but the trend in ui design is no longer how functional can we make our products its how can we guess what people want so as not to confuse them with options what happened to just putting more options or the three dots or three lines indicating a menu for people who wanted more options this being tied to apple is more just my idea and speculation but the trend is what bothers me i feel in the pursuit of making everything user friendly we are making products do less and be less functional for no reason and in ways that could easily just be crammed into an options menu while still maintaining a modern and streamlined design the new trend is to just straight up remove functionality from products which i think makes them harder to use,1,393,2230,107,0.056074766355140186
cmv we the united states should focus less on mexican illegal immigration and more on fixing mexico,while i do understand that there are several problems that are caused by illegal immigration such as drug crime human trafficking and lower wages in particular vocations it is also true that the majority of people from mexico flee to america for the betterment of themselves and their families mexico has failed their people and they just want to live in a more just and free society if i were mexican and lived in the same desperation i would absolutely do what i had to do to get to america  i propose is working with the mexican government to end the corruption and drug trade by any means possible make it a safe place to live work and raise a family i believe we can accomplish this by forging an alliance with mexico and utilize our armed forces to target and eliminate the cartels once they are gone assist the government with the help of our fbi and cia to flush out the corrupt government officials  belief is that doing this not only would we strengthen mexico and allow it to reach its full potential we could also put a huge dent in the cocaine heroin and methamphetamine problem in the us as well as in canada  have been to mexico several times the landscape culture and people are truly fantastic in my view there is no reason why we shouldnt do what we can to help our neighbors to the south while also benefitting the us and canada as well apologise for typosgrammar this was written on my phone you know how it goes,1,268,1481,103,0.07766990291262135

cmv politicians should not be judged by the character of their supporters,i hear a lot of criticism of politicians based on the supposed character of their supporters andrew yang gets questioned because some white nationalists support his candidacy and a lot of articles mention the support he gets on places like 4chan bernie sanders supporters are widely stereotyped as cultish fanatical misogynistic “bernie bros going back to 2008 i remember clinton and obama supporters accusing each other of being misogynistic and racist respectively don’t think this is helpful a candidate is not responsible for their supporters they are responsible for their own actions and the actions of their surrogates and subordinates only put another way the problem with donald trump is not that david duke supports him but that the president supports david duke or at least the racist ideas that white nationalists espouse i think criticizing candidates based on the character of their supporters is specifically unhelpful in andrew yangss case white nationalists might support universal basic income ubi because they think it will help poor white people however this is beside the point we should be asking if ubi is a good idea would it actually help poor white people what about black people women rural people or urban dwellers what would its impact on the economy be talking about a candidate’s supporters distracts from what the candidate is actually advocating for caveat to this is that it seems fair to criticize a candidate as being more or less electable based on the cohort of their supporters it is valid to argue that biden is good general election candidate due to his high level of support in midwestern states it would be fair to argue that sanders support among young people wouldn’t translate into electoral college wins as turnout among millennials and gen z is too low im not sure if either statement is true but they are at least worth considering i probably come across as a angry andrew yang supporter  i actually don’t  particularly support the guy im uncertain whether ubi would be helpful in part because it hasn’t been tried on a large scale based on the first comment i think i didnt make my argument clear  if a candidate is supporting racism and sexism or inciting violence against minorities they bear responsibility for encouraging hatred and violence and they have blood on their hands but if the candidate is not encouraging hatred and they are not allowing their surrogates to do so they are not responsible if some of their supporters are hateful people our focus should be on what the candidate herselfhimself is saying and doing 2 uarcosapphire and ulostinlight make the point that candidates supporters can recognize things about a candidate that we dont either because a candidate doesn’t publicize their position or because they employ dog whistle rhetoric if a candidate receives the support of a particular group of people we should endeavor to find out why it will likey tell us something about the candidate that might not be publicized in their platform,1,505,3510,74,0.06756756756756757
cmv working hard doesn’t actually pay off in the workplace instead you get more work stress and responsibility while mediocre or sub par employees reap the benefits,"i genuinely want my view changed but my work experience has made me question if working hard is actually benefitting me
 consider myself a very hard worker specifically i am very efficient reliable and productive  i have worked several office jobs now where i was quickly promoted and given more responsibilities based on my work ethic  at times i’ve received small raises and bonuses but nothing significant  i feel i’m doing two to three times the amount of work as a colleague but we are in the same role and being paid almost the same amount  additionally because they have consistently demonstrated that they are less reliable the expectation of them is quite low and they are given easier tasks or less tasks while i pick up the slack  
 few years ago i found myself in a position where i valued a stress free environment over money  i took a part time low paying job that i felt i could excel in but not feel burnt out  three years later i am the owner’s right hand working full time and carrying out way more responsibilities than anyone at the company and things that are typically outside of my job description because i’m “the only one that can be trusted to do a good job”
 feel that working hard and being responsible has led to a cycle of getting more work piled on while others get to sit back and let me take on all the stress  the expectations of me are much higher bc i’ve set a precedent that seems impossible to back out of  
 often left with two thoughts  1 why should i work so hard show up on time etc if i could essentially do half as much and be given the same pay and job security  2 how do i get out of this perpetual cycle of showing my good work ethic without being taken advantage of and becoming resentful it seems as if mediocrity would serve me better in the long run  
 realize that it’s good to take pride in your work and feel good about doing an honest job  but that’s not keeping my spirits up  i think companies are greedy and as soon as you prove your reliability and willingness to go above and beyond they jump on the opportunity to pile on the work and squeeze as much out of you as they possibly can  
 don’t want to be a subpar employee or bitter and resentful  please cmv",1,435,2277,170,0.029411764705882353
cmv drivein through coffee should be served at a temperature where if you immediately take a drink you will not burn your tongue,"let me clarify that i am only talking about drivethrough if you are sitting in the restaurant and want to take your time and carefully slurp the very top layer off as it cools i understand that also understand that some people dont want to drink their coffee while driving but prefer to take it to work or whatever destination what about people who want to drink it on the road when i get up at 4am and have a 25hour drive and i want coffee it bothers me when it is served at a temperature too hot to drink it has a lid and an insulated cup so it takes a very long time to cool im tired and want my coffee i cant take the lid off or it will spill i frankly cant even safely test the temperature because roads arent perfectly smooth and an attempt to take a small sip can be ruined by even a tiny bump who want to drink only at their destination have more options they can bring a coffeemaker to work or carry a thermos and pour the coffee into it for better insulation who want to drink on the road have no other option but to wait with the lid on scared to take a sip its unconscionable  couple of counters to common replies serving temperature and brewing temperature are not the same  is a microroastery guide on optimal brewing temperature which by the way is not boiling which goes into more depth

 is a medical paper on the ideal coffee temperature to avoid burns publishe din the medical journal burns in 2008

 to this article the ideal serving temperature which was determined using both data about risk of burns and the subjective taste and experience preference of 300 subjects was 136 degrees however the average serving temperature at restaurants is between 165 and 180 degrees ice is not a good solution i am working on a longer writeup for this point including calculations of heat transfer but lunch is being served ill try to work on it asap update  i am too lazy to do math but aside from still providing an inexact time over which the temperature changes my other issue here is theres no reason to think this will lower it to the proper amount without lowering the temperature too much it may still be too hot or too cold let me add more emphasis to a small part of this its not just that i want my coffee to be generally a bit cooler there are lots of solutions to that i want it to basically be as hot as possible without actually causing burns at a biological level if it is hot enough to make me pull back or say whoa thats hot its fine if its hot enough to kill the top layer of skin cells on my tongue its not outside of people who actually like being burned the only reason to serve it above the temperature that causes burn seems to be if you want to carry it and drink it later which i addressed in the first part of the question  concept ive had to go into a few times is drinkable window we all have a range of temperatures where we find coffee drinkable theres some subjectiveness here of course but i argue that most people dont actually drink coffee when it would burn them they wait until it cools sipping off the top until it gets there if we take the temperature at which they actually start taking full sips instead of tentative slurps and measure how long it takes for that temperature to reach the too cold area that time remains the same regardless of how hot the coffee initially was it doesnt have a memory of how how it was a few minutes ago  the total drinkable window of the coffee is unchanged by the starting temperature only by your personal preference of how wide that range is the only reason to serve it hotter than the high end of that preference is if youre planning to store it for a bit before drinking which i think is a small number of cases i think it is more reasonable and safer for them to put the hot coffee into an insulated container while parked than for me to try and sip scalding coffee while i drive to test whether it is safe to drink and if i just let it sit for an extended safe period of time i have missed out on a lot of that drinkable window ive invested a lot of time into this as it is a slow day at work i still should not have as i have a long list of things to do from this point on i will probably only respond to things that are original or that are easy to reply to thanks for a fun conversation everyone i hope others who agree with me will carry on the debate with more vigour as i step back a bit i think a redditor has just changed my life  find you and guild you soon but im trying to finish my inbox and ive neglected a bit of work i have to do before 5 sorry man bother me if i dont get to it tonight oops i still ahvent guilded him according to a redditor dutch bros coffee not only offers this already but even uses the term drinkable

cmv there are no extra ethical obligations for white parents who adopt children of color,"this may be a bit of a niche issue i was recently told that it was justifiable for parents seeking to adopt children to prefer children of their own race because there is an increased burden specifically in the context of white parents adopting black children to provide a child of color with role models and peers of that color the justification for this view was in part that only people of color could effectively speak to a child of color about experiencing racism and secondly that culturally the child of color should be exposed to but not forced into their associated culture strikes me as backwards for several reasons 
this view promotes systemic racism in adoption white parents are statistically in better positions to adopt children than black parents are but under this view black children are potentially denied opportunities to be adopted because the view promotes arbitrary and illusory difficulties associated with raising them to me the overwhelming benefits of having a stable family would outweigh any of the problems that might result from white parents adopting a black child but i do not think these are real problems to begin with  it seems problematic to me to suggest that just because a child has a certain skin color and ancestry they should be exposed to the culture associated with that skin color and ancestry this isnt to say that african american culture or any other culture in america is invalid only that its okay if a black kid grows up without getting exposure to american african american culture from their parents and even if this is a legitimate concern the internet basically ensures that every child today can have exposure to any culture that interests them  only problem that i think comes the closest to being legitimate is that it may be difficult for a white parent to speak with authority on issues of experiencing racism but i have two solutions for white parents they can research the issue and relay advice from people of color on the issue to their child good advice is good advice even if it is relayed through a pair of white people or they can focus on teaching their child how to learn for themselves which is something they should do anyways then the child can learn from voices of color on their own or in tandem with the parent neither method i think requires anything the parent shouldnt already be doing for their child  person who espoused these views is someone i have immense respect for but we just could not come to an agreement one way or the other in the short time of our discussion so im interested in seeing what the people of this wonderful subreddit have to say and changing my view if it makes sense",1,473,2749,90,0.044444444444444446
cmv the superhero genre is really just centered around spectacle and the creative exploration of superpowers but there is no real depth to it in general,"warning there is a spoiler for the marvel film civil war ahead writer brandon sanderson once said what your magic cant do is more interesting than what it can do i heard this phrase it really made me appreciate how true that is soon after i watched the marvel movie civil war and realized that basically all superheroes are mary sues and they all have equal power levels while watching it i got the sense that they were all just made of invincibilium and the fighting didnt mean anything nobody was going to be permanently injured much less killed when they are killed its always built up and has an obvious subversion of the rules of the universe up until that point when don cheadles character was crippled by falling from the sky i almost laughed out loud here we have a movie full of highpowered superheroes fighting each other and yet the only significant injury is from a guy falling and hitting the ground its pretty absurd really why i think this shows that the films arent meant for a postjuvenile audience is that when youre a kid all you care about is how awesome the superheroes are you dont want them to have weaknesses but once you reach a certain age things change in movie reviews for other genres youll often read the critic espousing what a wellrounded and human character soandso is and that almost always involves their flaws as well as their strengths because we understand that this is what an interesting character is heroes journey almost always involves a person who is mediocre weak or somehow not as good as they could be the story is about them growing improving maturing whatever  and eventually coming out a better stronger person on the other side superheroes dont really follow this arc often they start off normal or whatever but then they just skip straight to becoming powerful and never stop noticed this in the arrowverse tv shows also very often a plot will revolve around a superhero either killing or not killing and the internal struggle of this i think this is often a point in the story because once you have a mary sue superhero who is unkillable the drama can only come by them choosing to utilize their power to its full extent or not to me this is very boring its kind of like taking something immature and trying to contrive it into something more mature like vincent adultman on bojack horseman okay that was a bit of a stretch heard people say try to defend the superhero genre but i feel like this is kind of indefensible i mean dont get me wrong i think superhero movies speak to a very real part of us all the part that thinks people with superpowers are fucking awesome which they are but thats only because you dont care about the things that end up being more important in fiction we just love the spectacle of it i think the only really potentially interesting characters in the superhero genre are villains they are vulnerable obviously  theyre always defeated by the superheroes  and the potential is always there for a compelling and humanistic backstory  the batman series does this well probably some others too however i think there arent enough interesting villains like this to vindicate the genre as a whole as often its acceptable to just have the villains be fairly onedimensional this has gotten a lot of attention so i guess ill address a couple quick things acknowledge that characters can change over time despite being invulnerable dark knight and watchmen are two good examples of superhero movies that subvert many tropes of the genre true im a fan of both in batman in particular though i think the villains are equally as interesting as the hero if not more so and watchmen is a unique spin on the superhero genre almost more like an indictment of it than a part of it moment i remember from when i was younger that opened my eyes about superheroes is this speech from the film angus superman is not brave  superman is invulnerable

cmv circumcision should be banned in infants and children unless there is a medical issue,i myself was circumcised most women i talked to about it prefer circumcised guys but that does not necessarily change my view that i wish i never had one  foreskin has a purpose for one it has more nerve endings then any other part of the skin on the penis snipping it off will reduce sexual pleasure it also keeps the glands moist and sensitive when snipped the glands always exposed and takes a more rough and dry appearance and also this is another way it reduces sensitivity when having sex it often takes a minute or two to get it in this is an unnecessary waste of time which also sort of ruins the moment that would not be needed if i had a foreskin which acts as a lubricant allowing it to slide in with ease rather then inserting a bare gland that is also dried out  the fact it decreases risk of infection and some stds i do not think it is worth the cost which is essentially reducing sexual pleasure i will never know how it feels to have a true orgasm the way it was supposed to feel  guys who get circumcised as adults report a major decrease in pleasuresensations some saying it went from a 1010 to a 210 for those of us who were cut at birth we have nothing to compare it to and because we enjoy sex or fapping its easy to say it works its fine but really this is one dimensional thinking and we do not know what we are missing out say they did not get reduced pleasure but i think that is because some have a hard time admitting it they paid into it and did something they can not take back the nerves to not lie and most nerves in the skin are in the foreskin the most sensitive part of my penis is what little skin there is left its where 80 of all the sensitivity is i could only imagine how much im missing out on since most of the skin there is gone  apparently because its more hygienic and reduces risk of infection someone else decided i do not need that foreskin made the decision against my will and consent it should be banned  this is a footnote from the cmv moderators wed like to remind you of a couple of things firstly please read through our rules if you see a comment that has broken one it is more effective to report it than downvote it speaking of which downvotes dont change views any questions or concerns feel free to message us happy cmving,1,447,2595,90,0.044444444444444446

cmv mormonism is jesus christ fanfiction,"ill admit that i am not that knowledgeable about the history of mormonism so i am open to my mind being changed that said when compared to other popular sects of christianity is relatively young and a new world religion it has no direct lineage to any other form of mainstream christianity due to the nature of its founding it draws inspiration from the bible and creates an alternative history and timeline of events in the same way a fan might draw inspiration from a popular work of fiction and create new scenarios for the characters  despite being based on the teachings for christ is not a christian in the traditional sense of the religion similar to how muslims are not considered christian even though they believe in jesus christ and regard him as a central figure in the foundation of islam mormonism has its own prophets and as previously mentioned the history of christianity under mormonism deviates completely from the biblical cannon   is not say anything bad about mormons i harbor no illwill towards the religion and i mean no offense i do not mean to belittle the religion so i apologize in advance if my tone comes off as confrontational i do not mean to imply that there is anything wrong about mormonism or that other sects of christianity are by any means correct i have no skin in the game so
 i never thought this question would get this much traction i have posted cmvs before and they never really got much attention so i am a little overwhelmed by the response  wish i could respond to everyone who took the time to respond i must admit that i didnt put too much thought into my post before making it i was literally standing at my refrigerator looking for something to eat and the idea mormonism is jesus christ fanfiction popped into my head and i wrote out my initial impressions to the idea  have since had my mind changed multiple times and will post the arguments below i appreciate all the feedback and i realize that this is a controversial issue so the respect that i have seen i havent gone through the whole thread is very impressive for the internet the arguments are repeating themselves and i have already changed my mind but i am still open new viewpoints and frankly i find the discussion fascinating im glad the question was well received and hope no one was offended by my comments gotten responses from mormons exmormons roman catholics edgy atheists and probably one or two bots for me all christian religions are fanfiction is the argument that won me over since jesus christ himself did not establish a church good job edgy atheists it was his followers who wrote the books of the new testament i also must acknowledge the fact that from a mormon perspective mormonism is the one true religion with the closest links to the teachings of christ im not saying i believe that to be true but in their narrative christ does have a direct link to the new world and belongs under the umbrella of christianity  are lot of great counter arguments presented against the above but i am not necessarily here to determine what is correct so much as i wanted my mind changed on that specific statement what is spiritually right or wrong is subjective to me and i avoid judging other peoples faithwell i guess i few all faith as the same  i think it doesnt matter what you believe as long as you are a good person and treat others with the kindness and respect christ talked about i do not consider myself a christian or religious in the traditional sense but i do think if we all tried to be a little bit more like christ we could fix a lot of the worlds problems  cmv awarded

cmv there should be no separate minimum wage for waiters or tipped employees and tipping should not be a social expectation in pretty much every dining situation  other places where tips are expected as a given waiters  others should get paid a fair market wage by employers,i dont think its good or right to have a lower than regular minimum wage for any profession there should just be one minimum wage in each city regardless of job think that waiters hairdressers valets and other professions who have a tipping expectation should just be paid a fair market wage paid by their employers and there should be no pressure or expectation of tips from pretty much every customer tips would come every so often from customers who feel that service was particularly awesome and who will want to reward that amazing service with a tip it is now i think its wrong toward the employee to pay them less than minimum wage before tips are factored in i think its currently wrong toward the customer to make the customer feel pressured to leave tips for just basic service that should really be part of the food or the haircut you paid for after all even as it is now if i paid for food that food should be available to me to eat it and if i paid for a haircut someone should be cutting my hair yet all kinds of tipping expectations are thrown around on top of these things just for me basically getting those things that i paid for so take away separate minimum wage increase the prices a little bit to provide employees a fair market wage for the job and be done with it every once in a while when someone goes above and beyond i can tip them because i feel like doing it not because of a societal pressure to do it for no reason current system creates unnecessary stress and discomfort,1,282,1569,286,0.02097902097902098
cmv senior citizens 65 should be required to retake the driving test periodically,the title basically says it all i don’t have an exact number as to how frequently they should have to retake the test maybe once every 2 years but i think something needs to be done i don’t remember the exact statistic but i remember seeing a sign in the dmv that said something along the lines of “a teen texting and driving has the same reaction time as an 80 year old” that’s crazy you’re telling me that an 80 year old has the samesimilar reaction time as someone who’s not even looking at the road half the time the teen can put the phone away but an 80 year old can’t stop being old these people took the driving test so long ago it’s surprising to me this isn’t already a law cars have changed a lot since the 50’s as has the amount of people on the roads also some of these elderly folks could be suffering from some sort of degenerative disease that could greatly affect their response time and overall competency level in my personal experience individuals with dementia or alzheimer’s are typically unaware or in denial of their condition and will continue to drive despite obviously lacking the skills to do so safely and effectively requiring them to retake the exam periodically would likely result in fewer accidents as well as ensure their safety,1,230,1286,85,0.047058823529411764

cmv as an american i shouldnt be obligated to participate in the national anthem as a display to prove my allegiance to my country,if you asked the average american how they feel about participating in the national anthem i think your average person would say that they couldnt be bothered by it all you do is stand when they ask you stand take off your hat place your hand over your heart face the flag and to keep doing it for another minute and a half what exactly does our national anthem symbolize well it symbolizes freedom some say at the same time others will tell you that by participating in the anthem you are paying tribute to our troops or to those who lost their lives defending our flag and its values some will say its a culmination of the two and then a couple other things and then there are the people who have no idea to what the hell the anthem is supposed to mean and stand there out of mere social compliance the last scenario is particularly concerning because not only are there people blindly pledging their allegiance to ideals theyre oblivious to but some people do it simply to avoid being ostracized by the more radically patriotic members of our society i find this particularly irritating first issue which ive already touched upon is not everyone can definitively agree on what or what not the anthem represents id argue that often times the anthem is a projection of an individuals own subjective opinion of what they believe it represents not every american looks through the same lens some people love america because of its opportunities others for its values its ideologies its culturethe list goes on the fact that we all have our own reasons to why we love or even hate america means that standing or kneeling for the national anthem is going to bear different levels of significance for different people second issue which is the more important issue at hand is that refusing to participate in the national anthem is seen as abhorrent unpatriotic behavior some people go as far as saying that by not participating in the national anthem that you somehow hate america really youre telling me that by not going through the mundane motions of the same old songanddance that ive done a thousand times that i hate my own country maybe you could argue that im not a true patriot in the traditional sense and probably thats true but id argue that my right to choose whether or not i wish to participate in the anthem is the epitome of american values you think about america the term freedom probably comes to the forefront but for me that isnt always the case often i feel our social and cultural atmosphere dictates a vast amount of our behaviors in ways we are unaware of and in some caseslike the one im trying to highlightcan impede on our individual liberties i shouldnt be harassed just because i dont want to participate in what feels like an outdated almost cultlike tradition as a child going through primary school it always seemed odd to me that i had to pledge my allegiance to a piece of fabric every single morning before class could even begin it wasnt until around middle school that i had finally decided i was no longer going to participate in the strange ritual i remember the first time a teacher of mine noticed me protesting the pledge she stopped the entire class just to scold me and try to force me to participate when i refused i was immediately punished and given detention the idea that i was being punished for not participating in the obsessive utterance of these words was ludicrous to me even as a twelveyearold in spite of this my contentious behavior on the matter continued throughout my high school years and along the entire way i was met with friction by my teachers enforcing me to participate now this behavior was admittedly partially due to my rebellious disposition at the time but mostly the idea that i had to align myself to a certain set of values and then pledge my socalled allegiance to said values felt inherently wrong to me this begs the question is there such a thing as forcedpatriotism and does it inhibit our individual liberties i think it does but not it ways that are obvious this idea of patriotism is imposed on us at such an early age that we become indoctrinated into this artificial ideal where we often go through the motions without truly thinking about why we do them now im not saying that if you participate in the national anthem to show your patriotism that youre some brainwashed drone blindly adhering to an outdated tradition if the national anthem has meaning to you and participating in it brings you joy then by all means do it insert shia labeouf here but dont insist that i adhere to an idea that i dont believe in as that is the most unamerican thing you could do to a person,1,838,4833,134,0.04477611940298507

cmv i see no reason why mens and womens chess are separate events,"sure sex segregation makes a lot of sense for many sportsgames where men might have an advantage due to physiological differences chess is purely mental there is no need for strength speed endurance or any other physiological parameter that would give men an advantage fact some women do compete successfully in top flight tournaments with men something that would be impossible in physical sports

 anything it seems that women only chess events are sexist because the implication is that women are not as smart as men totality of several posts convinced me that women only events maybe needed for now as a kind of a remedial measure for countering many years of men dominance in chess and the fact that currently women are underrepresented in chess i still believe that an eventual goal should be complete sex equality in chess tournaments",1,141,943,69,0.057971014492753624

cmv this statement by nadal on gender pay gap makes perfect sense,so the following conversation is being ascribed to rafael nadal as a part of some interview “in tennis should women earn as much as men” “it’s a comparison we shouldn’t even make female models earn more than male models and nobody says anything why because they have a larger following in tennis too who gathers a larger audience earns more” is an english translation of a statement printed in an italian language magazine for an interview that probably happened in spanish so its quite possible his actual statement was not the same me this statement makes perfect sense if maria sharapova or serena williams attract more viewers or are able to sell more expensive tickets than andy murray they should get more money  no question about it to me it seems like feminists want to push for equality in places where they are at a disadvantage but want to do nothing about situations where they are at an advantage are likely to be paid more or are more likely to be hired in the first place models porn stars massage therapists hospitality industry jobs and so on some feminists i follow whose views i otherwise respect are unhappy with the statement without specifying any valid reason love to hear the other side of the story on this one this blew up way beyond my ability to handle all your replies the only consensus seems to be that the quote in isolation is not wrong but the broader issue of gender pay gap is anything but this simple the examples of us womens soccer and ufc were enlightening and something i didnt know previously ill try to keep the existing conversation threads going on for as long as i can but im too exhausted to engage with the newer ones thanks everyone for replying hell of a first cmv experience ,1,311,1823,66,0.07575757575757576
cmv good people who hold racist ideas are not automatically evil but they are by definition racists,"the classic example of this would be a person’s grandparents that grew up in a different time where it was not considered a bad thing to classify and ultimately look down on a person based on their perceived racial category many of not most of the time this person has had limited sustained contact with people of other races and is at times arrogantly used to making broad statements about members of certain racial categories most people people don’t have any problems referring their grandparents as racists their way of thinking didn’t and doesn’t automatically prevent them from being a good parent spouse grandparent citizen etc  difficulty today is that people are unwilling to come to terms with the fact that they have racist beliefs often inherited from older generations that can subtly and not so subtly come out in their interactions with people of different races racist to them equal someone that is evil and it feels bad to be labeled that way  being a racist is a negative quality that many otherwise good people have being racist can and does cause harm to others and people should be proactive in changing their racist beliefs as a method of self improvement there certainly are evil people who maliciously harbor racial hatred against others that are racists too we often consider them more representative of the term racist than your grandparents or instance but this is just a matter of degree  a person calls you a racist there is always the possibility that they are right this should be an opportunity for self reflection rather than an automatic denial

cmv social media channels should remove publicized number of “likes” on postspicturestweets,i love being able to connect with others and having the opportunity to network on these platforms however i believe publicizing the number of likes on a post or picture does more harm than good i believe that social media users would benefit from not having number of likes on their posts be public but these analytics could still be seen by the individual a tweet from kanye west on 20 sep 2018 he posted “we should be able to participate in social media without having to show how many followers or likes we have just like how we can turn off the comments we should be able to turn off the display of followers this has an intense negative impact on our self worth” think where kanye is coming from is that seeing the number of likes on social media can lead to comparing your stats to others which can cause a negative impact on one’s mental wellbeing while research does state receiving “likes” is associated with increased brain activity that makes you feel good about yourself  i couldn’t find much literature or research on the outcomes of removing public ‘like’ numbers from social media i believe people should still be able to see their likes on a post but this number shouldn’t have to be public for others don’t understand why the social media platforms don’t give users the option to hide their analytics from others in my opinion it does not benefit anyone knowing how many likes another person has compared to how many you have… i just feel like individuals should have the chose to make their numbers private some comments mention websitesplatforms such as youtube  which i do see the functionality and use of likesdislikes however i was thinking more in terms of facebook instagram and twitter where these numbers are just on display to everyone  for all the great comments  responses,1,321,2078,94,0.0425531914893617
cmv we should no longer be buried in cemeteries or caskets when we die,"from what i understand caskets or coffins were used to keep the body locked in when people thought they might possibly come back from the dead and crawl their way back up to the surface as some type of zombie also to stop grave robbers from stealing organs or items that the deceased was buried with 
it seems completely insane to me to spend thousands of dollars on a wooden box just to be buried 6 feet under never to be seen again then spend another few thousand dollars on a gravestone and another on a plot in a cemetery if everyone chooses to be buried like this the whole planet would eventually be one giant cemetery 
being buried in a casket with a gravestone marking your spot seems completely selfish to me not only because the fact that the thousands of dollars spent could have gone to better use but i️ feel like the majority of people take from the planet more than they try to preserve it the least we could do when we die is be buried without a box and let the nutrients from our remains go back into the earth or get cremated and have our ashes spread somewhere having a gravestone above your burial site makes it seem like you want to be remembered as someone important we’re only here for a short time it is up to us to choose the legacy we are going to leave behind some people will be remembered for a very long time through generations and others will be remembered by only a few the life we choose to live will determine that 
i’m not saying that only some people deserve to be remembered but that’s just how it is out of the billions of people on this planet a very small percentage will be remembered for a decent amount of time but for some reason some people think they can have a permanent spot on this planet as humans we’re no better than any other species trying to survive here 
i think we should be past this idea of being buried in an expensive box in a little area of a cemetery with a fancy gravestone taking up space ",1,373,1984,72,0.05555555555555555
cmv kneeling for the anthem does not disrespect the usa,"i say this as a canadian who has been following the anthem protests relatively closely usa is not a flag the usa is not a song usa is a collection of thoughts and ideals among which three are central  everyone should be treated equallyfairly  the government is not perfect  if you dont like something you have the right to voice your displeasure sometimes with weapons kneeling before a flag during a song which isnt your nation but exercising your belief in the ideas that are your nation is not disrespectful of the nation but your disrespecting the people who fought and died for that flag they fought and died for the flag moreso than they did foe the ideals which it is supposed to represent then i would argue they deserve the disrespect they are disrespecting a nation which has given them those rights therefore using those rights should come before paying lipservice to a flag which represents things you dont agree with that would change my view that the flag anthem and government should be more important than those listed ideals
 that those listed ideals are wrong
 that kneeling is not a good form of protest  apparently i need to point out that i awarded a delta  i awarded a delta it is disrespectful but the disrespect makes sense",1,225,1348,56,0.14285714285714285
cmvyou should be able to sue lenders and banks for issuing credit to an identity thief impersonating you thus ruining your credit score,"let me restate that  you should be able to successfully sue the bank or anyone else giving them credit in your name only makes sense to steal an identity when the thief gets something out of it  a useless identification is not worth the trouble  so if a bank or lender gives an identity thief credit in your name you should be able to successfully sue the bank for not doing due diligence to ensure they are really dealing with you side effect of this would be more inperson transactions and more personalized service which may be slightly slower or cost slightly more but the results would be well worth it for society as institutions would be forced to get to know their clients a little more and identity theft would be reduced as thieves knew they couldnt use your credit from afar many people havr given good answers and mentioned how secure loans are  if thats the case why are so many identities sill stolen if its very tough to get a benefit frim the theft why do it

cmv apple is a deceptive company that relies primarily on brand image to sell its overpriced products,apple inc used to be a pioneer of technology in the late 20th century with the macintosh computer and ipod devices but today they have become a company that relies on inferior rehashes of old technology that they deem as innovative and market for much more than what they are actually worth  prime example is the iphone 7 and its missing 35mm headphone jack removing a smartphone component and replacing it with wireless earbuds that are much easier to misplace and requiring the user to purchase a separate lightningto35mm adapter that costs 10 and is described as fragile and poorly made one could say that this is intentional and forces the user to spend more money to replace these parts once they break or are lost  lets look at the software mac os is exclusive to apple products which forces me to pick up one of their 2000 macbooks if i want to even touch their operating system people often say that mac is better for developers than windows but having used windows os x and linux i can say with certainty that os x is the least capable of the three the amount of available software that can run on os x is minimal compared to windows for developers linux is superior with greater customization and an enormous online community for help as opposed to having to contact apple tech support and the best part linux is free between hardware and software is also an issue apple has specifically designed it such that their devices will only function with their equipment want to add some songs to your iphone better open up itunes need a new cable time to go the apple store people will still buy it because its apple after all they want to walk around with their fancy white earbuds and their applebranded bottles and tshirts the company has done such a great job at establishing their brand image over the last few decades that they can send out overpriced mediocre products and still make money people are so distracted by the brand that they fail to see this apple knows that they will always have dedicated consumers who throw money at them and as a result they no longer feel the need to innovate when they can recycle the same concepts year after year  after reading some responses probably the one that changed my view the most was that if a person sees an item as being valuable they are justified in spending money on it in this case the demand for an apple product is not so much the brand image as it is the perceived uses of the product from the perspective of that person therefore it is not overpriced if people are willing to pay that much for it  these comments have provided some new perspective for me i probably wont get through all the responses but you can consider my view at least somewhat changed  this is a footnote from the cmv moderators wed like to remind you of a couple of things firstly please read through our rules if you see a comment that has broken one it is more effective to report it than downvote it speaking of which downvotes dont change views any questions or concerns feel free to message us happy cmving,1,560,3410,103,0.038834951456310676
cmv popularizing and perhaps enforcing a 3 day or 24 hours in total workweek or preferably even less would only be beneficial to humanity as a whole,this is one ive been thinking about for a bit just to clarify things it isnt the 5day workweek in particular that ive got a problem with its the idea of working more than 2025 hours a week in total regardless of when its actually worked ive got for my view solves the job crisis unemploymentunderemployment were current having it encourages job growth by potentially restricting the amount of work that employees can actually do simplistic example but if a bank needs a teller for 6 days of the week but each worker is only able to work 3 that effectively creates another job increased productivity this is one for the employers most people are actually incredible ineffective when made to work solid 8 hour blocks i understand there are generally smaller breaks within that we are much more effective working shorter more intense 6090 minute breaks before periods of rest if we werent expected to work on average 40 hrs a week with the only feasible way to do that being 95equivalent there could be more opportunity for employers to allow employees to change the way they work particularly in white collar work more freetime improve general wellbeingmental health the majority of the population dont really like to work its seen as something we have to suffer through so we can enjoy ourselves on the weekendpursue hobbies in our spare time so why do we spend so much time doing it with food so plentiful and only a relatively small amount of people needed to work to produce it we have no real need to work so hard all were really doing is supporting a consumerist culture that many scientists would tell you doesnt actually make you any happier ease the potential crisis of automationsmarter ai this is a big one for me already were starting to reach the point where millions upon millions of humans may become irrelevant in the economy selfdriving carstrucks just to name one example were already considering concepts like ubi the 5 day work week will effectively become impossible for most in the next 50 or so years anyway  why not get ahead of a potential catastrophe for once and make changes thatll make things easier in the long run criticisms i can envisionthings im unsure on that might lead to a change in view economic impact individual and macro again as money is ultimately a human invention and because our basic needs in western cultures at least can be cared for regardless i dont see why this idea cant work maybe some would argue that people wouldnt be paid enough to live but why not if everyone was limited to 24 hours of work demand for things still set at the prices relative to the 40 hour work week would fall and force everyone to set new prices that the new workforce could actually afford even if this is an issue dont we have to tackle it anyway fairly soon with automation around the corner maybe an ubi based on increased taxes on companies could add to peoples incomes it would lead to offshoring of business where regulations wouldnt exist maybe this is a valid point but i feel it exists outside the view i want changed ultimately were going to have to get stricter on big companies regardless because of increasing automation enforcement im ambivalent on whether this should actually be enforced or merely greater efforts made to popularize i on one hand enforcement may bring with it a whole host of other challenges business ownersselfemployed specialized people who have to work longer weeks but on the other hand i feel it may have to be enforced simply because otherwise the motivation to work longer and screw everyone else in the process will always be there much of the world seems to be infatuated with this idea of a 5day workweek or even more than those 40 hours and sometimes i feel a little out there on my own with this view which makes me question whether its right or wrong so im interested in opposing viewpoints change my view so my view has been changed to an extent i still believe in an abstract thought experiment kind of way that a society built around a 3 day workweek would be better than what we have now this has though highlighted to me that the only feasible way to achieve it would be to reduce production and for many thats extremely undesirable andor impossible because of desire to maintain our current state of livingconsumerismdesire for progressinnovation etc we likely would struggle at least shortterm to fill all the jobs we currently have which while not a problem for some areas could make getting the basic necessities of life difficult  feel a 4 day workweek is significantly more feasible and is something that could be achieved right now without such a dramatic reduction in production thanks for the discussion,1,828,4932,157,0.025477707006369428

cmv the electoral college is dumb antidemocratic and doesnt even accomplish any of the outcomes its supporters claim are its purpose,"1 people claim the electoral college prevents california texas and new york from determining the outcome of the presidential election it is only under the electoral college that states vote as blocks more people voted for donald trump in los angeles 620285 than voted at all in alaska 246588 and wyoming 248742 combined their votes were switched and discounted  ignoring that states dont vote as a block voters in those three states dont account for half of the voters in the country even if everyone who voted in those three states in 2016 decided to vote for the same person it would only have been 27903726 votes 2255 of the total voter turnout nowhere near enough to decide the outcome  you want voters in small states to have a bigger voice than voters in large states giving their votes a multiplier would be much fairer if people in wyoming just had their vote counted 373 or whatever times as much as californian votes at least under that system dissenting votes within a state would be counted how they are cast instead of being switched you could apportion the voting power multiplier by an index of population per congressperson with whatever state was lowest set as 1 vote or you could apportion it by a simple formula based on population ranking like this multiplier  state population rank  19  20 i do not advocate for this type of system either one vote per person is fundamentally more fair people claim that under a popular vote system candidates would ignore everywhere but the most populous areas under the current system candidates only have an incentive to campaign in swing states how is that any better than the imagined problem of candidates only campaigning in populous areas for example if hillary clinton could have changed 73515 minds in florida and arizona in 2016 she would have won the whole election on the other hand convincing 100000 trump voters in idaho to switch their vote would have gained her nothing 375 out of 399 campaign events in 2016 took place in just 12 states half of all states had no candidate events during the presidential election not counting primaries which are a whole other unrelated issue under a system with one person one vote candidates would campaign anywhere they felt they could persuade voters to vote for them that calculus would be different for every candidate certainly some candidates would campaign primarily in populous centers but that would not be a winning strategy for other candidates consider the state of illinois it has a gigantic liberal city in it that accounts for about 75 percent of the states population despite that in 2014 they elected a republican governor who carried every county but one cook 40 percent of population now do you think that candidate campaigned solely in chicago why then would a candidate who truly wanted to represent rural america campaign solely in cities of the 2013 census only 282 percent of people in america live in cities over 100k population even winning all of the votes in those cities wouldnt come close to winning you the election and again it is only under the electoral college where cities vote as a block 
 people say the founding fathers never intended for people to directly elect the president and that the electors were meant to make the choice independently and prevent an uneducated populous from electing a demagogue is clearly not how the system is working so their intentions dont mean anything

cmv shifting to an 18year us supreme court term would have substantial benefits that would outweigh the drawbacks,"i think we would be better off if supreme court justices were nominated to 18year terms rather than lifetime appointments  my vision for this would be that a seat would come up every other year at the beginning of oddnumbered years  if a justice were to retire from their seat or die during their 18year term a new justice could be appointed to fill the remainder of their term benefits i see of such an approach supreme court nominations become slightly lowerstakes  right now when you nominate a justice in their 40s they could conceivably serve on the bench for 40 years before dying or retiring  this makes every nomination an apocalyptic event  i dont think that issue would go away entirely with 18year terms as thats still pretty long but it would lessen the stakes somewhat supreme court nominations become more predictable  we currently live in a world where we never know when a seat will come up to be filled before scalias death we had 4 justices who could decide to retire or come into illhealth at any moment breyer ginsburg kennedy scalia raising the possibility that one president could potentially reshape the judiciary dramatically if heshe got lucky  edit as an added benefit the phenomenon of scotus justices deciding whether to wait out certain presidents they dont like or retire under presidents they do like would go away which i think is a good thing more democratic responsiveness in the supreme court the prevailing philosophy on the court can and does change over time but it can take a very long time for that to happen with lifetime tenure and the role luck plays in the timing of scotus openings  with more predictable openings if the public spends 10 years pushing for the court to move in one direction through their votes in elections they can actually reshape the court  i know this is a doubleedged sword because in theory the court isnt always considered an institution that is supposed to be particularly democratically responsive removing scotus battles from election cycles if you could have the vacancies occur at the beginning of every oddnumbered year they would be as far from the next election as possible diminishing as far as possible the incentive to wait until an election before confirming a justice  and every time people went to the polls they would know that their vote was directly impacting a scotus nomination within the next few months less disincentive to nominating older judges not that nominating young judges is a bad thing necessarily but because of the stakes of lifetime appointments there is a big incentive to look for really young justices rather than necessarily the best person to fill the role  in todays world its impossible to imagine nominating a justice who is 60 or 65 years old because you could be giving up 1015 years of their service on the back end relative to a justice who is 4550  with an 18year term politicians would have more flexibility to choose slightly older and more experienced justices if they wished know this would require a constitutional amendment and i know that will never happen but i wanted to float it as at least a thought experiment  what am i missing  cmv

cmv death penalties should not exist because the possibility of killing an innocent man outweigh the benefits of executing a criminal,how do you know with 100 certainty that a person has committed the crime that he is being accused of even if all the forensic equipment the dna testing print gathering and witnesses the possibility that all the signs pointing towards an innocent person being the culprit of a major crime is still possible the hair found on the crime scene can be purposefully placed the prints found on the murder weapon might be a coincidence the witness that claims to have seen this person commit the crime is under a lot of pressure and his memory has failed him he believes that what he saw was true but it isnt remember reading about a case where they arrested a woman that worked at a qtip factory because some of her dna got to the qtips used by the police article not the same one i red but its the same case are people that confess to crimes they didnt commit and get paid to go to jail some mental illnesses can be used to make a person believe they did something they didnt can always be some piece of the puzzle missing or some slight chance that the person being executed is not the real culprit i am not wrong there are around 50 countries that still practice death penalties and i would like to know why is it taking so long to get rid of this inhumane practice tried to not bring up the argument that it is straight up inhumane which it is but furthermore it is illogical to give a permanent punishment to a person that we arent sure is the culprit 100 and we can never be was a similar discussion made about death penalties like 7 months ago but the reasons op gave against death penalties were different this blew up so much i cant keep up and there are so many interesting debates and philosophical points of view im loving it and my brain is overloading from all the thinking thanks for commenting and i hope i can respond to everything a video was sent to me by another user that explains my points and many more against death penalty more thoroughly and professionally than me link ,1,375,2173,135,0.02962962962962963
cmv workplace cafeterias should not make a profit,im not very knowledgeable about the topic but worked in a hospital cafeteria in high school the food they served to staff and guests was and still is extremely overpriced and they always made moves to cut staff hours in favor of profit  even when those extra staff members were helpful dont companies already make enough money from other areas i feel they should charge lower prices for food rather than making money from employees and guests may be convinced of the argument for making enough money for shipping supplies paying cafeteria workers etc even then it seems those expenses could come from other areas instead of from the companys own staff in my experience however most workplaces try to make a profit from selling their food not just pay necessary expenses cmv reddit thanks everyone for your replies ill try to respond to you all as soon as i can sorry for poor wording i didnt mean to say say food should be free for employees in the post just at a reduced price to not make a profit then if food prices truly needed to be high to keep the cafeteria budget neutral maybe it would be possible to pull profit from other areas in order to provide employees with lower priced food these were my original thoughts hope thats more clear now thanks for the great discussion,1,231,1335,51,0.0784313725490196
cmv the leftright political spectrum is a largely useless classification system that does more harm than good,"politics and its related topics are an exceedingly multidimensional space and our obsession with mapping people and organizations to an approximate coordinate on a single dimensional scale does more to obfuscate our convictions and beliefs than it does to help identify them in addition to being insufficient as a classifier it imparts undue baggage due to spectrum proximity with unrelated views as an example if i am a strong proponent of states rights and individual responsibility then these convictions would be more typically associated with rightwing politics and therefore i would occupy a place on the spectrum that is closer to extremeright views like say white nationalism
 on the other hand if im in favor of amnesty for large swaths of undocumented immigrants then this conviction would be more typically associated with leftwing politics and so now im positioned closer to ultraleft views like say marxism
 but lets say i hold both of the above views when ive actually expressed both of these opinions before ive been accused of political centering as though the only option we have left is to average it out because darn it if we dont somehow reduce it all back down to a single dimension again above are obviously just specific examples and perhaps not the best ones but the root of my view here is that despite the ubiquitous usage of the leftright spectrum i find that it doesnt accurately indicate which positions are held by an individual
 can implicitly suggest positions that arent held by an individual

cmv people should stop focusing on “useless degrees” and instead focus on the fact that the job market is full of meaningless arbitrary and unfulfilling jobs,"i study a classic useless liberal arts degree at a fancy institution and i’ve become very accustomed to the scoffs and jokes about my “unemployable” future i know i’ve accepted it i used to get a lot of anxiety about this stuff worrying about my life 5 years from now i used to wonder if there’s something wrong with me for wanting to put a gun to my head after looking at the kind of internships grad roles and training schemes that are available most of them are boring financial services roles consulting jobs that involve useless administrative tasks pr work and more then i read some of this book called “bullshit jobs” by david graeber and it really did encapsulate everything i have secretly believed about the job force for much of my life so far no matter how many people tell me “smart students will go onto work smart jobs in banking or law or the civil service” i cannot help agreeing with graeber that most of these jobs actually have close to zero impact on society and even sometimes only have a more negative impact on the world a lot of them involve tasks that are filled with useless word jumbo snoozefest meetings and days where you sit in an office watching youtube while pretending go to work  remember doing a short consulting work experience thing and thinking the idea of change management seemed like the perfect example of a job that’s been invented just so some pretendsmart person could get paid  did creativity suddenly mean suffering”  graeber is where my view on useless degrees come in yes i know so many degrees are completely inapplicable to jobs and cost way too much money but why does studying something that is ultimately still fascinating and important to some aspect of society  like classical civilisations or anthropology or film or literature mean you’re just some dumb pretentious young person who’s wasting your life i totally understand the more practical importance of stem degrees but even having a biology degree nowadays will have you struggling to make ends meet unless you go into finance or marketing or whatever
 just wanna say that i think the fact that people have to pay thousands for some degrees that won’t guarantee a good income to pay back student loans and such is a huge problem that should be addressed in the future what i mean is that the actual existence of these degrees or the knowledge you get from them shouldn’t be degraded because the job market’s problems are probably worse change management is an example i thought of myself that i now see may be incorrect but in the actual book graeber gives many other examples not change management but mentions titles like “human resources consultant”",1,469,2734,159,0.025157232704402517
cmv i have never seen an argument against net neutrality that shows knowledge or understanding of how the internet works so give me one,okay now that all the mainstream hype over this is over lets get real here i get started if you dont feel knowledgeable enough to make a case against net neutrality but want to see a debate please upvote so people who are knowledgeable can see this and make their case against itno offence but i thing we all deserve to heresee people who know what they are talking about ie network technicians serverclient programmers etc discussing this issue dont get me wrong i like seeing people taking interest in a field that i am in but after a while the misinformation starts to pile on and it gets cringe worthy real quick those of you who dont know how data works regarding computers of course  lets me briefly explainall data that is transferred over the internet in converted into bytesor 8 bits for the tech savvy what is bytes  thats not important what is important is that everything video text music etc everything is converted into bytes  and heres the really important part 1 bytes takes up the same amount of space no matter what it represents  thus 1 byte of video takes up the same amount of space as 1 byte of text all the people who did basic computer scienceinformation technology let that sink in real good i cant make this stuff up there are literally people stating like its fact video data takes up more bandwidth than text data if you have a data plan that allows to 1 byte per second it would take you 1 second to download the video and 1 second to download the text also that 1 byte would cost isps the same amount to transfer  okay so now i know what youre thinking what if people send more videos 10 more videos to be exactat the same time and to that i say well to send more videosat the same time you need more bandwidth 10 bytes worth more worth of bandwidth to be exact note i didnt say you need 10 more bytes worth of video bandwidth    because as you know  1 byte per whatever takes up the same amount of space  so all you need is 10 more bytes worth of bandwidth heres what isp want to doisps want to sell us   video bandwidth music bandwidth email bandwidth etc  instead of just selling us bandwidth and letting us do what we want with our bandwidth the only reason for trying to sell us different types of bandwidth is to trick us into paying them more and the reason i said trick is because bandwidth doesnt work that was  this is fact server doesnt see 1 byte of video and say oh boy this is gonna take up more space because videos are heavy better get ready  because a server doesnt even know a video is inside that byte because it doesnt need to know isps are trying to trick people who dont know how the internet works into paying them more they are doing this by incorrectly describing how data in transferred over the internet but people are too blinded by politics to see it is more important that anything to me if you have any view that you think may be of value here please share i am not beyond learning and i am really interested in other peoples view on topics like this,1,582,3330,138,0.10144927536231885
cmv i don’t believe in saying the pledge in school,i’m an american high schooler and like most we say the pledge second period day after day almost none of the students actually say it at least out loud i am among those many i often question “what if i don’t want to pledge allegiance to the ‘republic’ what if i feel america is rapidly declining and i no longer believe in what the government and america stand for” its hard for me to see how to interpret this in any other way i also dislike the part about “one nation under god” this strikes me as odd because who’s to say america is “under god”  even under any gods if any at all i thought the government wasn’t supposed to promote any specific religion finally “liberty and justice for all” i don’t believe there is justice for all or at least not “just” justice there are so many court cases where for example a black person is treated unjustly in modern day america i just don’t see why we say the pledge anymore if in my opinion it is so wrong people aren’t even thinking about what they are saying anymore i just want a different perspective,1,199,1082,52,0.23076923076923078
cmv masculinity is not toxic being a polite but masculine man comes naturally to most men and should not be treated as a threat,i am a 35yearold finnish straight man living in finland i have also lived in sweden during 20102015 i am married with kids i would consider my wife as a pragmatic feminist and as such probably myself as well albeit with the problem regarding what counts as equality i have not faced issues in this field until very recently as this neoprogressive phenomenon related to pc and terminology has landed in daily life in finland me tell you a story i was raised by my mother a hard working single parent dad was an absent alcoholic who taught me most values about life obviously this doesnt mean she was a feminist but i would consider her as a pragmatic seeker for an effective process towards synergy she felt rightly so that men and women are inherently different mentally biologically etc which obviously meant there would always be dynamic differences still believe this in my 30s after doing my own studies and after learning even more from my wife who is a teacher doesnt mean there should be any inequality but it doesnt mean there should be forced equality either to my topic i have never bumped into this argument in my life in the nordics we have a pretty equal society women have been a part of commerce politics and academia for a long time and excluding a few cases harrasment nor discrimination has not been common i have been harrassed more than i have heard of women being harrassed obviously it happens in my circle of friends lately i have been told by young women not to mansplain not to manspread and a friend of mine caused a stranger crying and shaking after asking her albeit in a slightly drunken way how was her evening in a bar we were thrown out in finland because of harrasment wrong bar it was too young and trendy but still this was not obnoxius behaviour that i can say is this masculinity that is being discussed am i completely blind and oblivous to things happening as i simply cannot comprehend why younger generation has become so obsessed in the common traits which are related to being a man am apolitical although quite liberal in the nordic sense not us polite welleducated thoughtful and cannot understand i do not believe there is a phenomenon called patriarchy in the world it is absolutely manifesting itself in singular scenarios companies sure but to say i as a man am somehow faulty or toxic or dangerous as a masculine person is wrong and outright offensive 1 there obviously is a contextual issue in my terminology i think the point still remains so i will adjust my perspective a bit when reading through the replies 2 we have established the toxicity part if mods allow i would like to use this thread to still discuss the latter part of my masculinity argument 3 a lot of replies i will try to go through each and every reply and consider their value ,1,505,2959,133,0.03759398496240601
cmv the 24 hour clock military time is superior to the 12 hour clock,i think my reasoning on this one is fairly self explanatory i feel that it is unnecessarily confusing to refer to the 13th hour of the day as 1 oclock pm i feel like the concepts of am and pm are dated and probably originated from a time where humans were much more dependent on natural sunlight to be productive with the advent of artificial light noon is no longer really the middle of the workday so i see no reason to reset the clock and start counting from one again every time we hit noon if the clock just reset at 24 oclock each night it would just be a more sensible less confusing system,1,116,607,72,0.05555555555555555
i believe that we should have a reverse boot camp when veterans return from active duty in order to better transition them back into society cmv,so from my limited understanding of this ive read that ptsd and depression just two examples are reaching ridiculous levels of diagnosis it would seem that coming back from the events of war causes significant changes in ones mental state and that transitioning back to society is extremely difficult even for the soldiers who are fine we know a lot of ways to combat ptsd and depression and theres new studies coming out all the time so its clearly something we as a society care about just seems to me that generally american society continually spouts the whole i support the troops mindset but what does that really mean the biggest problems that face troops dont have to do with supplies funding or a lack of training going into the conflict but their transition back into society afterwards we train them to go into the conflict why would we not train them to come out of it we know that many many troops struggle with this and we know how to treat it obviously each case is different but i mean as an overarching topic we do know treatment methods it seems like a no brainer that we should be doing something about it in my mind the best way to do this would be to have some sort of mandatory program for soldiers when they return it could be just a month or two long after which those soldiers who still need help will at least have the resources readily available to them and it would consist of living and working as a group to achieve peaceful goals possibly raising animals spending a lot of time outside etc etc even for those soldiers who arent suffering from these serious issues would benefit from some down time to reduce stress levels and transition back into everyday life ugroovyoctopus suggested possibly doing volunteer work i thought it was worth mentioning up here as well so new readers could see it money for all of this in the perfect world would come from all the excess military spending that this country pumps out if you dont believe that just google excess military spending and see what comes up final supporting point is that over half of all enlisted forces are between the ages of 1830 this means that most people who are enlisted are still relatively young and have not spent a lot of time off in the real world on their own so another argument is that since they have not spent a lot of time interacting with society as a regular citizen then they have very little to fall back on in terms of old habits or old feelings to relate to thats the thinking behind my view im really interested in reading some arguments as to why we dont already do this everyone i understand that funding might be the biggest issue people are going to raise i would prefer to hear other arguments against this because funding is the most apparenteasiest one to spot but also the easiest one to refute this whole topic was sparked in my mind over this recent this american life story skip to deep dark open secret ive already clarified in comments below so instead of posting the same thing to each reply the program would definitely provide ample time to spend with family and friends i think that the program could be structured in such a way that veterans could commute to the camp in order to preform tasks much like a 95 job it would not necessitate being away from their families for another month or two after the end of deployment  also the details of the program arent what matters so much about my post if you have suggestions about what soldiers could be doing during this reverse boot camp time id gladly hear them however my view isnt so much about what they should be doing to reintegrate but the fact that they should be doing something and that something should be organized and paid for by the military that put them in a combat zone  for anyone who wants to say that we already have programs in place like individual counseling etc i am aware of that and that is a valid point however before you post it id like you to take a look at veteran suicide rates or just google it if you dont like that article theyre out of control so it would appear that the system we have in place isnt working if you have evidence to refute that id love to read up on it  it has been brought to my attention that reintegration programs do exist in each branch of the military i guess someone thought this was a good idea before however from the descriptions ive read they sound terribly ineffective extremely dry boring no one takes them seriously etc i guess the cmv has transitioned from there should be these programs to these programs need to change thanks to everyone for their input so far ill do my best to keep replying below but at this point i guess changing my original view is impossible because these programs already exist however if people wish to keep the discussion going from where it has evolved to i believe these programs are ineffective and need to change feel free to put your input below,1,905,5984,148,0.0472972972972973

cmv us media had more effect in electing trump than the russian government,"simply put exposure  publicity
yes russian trolls exploited divisiveness in america yet that divisiveness was not created by them so much as it was fomented over decades by increasingly sensationalist journalism

yes the dnc leaks coming out just before the democratic convention divided the party but the very content of the leaks suggest that the party itself in coordination with media outlets to diminish the impact of sanders campaign

but most importantly even more problematic to what was essentially a media blackout of the sanders campaign in 2015 us media gave unprecedent favoritism to trump through sheer volume of coverage trumps empty podium alone was given 30 minutes of screen time on not just fox but cnn and msnbc
the wealth of media attention gave trump demagoguery a platform to spread russias efforts were a mere nudge in comparison

cmv people who drive loud cars and motorcycles are inconsiderate assholes,"its my view that people that drive motorcylces and cars with those loud mufflers are simply inconsiderate in that they dont care about others peace and quiet  
  
ive always found them annoying say youre reading or studying at a cafe and they roar by louder than an invading mongolian horde god forbid they stop at a light since now youre stuck listening to that ungodly chortle for a good minute or so  
  
im a single parent now and live by a fairly well travelled road they wake my baby up consistently and he has a hard time with his sleeping habits  
  
its a choice to make your vehicle that loud not a necessity on top of that the rider or driver does not have to hear his most of his own racket since most of the sound is projected backwards  
  
these people are assholes i wish i could wake them up every 15 minutes with their own stupid vehicle   
  
i had no idea this post would get this big and as much as id like to i cant possibly hope to discuss this with all of you thank you to everyone on both sides of the issue for your reasoned and very interesting replies  
  
the argument that got me closest to changing my view was surely that of safety other people are saying being loud is not as important for safety as actually driving well on a motorcycle and this seems to be coming from cyclists as well so unless i see some sort of peer reviewed study over anecdotal evidence that line of thinking isnt doing it for me
  
my favorite arguments were those along the lines of its a free country youre the one thats being inconsiderate by expecting the riders to be silent the image of some tatted up hells angel roaring through town and impinging on the hearing of 500 people and then screaming im being oppressed when someone suggests he tones down the throttle is simply delicious  a special thank you to everyone who called me a pussy via pm its good to know you care so much

utoastitothebandito did manage to change my view on this here is the link to his comment  thank you toastito and thank you for being considerate to others
  
just a caveat here theres a few comments in this thread that highlight the problem with some drivers very well im not gonna call anyone out by name but the gist is that im annoyed over a minor inconvenience and i should get over it people like driving loud cars and theyre gonna keep doing it   
  
i dont think any new parent would call it a minor inconvenience after spending 30 minutes putting a baby to sleep only to be woken up 5 minutes into his nap by a purposely loud vehicle but this post isnt just about me or my baby these drivers drive past countless people people who are gravely ill people who own dogs that will shit on the carpet because theyre scared of the sound nursing homes someone with a migraine headache people who work the night shift and all these little acts each one is a little fuck you from the driver and all these little fuck yous add up to one huge mega fuck you to your community people with empathy get mad at this not just because it inconveniences them but because they know it inconveniences many others as well and the act is seen as grossly disrespectful because of that  
  
one pm i got said  
  
i drive a loud car why because i like it  
  
he doesnt take the time to think how will my actions affect those around me is there any chance the thing i am about to do will harm someone and if that is the case should i still do the thing no this person doesnt give a shit and that ladies and gentlemen is the very essence of being inconsiderate andanasshole

 pretend that i was a boss two people are held for an interview one person is rumored to have a terrible personality the other person isnt talked about given similar specs i would hire the person without those rumors is it possible that they were false rumors of course but i dont care about justice it is more convenient for me to just choose someone without those circumstances regardless of the truth there is no point in me sorting through their drama when there is a much easier alternative  me most people live their lives under the assumptions that our acquaintances would not lie to us and that makes sense if you think otherwise please cmv clarifying that i am referring to reasonable beyond all doubts as a criteria for proof strictly in legal sense my personal accounts of that person or testimonials would not suffice as evidence  clarified people this is a footnote from the cmv moderators wed like to remind you of a couple of things firstly please read through our rules if you see a comment that has broken one it is more effective to report it than downvote it speaking of which downvotes dont change views any questions or concerns feel free to message us happy cmving",1,371,2315,101,0.0594059405940594
cmv supporters of president trump should not be mocked or ignored if democrats want to win elections,"for the record i grew up in a small conservative town and many of my relatives regrettably voted for trump im what some on the right might stereotype as a liberal coastal elite live in a coastal metropolis have graduate degree have worked in media appreciate science and good grammar the election ive seen a subset of liberals  many of my friends included  go on to denounce all trump supporters as insert pejorative here who should not be engaged with on any level because you cant reason with stupid im paraphrasing here but you get the gist this same group often mocks things like blue collar jobs flyover states agricultural work and those without college degrees  me this perspective feeds the narrative promulgated by the political right rnc fox news etc of the democratic partyliberals being out of touchelitistunable to help the common man in my mind it is crucial that we engage with trump voters in a way that 1 makes them feel heard and 2 addresses issues important to them  ignoring or calling trump supporters names is counterproductive to the goal of electing progressivesliberalsdems into office cmv  point of clarification many seem to take my argument to mean the only way for democrats to win elections is to flip trump voters because i say it is crucial that we engage them i concede that this wording supports this conclusion but what i mean to say is that it is simply very important that we engage with trump supporters

cmv only registered organ donors should be able to receive an organ transplant or at the very least get priority on the transplant waiting list,"there is an organ shortage in many countries around the world at least those where you arent put on the organ donor list by default and must actively optout im a canadian and in canada last year there were only 500 organ donors a country of 35 million we have a severe shortage of organ donors yet so many people that need an organ to live lot of peoplein fact i feel the majority of peopletake transplantation for granted they dont give thought to the fact that if they get injured or sick and need a transplant that organ actually needs to come from somewhere someone who has given consent to donate their organ upon death its really only those who are unfortunate enough to require an organ and are sitting on the waiting list without the privilege of having a living matching donor in their life that really understand how scarce and valuable a resource organ donation is despite receiving the form at each stage of acquiring your drivers license many people just toss the form into the trash without much thought think there needs to be more awareness and information and bluntness around the issue we are going to die and we will have no use for our organs at the very least pass over your solid organs to one of the many many people who can get new life from it keep your tissues you can save up to 5 lives
 so i think that as a solution to this issue only registered organ donors should be allowed to receive an organ transplant should they fall ill or at the very least registered organ donors should be given priority above nonregistered individuals make it common knowledge make it known and there will be more people actively considering and signing up to become donors my view i didnt realize i needed to include a commonsense clause those who are ill or who would otherwise not be eligible for organ donation as well as those under the age of consent would not be included in this this is change my view not try and find superficial loopholes in my argument argue the logic argue the reasoning argue the broad statement",1,371,2138,147,0.027210884353741496
cmv subreddits shouldn’t ban redditors for subscribingparticipating in other subreddits with opposing viewpoints,here’s the roots a fellow redditor was banned from rtwoxchromosomes for subscribing to and commenting within rpussypassdenied with the explanation that the redditor was participating in subreddits with posts and subscribers that are majority misogynistic and against what rtwoxchromosomes stands for the ban emphasized that the redditor could still view rtwoxchromosomes postscomments but could not participate actively my reaction was frustration which transitioned to disappointment however being human i understand that sometimes my initial reactions are not the most accurate representation of how i feel so i decided to give myself a few days to form a more solid opinion here’s what i arrived at people i don’t think it’s healthy or helpful to put ourselves in a “bubble of safety” by shutting out opposing views i think banning redditors for subscribing or participating in other subreddits of opposing nature is essentially treating that opposition as if it doesn’t exist or is not worthy of any attention and i don’t think that accomplishes anything i think being a participating redditor on opposing subreddits can bring awareness and intelligent discussion to very difficult topics and with that comes the possibility to change people’s minds it can be a source of promoting productive communication to build new perspectives there are some smaller details that make me think that this should not be a practice among subreddits if a redditor is subscribed to a subreddit that doesn’t innately mean that individual agrees with the views or direction of the subreddit a redditor could be seeking to understand how someone of opposition thinks tracking newsevents of an opposing movement or just want to engage in the guilty pleasure of thinking they are right i don’t think any of those reasons should mea they should be banned if a redditor is providing commentary in a subreddit that also does not mean they are supporting they other redditors or posts made within that subreddit a redditor could be trying to challenge other’s views spread factual knowledge or just spark production discussion this type of banning practice feels like the reddit equivalent of trying to control content and viewership within other media outlets i want to thank everyone that provide genuine insight about raids and brigades on reddit and role of moderators this was the most valuable information to me i’m still working on how to award deltas and when i do i will be posting a few,1,401,2553,115,0.043478260869565216
cmv flying any form of confederate battle flag or remembering the csa in any positive light is an incredibly seditious and unpatriotic gesture it is glorifying the single greatest existential threat to the united states of america and its ideals,"i find the concept of flying any confederate battle flag or csa national flag to be not only in poor taste but a seditious action and one of the most unpatriotic displays possible far worse than burning the american flag it is glorifying the bloodiest and most existential threat the usa has ever faced a force that could actually destroy the union  people who fly such a flag are inadvertently or intentionally damaging the dignity of the usa and the men who died to prevent the destruction of the ideals of the union  in effect its one of the most unpatriotic actions possible short of direct treason or conspiracy it is a glorification of sedition

cmv cupcakes are vastly overrated,"while the cupcake craze of the early 2010s has lessened there are still a number of residual holdouts peddling their gourmet cupcakes for 5 here in chicago there are mollys sprinkles magnolia bakery the cupcake counter and countless other selfindulgent cupcake hellholes they are a symbol of the vast marketing done by big cupcake to make us believe that cupcakes are a superior dessert they sit among the cookie the cake and the pie in great american desserts however such a statement is a lie and cupcakes while tasty are overrated due to 1 inefficient taste delivery 2 irregular proportions 3 messiness and 4 overrated convenience these 4 points are not exclusive but cover the basic reasons why cupcakes do not deserve the laud and attention they currently entertain
 position a cupcake is a cake based dessert that consist of cake batter placed in ridged paper cups baked in a specific pan with holes the cake batter bakes until it overflows the hole and is then frosteddecorated on top before being served image for reference furthermore the purpose of a cupcake is to be a more efficient delivery system of cake that can also be individualized
 inefficient taste delivery in appearance a cupcake make sense as a individualized cake however the delivery of frosting and cake is inefficient as the structure of a cupcake makes it impossible to taste the cake and frosting evenly the generally accepted method of biting a cupcake is to pinch the sides of the stump open ones mouth and then bite down through the frosting and up through the cake this supposedly avoids the messiness of grabbing the frosting while still allowing a person to eat the cupcake with hisher hands some may bite the frosting or cake first but those people are fucked in the head however the inherent design of a cupcake makes it impossible to deliver an even taste instead the biter distinctly tastes frosting on the roof of his mouth and cake on his tounge in contrast other handheld foods like a sandwich or burger addresses this issue by encasing the center filling meat cheese condiments etc with bread allowing every bite to be even in how the varying tastes are delivered some have suggested that you can rip the stump off to put it on top of the cupcake but this only proves my point that the natural design of a cupcake is flawed and therefore it is overrated as a dessert
 irregular proportions the inherent design flaw of cupcakes leads to my next point the irregular proportions and delivery cupcakes especially gourmet ones have gotten excessive in their proportions of frosting to cake while cakes normally adhere to a range of frosting depth current cupcakes can range from 5 to 3 of frosting on top this picture alone shows how ridiculous it can get it is not standardized in any way can leave you with either too much sweet frosting or too little depending on the one you get added to the already 35 stump youre also looking at possibly an 8 bite unless you can unhinge your jaw such a is ridiculous as a result you will always receive irregular proportions of frosting and cake as you try to tilt the cupcake for a bite such proportions show that the cupcake is overrated as a dessert 
 messiness the fucked up proportions of current cupcakes causes the next point messiness cupcakes appear to be a cleaner alternative to your average cake its handheld contained in a paper wrapping and solid enough to be turned upside now and not collapse or fall apart however to anyone who has eaten a cupcake they understand that the paper wrapping becomes more of a hindrance than a help once pulled down the wrapping either blocks the bite rubs the bottom of the chin with its dirtiness or gets completely removed for better cupcake eating but once removed the wrapper is now useless waste much like a plate except that unlike a plate the wrapper can no longer catch the crumbs from each bite instead they fall to the floor or your hand additionally the frosted top often too big to consume in one bite will brush the upper lip or nose leaving frosting residue as a result you are left with cake crumbs on your hands and frosting on your face thus messiness
 overrated convenience the messiness of the cupcake supports the final point the overrated convenience of a cupcake a cupcake is intended to be a more convenient cake yet it leaves you with the same messiness and garbage a slice of cake would coupled with the inefficient delivery of fucked up proportions the convenience of eating a cupcake is made minute if not nonexistent additionally if making your own the individualized nature of each cupcake destroys the convenience of the cupcake both baking frosting and cleaning are exponentially increased in time and effort so as to render any future convenience worthless
 it stands the cupcake should be relegated to novelty desserts that while tasty are inherently flawed by their design

 i ask you to change my view on the inferiority of the cupcake and its overrated position in the dessert pantheon
 thanks so much for the comments its making a slow day go by quick im still of the opinion that cupcakes are vastly overrated despite their inherent design flaws and underwhelming eating experience but i need to get some work done so ill be taking a break from responding please continue discussing and fight against big cupcake

cmv hilary clintons repeated reminders of her womanhood are perhaps ironically counter to the feminist philosophy and is the equivalent of playing the race card,"during the debate hilary clinton mentioned the fact that she is a woman and specifically indicated that she is the best candidate solely because she is a woman several times tonight someone who identifies as a feminist  i find this condescending and entirely counter productive that fact that you are a woman no more qualifies you for any job than does being a man the cornerstone of feminism is that a person should be judged not by their sex but by their deeds by so flippantly using her sex as a qualification for the presidency hilary is setting feminism back  in 2008 there was strong and very vocal push back to the obama campaign for playing the race card critics by liberal and conservative demanded that the obama campaign never use his race to appeal to voters which at least as far as obama himself is concerned led to him literally telling the public not to vote for him only because he is black  at any point barack obama had said anything akin to what hilary said tonight he would have been crucified by the press the fact that hilary gets away with this is indicative of an inherent media bias and once again is counterproductive to female empowerment  would love to be able to see the value in this tactic but so far i have found none  change my view sorry for the massive delay in an update i had been running all this from my phone for the last 10 hours and i cant edit the op from there first big shoutouts to upepperonifire uthatguy3444 and umuaddibmcfly
all three of you gave very well written rational critiques to my argument and definitely changed aspects of my view that said while i do now believe sen clinton is justified in her use of this tactic i still feel quite strongly that it is the wrong course of action with respect to achieving a perfect civil society it is quite clear that my definition of feminism iswas far too narrow in this context as has now been pointed out several times im taking an egalitarian stance when the majority of selfproclaimed feminists are part of the socalled second wave movement this means i think that this debate is far more subjective than i originally thought i want to address a criticism that keeps popping up on this thread and that is that hilary never literally said that being a woman is the sole qualification for her candidacy  is inescapably true  though i know for a fact that some of you disagree i think it is and was painfully obvious that sen clinton was strongly implying that her womanhood should be if not the most important factor certainly the deciding factor in the democratic primary every single sentence that comes out of a politicians mouth is laden with subtext in fact more often than not what is implied andor what is left unsaid is of far more consequence than what is said i would even go so far as to say that this subliminal messaging is an integral part of modern public service to say that hilarys campaign should only be judged based upon what she literally says is to willfully ignore the majority of political discourse in this country finally thanks everybody this blew up waaay more than i thought",1,566,3287,167,0.029940119760479042

cmv the same arguments that justify gay marriage also justify polygamy,you typically hear some slipperyslope arguments from the antigay marriage side saying that if we allow gay marriage well also allow pedophilia beastiality and polygamy now the first two i think are ridiculous i think we can all agree that marriage needs to be between consenting adults which dismisses pedophilia and beastiality however i cannot think of any reason why polygamy should not be included in the umbrella of marriage given arguments for gay marriage particularly remember an episode of jon stewart where he responded to this argument by saying people arent born polygamist that just isnt true the definition of being gay is that you are sexually attracted to people of the same sex youd be hard pressed to find someone who hasnt found themselves sexually attracted to multiple people at the same time so why shouldnt a group of three or more consenting adults get the privileges of marriage why is 2 the magic number copying one of my comments for visibility has been a great discussion im gonna try to sum up what my view was and why it changed 1 of my view was that if youre ok with a gay relationship you must be ok with a poly relationship paraphrasing ucjgibson i still believe this holds true 2 was that if youre ok with a relationship you must be ok with that relationship being a legally recognized marriage if youre ok with gay relationships you must be ok with polygamous marriage issue was in part 2 a socially accepted relationship does not necessarily mean it should be a legally recognized marriage as pointed out by utbdabbholm and ugnosticgnome and others the structure of marriage works best with 2 people from a legal and practical standpoint we already have this established structure as the institution of marriage that being said a relationship between a gay couple should be able to advance to marriage status because they should have the same right to access the benefits of marriage as a straight couple however since poly relationships have more than 2 people they are incompatible with the already established institution of marriage so it should not be legal,1,360,2208,71,0.056338028169014086
cmv the mostly us way of writing a date monthdayyear is inferior to writing the date as daymonthyear and should be changed nationwide,"while both systems may seem completely arbitrary i believe the daymonthyear dmy or yearmonthday ymd follows the logical rules of ascendingdescending order and therefore is more intuitive to a person not familiar with either system furthermore time is written in either ascending or descending order secondsminuteshours and it makes little sense to write date in a different way thus i believe that the dmy is superior to the mdy for these reasons it should be changed nationwide usage of the mdy system in in the minority and it only causes confusion across countries unlike imperial units which if stated as imperial units can be converted to metric units and vice versa the date is usually just written as three numbers separeted by a periodslash and therefore you have literally no way telling which way it is written in except for cases that one number is larger than 12 or when the month is written as a word with letters not as a number it would not be the first time a crucial mistake happened somewhere in the world that caused unnecessary hassle because of the way some people write dates  believe that unlike imperial vs metric units this would actually require little costs compared to the benefits and since the inferior system is also the minority the dmy system should be implemented across all the states that use the mdy system

i believe that reactionary responses to terrorist acts eg no bags at 2014 boston marathon are unnecessary mostly ineffective and send a message that terrorism is effective cmv,im a lifelong resident of massachusetts living in the boston area last march the boston marathon was the target of terrorist act that left more than 200 injured and 3 dead this year the announcement was made that there would be no bags allowed into certain areas along the route and runners would not be allowed to keep bags at the finish line nor carry them on their person this notably hamstrung the efforts of service members planning the yearly tough ruck where they carry the packs of fallen soldiers for the entire marathon this news i immediately thought do the organizers not realize that they are doing the exact thing that the horrible individuals that perpetrate these acts want them to do they want us to always be in fear to associate fear with them  wouldnt a better response be for all of us to recognize that we live in a free society but that freedom comes with a price often the highest price of all to proudly continue our tradition in the face of those who would attempt to sow fear and chaos it sends a message that we are strong enriched by the rational conclusion that while we will never be 100 safe we can be 100 free but to sacrifice that for some perceived security is folly change my view want to qualify that i was extremely lucky to not be personally impacted by the events of last year i feel sadness for every family irreparably changed by that day and i cant imagine what they had to go through i would be especially interested in the view of those that have been more deeplypersonally affected by this and other tragedies if that informed your viewpoint ,1,292,1635,179,0.0335195530726257
cmv just as hetero men are held responsible for womens body image issues hetero women should be held responsible for mens selfdestructive and macho behaviour,"first up im not suggesting any kind of legal or otherwise tangible accountability  i mean within the discourse womens romantic preferences should be acknowledged as a contributing factor to the problem of mens macho behaviour it seems to me that in discussions about the female body image crisis mens sexual preferences for skinny and unrealistic female bodies are named as a contributing factor seems to me that the reasoning goes something like women are starving themselves because they think rightly or wrongly that thats what men want it seems to me that men are suffering in another area of life due to their perception of what women want road traffic deathsinjuries world health organisation states that a young age males are more likely to be involved in road traffic crashes than females about threequarters 73 of all road traffic deaths occur among men among young drivers young males under the age of 25 years are almost 3 times as likely to be killed in a car crash as young females dont think its controversial to deduce that driving dangerously is usually an act of bravado which in itself is a manifestation of the macho culture that many young men consider is essential to making themselves appealing to the opposite sex counterarguments well women arent actually impressed by or attracted to aggressive or macho behaviour  yeah well some are  just like some men are attracted to skinny girls  but the problem is that each gender has a warped sense of what the other wants  so if womens misguided belief that they need to look a certain way is pinned on men then mens misguided belief that they need to behave a certain way should be pinned on men women women arent starving themselves for men theyre chasing body image ideals to impress other women  ive never bought this argument which ive also seen deployed in discussions about why women wear makeup expensive clothes etc  sure maybe consciously a lot of women want to look good to impress other women  but i would argue that their entire conception of what looks good and what is feminine is intrinsically informed by what men find attractive  similarly with why men drive fast and generally act like macho idiots  a group of lads might be hooning around the streets of your local town on a saturday night without a woman in the car to impress but the driver is displaying braggadocio to the other men in order to establish himself as the dominant member of the group  his method of attempting to display dominance aggressive driving macho behaviour is informed by what he thinks is appealing to women what do i want i said in the first paragraph im not saying we should scorn women for this in any tangible way  im simply saying that it should be acknowledged as a part of the problem of young male aggression in the way that male sexual preferences are frequently identified as a part of the body image problem among women  in recent years i think many men would have experienced a backlash from femalebodyidealnonconforming women when commenting on the attractiveness of a 
femalebodyidealconforming woman   who express attraction to or admiration for men engaging in dangerous macho behaviour should face the same public disapproval in the same way that men who like skinny women do as men are being educated through the public discourse on embracing real women ie with curves and femalebodyidealnonconforming body types women should be educated through public discourse on embracing men who display malebehaviouralidealnonconforming behaviours as indicated by strikethrough and a few other words for clarity

cmv allowing people to contract sexual labor could eliminate some of the ambiguity that has led to the  movement while allowing women to benefit economically from the demand for sex with females,"this is an attempt to regulate the informal exchange of sexual  labor and economic goods that lies at the heart of the  movement this idea does not concern rape sexual assault or any  nonconsensual form of violence it will primarily deal with charges of  sexual harassment perpetrated by men against women starts here goal of the me too movement to totally separate sexual attraction  from  employment is a total fantasy  as it stands now there is a shadow  economy in which men systematically extort women’s sexual labor changing  the laws around contracting sexual labor could eliminate some of the  ambiguity that has led to the me too movement while allowing  women to  benefit economically from the demand for sex with females are the points of my argument romantic relationships happen all the time in the workplace these relationships affect employment decisions this will not change and any attempts to regulate these romantic relationships will push them further into the shadows further disempowering women

if they suffer from chronic pains and illnesses why should breeds of dogs be continuously bred which also makes the problem worse because future generations get progressively more screwed up because i want a pug is not a valid reason to continue their suffering just as how it is cruel to keep certain animals in captivity since the conditions mean they struggle or how puppy mills are cruel and completely disregard animal welfare ",1,116,696,93,0.043010752688172046
cmv users should be able to change their name at least once even if it comes at a fee similar to that of reddit gold,edit spez comments on the subject   think i am speaking for the vast majority of people who created their oldest and sometimes only account with a name that is either really stupid irrelevant or reveals personal information when i say we should be able to change our name at least one time even if it comes at a small fee i think that would be a beneficial alternative to reddit gold  this isn’t to suggest that you have to pay for it i would prefer having it be completely free just limited in how frequent one could change it  combat the issue of maintaining a history that can be traced to you i would suggest having any and every post or comment update accordingly when you decide to change your name  this for example the name of my main account that is over 6 years old is my full irl name i was a young lurker who didn’t fully understand much of what reddit was about when i created it and it’s a pain in the ass having to replicate an identical feed with access to certain subs where applications had to be reviewed in order to post to the given sub for example being ‘whitelisted’ on rstreetwear requires a google form including 15 unique pictures to be reviewed so one can post a wdywtwhat did you wear today post there are a plethora of other instances similar to this on a variety of different subs such that simply being able to keep the main account but changing the name would completely circumvent this issue seeing that i have little to no experience with  programming or any substancial technical knoweldge in regards to software development i feel its safe to say i would be unaware of any potential implications changing your u  would bring as far as preserving long term identity or general experience none the less i still hold this view why should i change it,1,334,1978,119,0.05042016806722689

cmv i should not pay extra towards my student loans because the next us president might forgive student loan debt,"edit 1 everyone seems to think im suggesting i just ignore the loan i should have been clearer i certainly will be paying at least the minimum payment that would pay back the loan over 10 years im considering whether i should pay the loan over 10 years or 1 year post
i have about about 20000 in loans at a fixed interest rate of 45 i have the income to completely pay them within a year however if the next newly elected us president implements broad student loan forgiveness wouldnt that be a waste of my money warren proposes mass student loan forgiveness conditional on income warren proposes forgiving up to 50000 in federal student loans for all borrowers with a household income of 100000 or less and partial forgiveness to those up to 250000 sanders proposes the cancelation of all outstanding us student loans regardless of borrowers’ income levels put my personal situation for context but the real cmv is for the indebted student in general shouldnt we only pay the minimum payment as long as there is the possibility that the debt will be canceled 2 its fomo i want to avoid the situation in which i pay all my loans off and then broad student loan forgiveness is subsequently passed i mentioned this in a comment student loan interest payment is tax deductible so my real interest rate is about 3 thats about the same as inflation here in california in real dollars it costs me almost nothing to pay only the minimums 3 ive been convinced that the likelihood that broad student loan forgiveness is passed is near infinitesimal as my mind has been changed i wont factor in loan forgiveness into my personal finance plan as many pointed out since my interest rate is so low it can make financial to pay the minimums and invest the difference in low fee etfs for example i might as well i have a high risk tolerance i already max my 401k match roth and have leftovers for the occasional rwallstreetbets yolo i just want to highlight ucarlko20s comment about the economics of sanders plan incredible depth plans may not directlyobviously affect how you would invest but they would kill the value of many stocks including your etfswho they would affect divert our financial activity to other countries and could even end up net costing us tax revenue to the countless people saying things like not pay what you owe because you agreed to pay it you freeloading parasite you misspelled rob the taxpayer to pay off a debt which you willingly knowingly incurred boomer but in all seriousness i understand your feelings im neither advocating for or against government debt forgiveness in fact because im just starting my high paying career student loan forgiveness would be a net loss i already pay 40k in taxes id pay way more in taxes income and capital gains in the long run paying for other peoples loans but if its going to go through id rather have my loans forgiven so im not completely on the losing end of the deal neither sanders or warrens plan is how id ameliorate the student debt crisis personally i would implement subsidized income share agreements people would continue to pay their current loans if they choose to but if a person feels it is in their best interest their tuition or loan will be fully payed in exchange they agree to pay back a percentage of their income for a fixed number of years for example 10 of their income for 10 years the agreement parameters can be influenced by income net worth occupation degree major etc would allow people to get out of crushing debt to reenter the economy consumption and invest in themselves in theory some people will end up paying more than they needed to and some people will be a net loss but either way they are back in the economy which is good for all of us most importantly it feels more fair isas would prevent people like me from taking advantage of the program its not rational for me to sign an agreement to garnish my wages seems that one reason this post has gained traction is that people recognize the incongruity of a program that incentivizes a person like me to postpone their additional debt payments in order to have them forgiven",1,736,4671,115,0.06086956521739131

 a woman states shes uncomfortable around men after a rape everybody myself included is completely accepting of that statement and provide sympathy for her obvious trauma certain haircuts cologne etc may make this worse however i have seen people who have been robbedraped by black people who also state that theyre uncomfortable around those people as it trudges up painful memories every time thats stated the comments or people nearby state how thats incorrect thats racist you cant say that etc they often state how you cant judge the race based upon the few and while i agree that also pertains to the example with women feeling scared by men i dont see how these two situations are really that different  truly curious about my mind being changed would love some feedback thanks i should clarify by uncomfortable i mean essentially triggers ptsd in a way not just uneasiness im not saying that black people are more prone to crime at all simply that seeing somebody that reminds you of the attacker could trigger a ptsd attack",1,201,1210,218,0.027522935779816515
cmv beginning in high school american students should choose one of two paths the university path or the trade path,"i am a high school math teacher at an urban public high school in my years of teaching i have noticed that there is a clear distinction between students who plan to go to a college or university after high school and those who do not i believe that much of the high school curriculum is almost completely useless for students who do not plan to attend college i am a college graduate and even currently working on my masters degree so i understand that the knowledge and skills acquired in high school courses will be beneficial to those students going to college however students who plan on entering the workforce or attending a trade school straight out of high school have little to no use for much of what we teach system would allow students who want to go to college to choose the path that includes curriculum very similar to what it already is students choosing the trade path would take courses that teach basic mechanical skills technical skills etc that are needed for a wide variety of trade professions  current education system was built around preparing students for college but the reality is that many do not attend college and they do not need to there are countless professions that are crucial to the way our society works that do not require a college degree ie construction workers electricians plumbers truck driversthe list goes on and on and those professions should not be viewed as lesser than their degreerequiring counterparts students should not be admonished for not wanting to attend college predict that the main argument against this notion is that 15yearolds often do not know what they want to do with their lives and asking them to make such an important decision would not be wise i agree that they might not know exactly what they want to do but the vast majority know if they want to attend college or not by that age and of course students could change paths within reason if they so chose it wouldnt be something that sets their futures in stone but something that would allow them to benefit from their education much more than many do currently with so many comments i cannot reply to them all so i want to clarify a few things here that seem to be common elements among what people are saying i do not believe that we should force children to make a permanent decision about the rest of their lives at age 14 a very important part of my argument is that children should be allowed to switch paths within reason of course without delaying their degree somewhat related to  above there would be some common courses between the paths however many paths there would be students should still be required to take basic math science languages etc as these teach important skills that people need regardless of their career path apparently i have said something to make some people believe that i should not be a teacher because i dont know what education really means for me one of the most important parts of education is that students learn to think critically and make logical decisions i tell my students nearly every day that the problemsolving skills they learn in my math class will carry them much further than the formulas they learn but i would argue that these problemsolving skills can also be learned in classes that simultaneously give them the knowledge and skills needed to pursue a particular path in life

cmv i believe that children should be given mandatory vaccinations if their body is labeled as healthy enough to do so,to go into more detail i am of the belief that vaccinations should not be the parents choice for their children but rather should be mandatory the only reason a child should not be immunized is if such immunization would be harmful to the childs body due to preexisting medical conditions the safety of the children and the safety of their peers and the public should be put ahead of the selfrighteous antivaxxers i am also under the impression and admittedly probably will remain so that the science on vaccinations and their positive effects outweigh any negative effects  am open to discussion but please do be disciplined enough to cite some form of scientific journals or studies if you bother mentioning medical effects and sideeffects of vaccinations such as seizures autism etc,1,133,808,120,0.041666666666666664
cmv fear of girls getting abused is a poor excuse for opposing gender inclusive public restrooms,one of the counter arguments to non gender specific restrooms or allowing trans people to use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify is that a male pedophile can follow a little girl into the restroom under the guise of identifying as female and then molest her my arguments against that logic as as follows  signs dont stop determined criminals  most mass shootings happen in places with a gun free zone sign on the door that did nothing to stop the murderer a ladies restroom sign would be just as ineffective at stopping a molester  nothing is stopping you from checking on your daughter in this example a dad is at a store with his young daughter who needs to use the restroom he walks her to the restroom and a man follows her in he cant say anything about it because if that person could just say they identify as a woman and thats why they were using that restroom when in reality they were a molester my response to this is in that particular example follow that person into the restroom and make sure your daughter is ok in a world where anyone can go to any restroom so can you   boys get molested too nothing is stopping a male pedophile from following a boy into the restroom today but that doesnt seem to get as much concern as the male pedophile in the girls room  reinforcing gendered restrooms would do nothing to help boys safety  parents concerned about the safety of their child in a public restroom eliminating gender segregation of restrooms would be the best outcome therefore a mother could take her young son to the bathroom as could a father and daughter so they could be supervised in case someone wanted to do them harm  to argue otherwise is either deliberate or unconscious transphobia   ive seen some good replies so far and awarded a delta im willing to award more depending on the replies i would say i have yet to see a real good counterargument to my 3rd point ive you ever seen the documentary red pill theres a decent point that some mens rights advocates make about the disposabilty of men basically its the societal and cultural reason that only men are eligible for the draft in the us the whole women and children first thing in a disaster and the fact that nearly all workplace fatalities are men if we really care about people getting sexually assaulted in bathrooms lets take steps to safeguard all people not just women and girls just recently in my home town a man was arrested for filming people in a walmart mens bathroom while some comments in the news story were those of shock and sympathy for the victims there were a lot more jokes and minimizing than there would have been had this been a man spying in women ,1,497,2750,97,0.041237113402061855

cmv abuse doesnt excuse abusing others,"in english class today im 18 if that gives some perspective we watched a documentary about  which is a fairly horrific case of child abuse in it after the trial for the mother concludes she is found innocent on the basis of also being abused by the father of the girl ill spare most of the details because its just the example that started the debate id voiced that i didnt think that was fair because the abuse lasted over 10 years but i was met with alot of backlash from my classmatesmy school is heavily leftwing if that adds and context but none of them would go further with why they felt so strongly she was innocent i talked with a few friends about it after and got a few reasons but none of them seemed very persuasive
 firstly they talked about given it happened in the 60s and the  criminality of domestic abuse aswel as the helpfulness of police in domestic abuse cases in that time was poor so made it impossible for her to go to the police but given the case involved serious child abuse i dont think its a reasonable outlook that she would honestly believe the police wouldnt act second point and third pointill put them together because neither felt very good was that 
a women couldnt be self sustaining during the 60s so any form of divorce was equal to suicide 
b she became complacent to the abuse
but for example if you were poor and your boss killed someone reporting them would result in poverty but it doesnt give you legal or moral grounds to be complicit  and if becoming complacent of apathetic to others due to unfortunate circumstance were a valid reason for abusing others then most abuses would be considered innocent but not least
she must of been paranoid of deranged from the abuse despite the case not giving her any leeway in terms of mentally illness claims and her neighbors all said she seemed completely mentally stable she hid it due to tough stance on the mentally impairedill then how could she be exempt on the basis of an illness she never showed not trying to redo the whole debate its just everyone i know seemed extremely adamant that no matter the circumstance if you are being abused it isnt your fault if you abuse others i understand most of the people im around are very liberal but i wasnt really able to get a genuine reason why someone of automatically innocent other then they just are im writing this because im curious why being abused would be seem different to other trauma or abuse given that no one i know argued in favour of  sexual abuse cycles when it came out a few months prior
please dont focus too much on the semantics of the case as im mainly interested in the philosophypolitics of the attitude itself what makes being abusedbut not under a constant duress a valid morallegal motivation for doing bad things 1 when i said very left wing i meant they lean more into collective responsibility rather than personal also i wont change title but justification is probably a more accurate wording that excuse of what i was trying to argue",1,547,3359,41,0.0975609756097561

 time in college my housemate came home from a work shift and gleefully mentioned that he had driven home drunk everyone within earshot replied with unambiguous condemnation your friend admits that they constantly text while driving it is an underreaction to not express strong disapproval for comparison think of what reaction is appropriate if you find out that someone is stealing bikes or scamming old people on craigslist or abusing their pets or knowingly transmitting stdshopefully one wouldnt just laugh and forget about it you text and drive you might kill or paralyze a kid that you otherwise wouldnt have this should be treated as high risk and morally reprehensible behavior we dont have to just sheepishly accept that everyone does it like leaving out dirty dishes or eating too much sugar that might change my view include alternate calculations of risk vs reward alternate interpretations responsibility evidence that peerpressure does not work well for norm enforcement evidence of unintended consequences reasons why i should shift emphasis from dont harm innocents to dont put yourself at legal risk or reasons why i should save my breath for something more important yesterday it occurred to me that i dont know how frequently i interact with people who have caused auto fatalities its not something that ever comes up in conversation i guess those people just walk around with an emotional albatross for the rest of their life and this is part of their punishment seems like the punishment does not lead to much deterrence though hence the need to be more proactive about disincentivizing bad behavior",1,283,1914,72,0.041666666666666664

cmv women have it easier when it comes to datingrelationships than men,i feel like with online dating and all that jazz it makes dating far easier for women if you compared a man and a woman of roughly the same attractiveness level the woman would most likely receive far more matches in real life it seems like women have it easier although the dynamic seems to be changing slightly in terms of who is supposed to ask who out it seems as if a man typically has to go to far more effort to pursue a relationship whilst a woman will usually be on the receiving end in essence it feels like guys are usually the ones to get rejected whilst women get to do the rejecting i wont deny that while women may get more opportunities some of the opportunities might be of lower quality such as a guy only out for sex ons with fake intentions etc but i still feel like the average shy girlintroverted girl has a much better shot than a guy in the same position my view holy cow thanks guys i went to bed and this post blew up over night ill try to read most of the other comments later,1,197,1100,73,0.0547945205479452

cmv nba commentators and analysts spend too much time speculating about the personal lives of the players,i get that it’s the playoffs and that the off season is approaching but there is quite a bit of coverage in the nba that spends a significant chunk of time speculating about the psyche or psychological state of the players with little legitimacy i noticed this most with the reactions to kyrie irving after the celtics recent loss to the bucks kyrie had probably the worse 3 games of his career at the worst possible time and the buck played exceptionally but the main topic of conversation on espn is about kyrie’s presumably flawed character the lakers negotiations with ty lue fall flat and the speculation is about how this is an indication of lebron james supposedly self evident desire to force his coach into the organization the sixers loose and we talk about embiids maturity levels  cant exactly remember or imagine what commentary was like in the 80s and 90s but i want to say that commentator spent less time making claims about players psychological states than they do now i understand that players have more of a voice and are more visible than previous eras and that this has contributed to more of an interest in their personal lives but i feel like espn in particular is more similar to something like tmz than traditional sports analysis  get that ratings are a factor and sensationalism has the potential to increase these numbers but considering the advanced metrics available there could easily be more interesting and indepth commentary and analysis of the game and the players performances  not sure if this is a current trend with all sports but it feels like commentary is becoming too psychoanalytical and getting farther away from the game itself,1,290,1697,106,0.05660377358490566

cmv liberal americans are justified to be angry with trump supporters and to worry about the future,since the election theres been various statistics showing that liberals are more pessimistic about the countrys future and dislike trump and many of his supporters since the shooting last month iirc its become popular and easy to say that liberals should be nicer and more open minded but i believe they would be naive not to worry about republicans and very passive not to be angry with republican voters republicans have disproportionately high political power due to them living in smaller states and rural areas their votes matter more than those in cities and states like california or new york in the senate and presidential elections this means they can impose their ideas on the majority of people even if they are unpopular among the majority eg trump this is undemocratic and worrying given their behaviour republicans policies and politicians are genuinely dangerous republican policies on health care and government support will almost certainly hurt people and even cost lives most political parties wouldnt consider policies as extreme as theirs but they are special in how far right wing they are their indifference to climate change poverty poor healthcare and inequality means that their policies will actually make america and the world worse itd be stupid for liberals to be ok with this plus despite obamacare disproportionately helping trump supporters they still want it dismantled just because they see it as a win how can you not fear someone who hates you so much theyre willing to suffer just to beat you trump and many other republican politicians show erratic andor ammoral behaviour that should be concerning to people even mainstream republicans like mcconnel regularly behave appallingly republicans cannot be reasoned with as can be seen by their contempt for higher education the cbo media science and economics republicans dont see truth as objective they believe it is simply a matter of opinion and anyone or anything which says theyre wrong must be biased because theres no way they can actually be wrong because of this republicans will enact policies that are dangerous without any concern for the consequences for the future or even themselves this erratic behaviour makes them frustrating at best and dangers to themselves and others at worst simply put republicans could do pretty much anything despite how crazy and stupid it seems in many ways trump personifies the gop better than john mccain or mitt romney ever could because of his combination of ignorance and arrogance they lack respect and compassion for others as can be seen from policies like gerrymandering and voter suppression tactics like the obstruction from the gop on things like the supreme court and just their general behaviour like the nomination of trump who is basically a prejudiced bully republicans seem more motivated by a need to beat liberals and to control america than any desire for self improvement or any moral concerns their indifference to problems like racism sexism and homophobia should anger liberals also their lack of concern for police shootings or sexual assault and their contempt for abortion makes them a genuine danger to women and minorities their priority seems to be to preserve a social order in which they have their values imposed on those they view to be inferior eg women minorities the poor lgbt even if its at their own expense am i wrong about how bad republicans are or should liberals not fear them because republicans will quickly lose power this is a footnote from the cmv moderators wed like to remind you of a couple of things firstly please read through our rules if you see a comment that has broken one it is more effective to report it than downvote it speaking of which downvotes dont change views any questions or concerns feel free to message us happy cmving,1,636,4190,100,0.06
cmv white privilege is a counterproductive way to talk about power imbalances,some context before i explain my view im a sociology and anthropology professor at a small liberal arts college in the american south the school is both more conservative and more heavily african american than most colleges and my view has been informed by teaching in that environment im from new york and was educated at elite schools in the northeast and the last few years have been my first experience having to lead discussions in such diverse classrooms im also a white guy so my perspective and role in the classroom are influenced by that an educator im trying to convey complex social science topics to students in ways that give them the best chance of getting something out of the conversation my experience has been that classroom discussions specifically about white privilege get derailed because white male students get immediately defensive in a lot of cases their reactions are tied to their own personal struggles they grew up poor in a singlemother household joined the military for lack of better options suffered a traumatic brain injury in iraq etc and they perceive the very phrase white privilege as trivializing their life experience  view the term white privilege is alienating the people who are most in need of convincing and were better off framing the conversation in other terms using terminology that engenders that kind of response further silos us as a society and is counterproductive im not really sure i have a better alternative but fwiw ive had success introducing the concept of privilege by way of intersectionality which simultaneously legitimizes struggles due to class disability or whatever else,1,272,1701,80,0.05
cmv cultural appropriation is benign at worst and extremely beneficial at best,i am genuinely dumbfounded by the number of people who believe that cultural appropriation is harmful taking issue with cultural appropriation seems to be the equivalent of a child throwing a fit because someone else is copying him  can understand how certain aspects of appropriation can be harmful if done improperly ex taking credit for originating a practice that was originated by another culture appropriating in order to mock poorly mimicking the appropriated practice thereby attaching an unearned stigma to it etc i do not however understand how one can find the act of appropriation problematic in and of itself in most cases it seems like cultural appropriation is the opposite of bad some would say good our alphabet our numerals mathematics spices gunpowder steam power paper and countless other things have been appropriated i am 100 sure that a more extensive list that makes the point more effectively can be made by someone with more than a cursory understanding of history and thank god they were cultural appropriation seems to be a driving force in innovation and general global improvement  idea that one culture needs permission from another in order to adopt a practice seems palpably absurd it violates the basic liberties of the appropriators and does not violate any rights of the appropriated the concept makes little sense when applied to entire cultures it breaks down entirely when applied at the individual level if my neighbor cooks his meat in such a way that makes the meat more appealing to me i should have nothing stopping me from mimicking him is my neighbor obligated to reveal any secrets to me absolutely not but does he have any genuine grievance with me surely not  simply do not see how appropriation is bad note i am referring exclusively to the act of appropriation i am not necessarily referring to negative practices that tend to accompany appropriation  i am blown away by the positivity in this thread im glad that we can take a controversial topic and talk about it with civility i didnt expect to get this many replies i wish i could respond to them all but im a little swamped with homework,1,368,2222,80,0.05
cmv being a skeptic is not the same as being a denier,"i have a science background as well as economics i have a solid understanding of how dangerous it can be to use models as facts how difficult it can be to collect valid and reliable data and to make reliable inferences tired however of when i ask any kind of question online or in person about climate change that im looked at with disgust think being a skeptic makes the science better it makes the interventions stronger and it refines the communication following i think are incredibly important questions to ask and any climate activist should be doing everything they can to strengthen their arguments climate change is real  my question would be to define climate change what it is what caused it what are the models saying and at what level of confidence

cmv as a nonamerican i see trump as a total regression for the us and bernie sanders the total opposite,i cant deal with it im trying to use logic but it seems im incapable to see why someone whos in his right mind would vote for donald trump dont know if theres something about a major lack of education or a really strong wish for going backwards in history in the us  an outsider perspective this guy represents at least ideologically everything that is wrong in human and modern civilization im reading about this bernie sanders and his propositions and i cant understand why anyone with a bit of commonsense and who wants the us to achieve some kind of development as a nation wont vote for him  see that guy as the only option whoa a lot of interesting and insightful answers i think i have a better picture of these two guys now i see trumps figure is being manipulated strongly by the media with much of his comments being taken out of context hes saying a lot of things that many americans want to hear apparently theres a difference between his show figure and his actual positions which are considered pretty traditionally american by many of you and a lot of comments refer to trumps business achievements as something positive skills that would be reflected in the country if hes elected sense theres a feeling of overall dissatisfaction with obama may be helped by the social media i cant help but think that trumps biggest strenght is pretty much being a big antiobama reaction in many ways politically socially and economically many of you said that you like bernies positions and that much of them should be good for the people but the problem is theyre pretty much utopic or unrealistic others stated that his vision of the economy would harm america and that the fact that he doesnt have real achievements in politics or comparing to trump in any business at all is something pretty negative bottomline as i see it and that it was pointed out by some of you is that both of them are running heavily ideological campaigns which makes them very similar characters each in their own way,1,359,2115,107,0.09345794392523364

cmv religion does not deserve to have any special protections,a religion in its most simple form is the belief in a god gods deity or supreme beings some religions command you to live by certain tenants while others motivate you to follow a specific path of spiritually overall they all can be argued to give the follower a sense of purpose and belonging or meaning in life  just because you deeply believe in something does not make it factual what is supported and given mobility in society should be reasonable and defendable to an objective level  what reason does any religion have a right to be given special protections against questioning societal obligations or laws and institutions themselves a religion should be thought of as any other type of thought or opinion and should be handled critically if no proper reasoning can be used to justify a belief then said belief is simply unjustifiable  as how there is no real reasoning used to justify any religion i fail to see why there are any special protections for any of them because i fell asleep and didnt respond ,1,182,1070,63,0.06349206349206349
cmv religious people should not pick and choose which parts of their religious text they choose to followbelieve if they believe it is the word of god,"to preface this i was raised lutheran christian my entire life but i currently identify as agnostic my entire family is extremely religious this view of mine is moreso oriented at christians although it could of course expand to other religions 

 phrase this in the context of christianity i find it extremely hypocritical for christians who for example are against gay marriage or think homosexuality is a sin but who have tattoos or have had premarital sex or are divorced or committed adultery the list goes on 

 are so many things the bible says you shouldnt do i dont feel like christians can pick and choose which parts of the bible they would like to follow and which ones are okay to not follow sometimes people will say that theres a difference between the old and new testaments in belief systems however leviticus 1919 states that one should not wear clothing woven of different types of material  but christians have no problem wearing cotton polyester blends or other fabric mixtures yet leviticus 18 and 20 communicates that homosexuality is a sin and the majority of christians while possibly accepting to a gay person still feel as if gay marriage is unholy same book 

 do understand that there are christians who support gay marriage which also confuses me since i feel like in order to have faith and truly believe in your god that you would also have to believe the full word of god aka the bible not just certain parts 

 how can someone believe in certain scientific findings when the bible clearly contradicts them for example the earth is billions of years old but the bible says differently is the word of god wrong if you believe in those scientific facts then how can you believe in the bible if its wrong 

 guess what im ultimately saying is that if one truly believes in their god then they must also fully believe in and abide by the religious text words of god as well not just certain parts ",1,346,2011,154,0.03896103896103896
cmv fliptop toothpaste caps are universally better than screwtop caps,"after buying a new brand of toothpaste crest because it was on sale instead of my usual brand colgate i was horrified to find that it came with a screwtop cap after using it for a week its obvious that fliptop caps are universally better than screwtop caps and there should be no reason for screwtop capped toothpaste to remain on the market of fliptop its faster to open
 it can be opened one handed leaving the other hand to hold the toothbrush
 you dont have to find a place to put the screwtop while brushing your teeth
 you dont risk the top falling down the drain and being lost forever
 for households with young children the screwtop is a potential choking hazard

cmv caffeine content of beverages should have to clearly displayed on the front of the bottle like alcohol content on beer wine and spirits,caffeine is a drug that is often overlooked and its negative effects genreally glossed over in our society clearly its not as bad as alcohol and not needed to calculate a safe dose in the case of caffeine but cleaclearly labeling the caffeine content will allow people to see how much caffeine they ingest at a glance many people are not aware of how much caffeine is in soda and often get addicted to caffeine without realizing it is happeneing i think that one of the reasons beverage companies use caffeine in many drinks is to get people hooked on that beverage many people are also sensitive to caffeine and could use the labels to judge wether or not they want to drink that drink late in the day or when they need to sleep caffeine also is bad for people with certain heart conditions and will increase the likely hood a person will avoid that drink if they choose to consume less caffeine overall i think adding the content will help because it subliminaly shows people that caffeine is a drug and should be treated like it while increasing consumer awareness and choice while also not discouraging or inconvenienceing anyone who chooses to use caffeine hello users of cmv this is a footnote from your moderators wed just like to remind you of a couple of things firstly please remember to read through our rules if you see a comment that has broken one it is more effective to report it than downvote it speaking of which downvotes dont change views if you are thinking about submitting a cmv yourself please have a look through our popular topics wiki first any questions or concerns feel free to message us happy cmving,1,292,1955,143,0.02097902097902098

2 interfaceuser experience using a 5 phone to do anything is always less convenient than using a computer with a large screen or multiple screens and large physical keyboard especially with people who have visual or motor impairments
3 security it is much easier to steal a smartphone and access someones accounts than it is to steal a computer many users of certain services like venmo would never use an app if they had access to the services through a web interface

5 negligible costs for large vc funded companies having their core functionality be accessible from both a web portal and an app are negligible compared to the benefits literally can see no good reason why a company would force you to use an app for a service that can also be performed using a computer through a web interface edit to clarify im not saying there is anything wrong with companies offering apps but it should just be another option not a requirement unless the service is unique to mobile applications and simply wouldnt work on a computer eg pokemon go",1,421,2441,71,0.056338028169014086
cmv parents shouldnt pierce their babies ears before the child can verbally ask for it,"im actually having this debate with my wife at the moment  for context our baby girl just turned 6 months old  many out there including our pediatrician believe that it is best to pierce the babies ears before she is old enough to understand the pain  also for full disclosure i actually love the idea of my daughter having earrings just not before she wants them i simply cannot understand doing this to a baby and thats why i am here  change my view  literally everybody granted a small sample size of around a dozen people i have spoken to says i should have my babies ears pierced but i just cant get behind it lets forget about my baby and just talk about babies in general  to start baby girls if a baby girl doesnt want her ears pierced when she is older  why should the choice be made for her  they are tiny holes but they are still mostly permanent a shot injection is pain but it provides a benefit  who is to say that earring holes are a benefit  certainly not the baby right why would parents subject their baby to pain at all without a clear benefit  the logic is lost on me entirely boys know one couple that had their baby boy ears pierced  im not trying to start a gender debate here  but statistically speaking most boys in the english speaking world do not wear earrings  so i have the same argument here as i do with girls but even stronger statistics to back it up  granted im fine with boys getting earrings but againit is when they want oneseveral  i believe that piercing a babies ears takes away what could be an exciting decision they make for themselves about themselves early in life  it also subjects them to a small amount of discomfort for what i believe is no benefit am hopeful that the responses here will either change my view entirely or make me hate the idea less  it is causing some pretty serious friction in my family and inlaws  i could almost see an argument about religious beliefs or cultural practices  but that is not what i am here to discuss  i had no idea how many viewscomments i was going to get here  i will attempt to give deltas wherewhen i can as many of you bring up some good points  i havent fully changed my view but this is clearly more complicated than i originally thought  that said thank you to everybody that has commented and contributed to the conversation

cmv in the price is right the third contestant in one bid should never bid 1,i see it all the time four people playing one bid on the price is right trying to get the closest to the value of the item without going over  the first and second contestants bid too high and the third says one dollar confident that theirs isnt over  but then comes the fourth contestant who frequently will counter with 2  to bid a dollar the third contestant would have to believe that the goods are actually worth 1 never happens and i think it might be impossible or that the fourth player will believe that the goods are worth more than a prior bid even though the third contestant doesnt think they in fact are  but how could one know that about the fourth players beliefs  and furthermore the 1 actually reduces their chances of believing that as it draws their attention to the fact that you think it isnt  so as  you should never bid 1 but should bid some credible amount that has a nonzero chance of being too high  this way  has to choose between 1 and outbidding you or someone higher than you  yet i see this third person 1  under saw it today  are these people just idiots or am i missing something  cmv and convince me i missed something,1,229,1195,80,0.0875
cmv if states vote to ban abortion they should be required to establish statefunded support systems for women and children in need  and those systems should be up for vote too,for the record i am vehemently prochoice and that part of my view will not be changed  said if this is the direction our country is voting to go i believe we should require more governmentfunded support organizations and easements for the people directly impacted by this decision women and children in need admittedly not considered all the pros cons and logistics of setting something like this in motion but i believe it’s beyond irresponsible to pass laws and restrictions that will have significant short and longterm impact on our country’s population culture economy and healthcare systems without requiring a support system for the inevitable equal or opposite reactions i don’t think it’s possible to take something away without giving something back to fill the void if we’re going to make matters of personal choice such as abortion nonnegotiable statelevel decisions then those states not just independently funded organizations need to accept responsibility for the impact on their individual citizens and the resulting health of their larger communities  this is a basic concept for solving a complex issue but it’s my view nonetheless cmv,1,186,1222,181,0.022099447513812154
cmv proportional representation multi party system is better than winner takes all two party system,"in a two party winnertakesall system you cant vote for a third party you agree more with because that is subtracting a vote from the major party that you agree with the most and thats basically equivalent to voting for the party you agree the least with so in essence voting for the party you agree with the most is practically voting for the party you agree with the least this is why its a two party system  you have a country with two tribes that benefit from attacking anything the other tribe stands for an us and them mentality on a more fundamental level then it has to be you also artificially group stances of unrelated issues together like social issues and economic issues  and even issues inside of those why can i statistically predict your stance on universal health care if i know your stance on gun control that doesnt make much sense  the most crucial point is how the winner takes all system discourages cooperation on a fundamental level cooperation is is the most effective way to progress in politics its like rowing with the wind versus rowing against it  we look at proportional representation systems this cooperation is a must each party has to cooperate negotiate and compromise with other parties if they even want to be in power at all this is because multiple parties has to collaborate to form a government equivalent of the white house with a majority of votes between them since they are different parties in government getting everyone on board every policy is not a given so playing nice with the opposition is smart in case you need the extra votes in the legislature branch house of representatives senate  there is much less tribalism at play and voters are more likely to switch parties to something that suits them better if they are dissatisfied the parties has to stay intellectually honest about the issues the voters wont forgive corruption and lobbying the way they are likely to do in a two party system  would argue that proportional representation is more democratic this is because you can vote on a small party say the environmental party for example and the votes actually matter because the large parties would want to flirt with the small parties to get their representation in legislature and government giving the small party leverage to negotiate environmental policy with the large party one argument i have heard in favor of the two party model is that it ensures competence in governing because both parties would have had experience governing but in practice small parties will have proportionally small roles in a collaboration government as they grow accumulating experience while bringing new ideas and approaches with them as they eventually reach a point where they have dangerous responsibility  my reference is the scandinavian model vs the us model

cmv you cannot reject parts of the bible and believe others if you decide what to believe or not believe it defeats the whole point of a religious dogma,two major arguments i have  in general rules cannot be selectively followed or it defeats their purpose the whole reason rules exist is because humans cannot be trusted to decide for themselves how to behave but selectively following rules means that humans get to do just that and rules have no power so if people choose to ignore the rule in the bible about not mixing fabrics then they can justify ignoring rules like dont murder because of the precedent the bible is accepted based on faith that the word of god is infallible if you believe parts of the word of god are false than you are rejecting the premise that its infallible and thus theres no reason to believe in any of it if you contend that parts of the bible are metaphorical or were modified from their original text then you open up the passages that you do believe in to the same criticism not trying to be an ratheistesque religious basher or anything im just genuinely curious how this is reconciled and im very open to the possibility that im misunderstanding what faith means since ive never really had it in my life you,1,199,1193,156,0.03205128205128205

cmv water resources should be under state control,this post is inspired mainly by my perhaps limited knowledge of florida water rights but could apply elsewhere as well nestle has come under fire again here and in michigan for its water extraction according to the article linked below florida landowners have rights to the water which can be pumped or sold for small permitting fees now as someone who themselves has a well for my household water i understand the need for land owners to have water access but i believe this needs to be regulated closer water cant be compared to other mineral rights as its extraction from one area will affect levels and supply everywhere especially florida where almost all the freshwater is interconnected by the underground aquifer this water is not taxed or regulated closely by the state local governments and districts have a lot of control in who can buy land and tap into rivers and springs this makes it easy for aspiring corporations to get access to resources with little oversight especially in the low population areas where these operations are typically located large corporations have no trouble buying out landowners and councils who otherwise may not be able to afford to not take the deal its even more egregious because it is going towards bottled water which of course has an even larger environmental impact down the line unlike other industries that may pump out water for use in a value added sense we as a public are not seeing any revenue from this product think this should come under state regulation and water usage should at the very least be taxed on a usage basis rather than a small onetime fee additionally this use should be subject to terms that change on a regular basis based on impact studies rainfall numbers etc this would give more public oversight as well officials in charge would be subject to voters all around the state rather than just the local voters this is important because as i said the water resources impact the state as a whole not just the small regions where the water is located its frustrating as it is now because even though i can sign petitions or protest ultimately i have no voting representation to help influence a resource that i enjoy both recreationally and that is essential to my and my future generations livelihood made this cmv because im sure there are downsides to managing this at the state level i would like to hear those and consider whether they would outweigh the positives this has gotten a lot of traction thanks for all the discussion im sorry if i didnt get to everyone ive definitely learned its a complicated situation im not really swayed by fears of corruption or tyranny etc since that can happen at any level of government some people have pointed out that bottling is small compared to agriculture ill concede that it is probably a smaller impact than other industries but that doesnt weigh on the larger point of whether water for all industries should be regulated by state or not  also interesting to consider whether the water should belong to those whose land it is on or redistributed to everyone equally this consideration is the most intriguing to me and i think there are good arguments for both i think part of the problem is that water is just too cheap which leads it to be overused i believe it should be taxed at either the local or state level so that use is paid for proportional to the amount taken,1,599,3752,50,0.08

nbsp for example infamously stated  on tape  that you know i’m automatically attracted to beautiful — i just start kissing them it’s like a magnet i just kiss i don’t even wait and when you’re a star they let you do it you can do anythinggrab them by the pussy you can do anything on top of trump being accused of sexually harassing women and making lewd comments about their appearances on record ivana trump also accused the president of raping her 
nbsp moore  yes moore lost the senate race last night but he was never pressured enough to actually leave the race as many again not all republicans supported him and moore has been accused of sexual harassingassaulting several women according to the new york daily news a retired alabama police officer said she was told to keep an eye on republican senate candidate roy moore back in the 1980s because he was known to harass teenage cheerleaders at local school ballgameswe were also told to watch him at the ballgames and make sure that he didn’t hang around the cheerleaders faye said the rumor was that roy moore likes young girls she added it was not only in our department but at the courthouse too 
nbsp also seem split on whether farenthold should resign even though according to the nyt he was sued over accusations of sexual harassment three years ago paid out an 84000 settlement financed by taxpayers and has an open ethics committee investigation into his behavior yet only a few republicans have called for his resignation
nbsp seems the only republican forced to resign among sexual conduct allegations is trent franks is there something im missing im genuinely confused
nbsp first of all thank you to everyone thus far who has commented andor discussed this topic with me im learning a lot from this conversation one issue thats been frequently coming up is proof vs allegation a common argument thats been made is that republicans require proof before relinquishing support whereas democrats do not in frankens case theres a photograph of him groping a sleeping woman the proof is there but i wonder if franken were a republican would his party stop backing him theres also the argument of allegation vs conviction while farenthold wasnt convicted he did settle a sexual harassment lawsuit with taxpayer money doesnt that to at least some extent factor into proof of the allegation someone mentioned that resigning is an admittance of guilt like in both conyers and frankens case but isnt settling a lawsuit with money also an admittance of guilt

cmv forcing a child to finish everything on their plate creates an unhealthy relationship with food,"making a child eat everything on their plate will in one way or another damage someones view on food    have seen this outcome often and its usually expressed in a few ways people dont stop eating when they are full i dont want to offend anyone but a lot of the people i know who struggle with their weight been brought up in homes where they werent allowed to leave the table until they had cleaned their plates 
2 meal time becomes a chore or downright unpleasant when i went to stay with my father and his partner she would make me eat everything on my plate i didnt portion the food out myself and it was often food that she wouldnt eat and that i hated meal time became me taking an hour to eat something because i was gagging between bites i know people who are very picky eaters because they were forced as children to eat food that made them feel sick
3 people who have small appetites will portions out less for themselves because being hungry is better than feeling sick  
4 it creates fear of going without if you dont finish you wont get anything else can sound like im going to punish you for not finishing by leave you out  
5 it makes someone a picky eater youre going to stick to what you like if youre going to be made to eat all of it 
6 food becomes a reward if you eat everything youll get dessert this creates two problems for some people its ive been good i can have this and for some people its i havent been good enough so i cant have this 
7 it can cause a dislike for certain foods sometimes to the point of a phobia in the same household i was often fed soggy fatty bacon that was cooked in a microwave if i even smell bacon cooking it makes me feel sick and this is more than a decade later i have encountered this with many people i know who cant stand different dishes or ingredients a child should be encouraged to try everything more than once without the pressure to eat all of it and if they genuinely dont like it then thats ok also if a child doesnt manage to finish then they can eat it another day  finish your soup scientific paper

cmv a doctor telling their patient that they need to lose weight shouldnt be considered fat shaming,"i dont believe that anyone should be shamed for their body but i dont believe that a doctor telling a patient that losing weight will improve their health counts as fat shaming with the exception of those who are forced into obesity by a health defect i believe obesity completely preventable honestly it seems downright irresponsible that a doctor would not inform someone whose health is hurt by their weight that they need to change something its never a bad idea to be sensitive about it but you cant simply let someone continue to damage their health to avoid hurt feelings
 added some examples below
 






 be clear i do understand that in some cases a doctor dismissing a patients symptoms as a result of their weight can lead to serious health issues going ignored and thats definitely not okay my issue is simply with patients who are told to lose weight in a clinical not crude way taking as shaming  wow didnt expect to wake up to this many responses going through everyones comments now
 my view has been partially changed while i do still believe that its the responsibility of a doctor to bring up the subject of your weight if its significant enough to become a risk to your health regardless of whether or not its the main reason for your visit because they are there to look after your health ive also seen that theres a fundamental flaw with simply telling a patient they need to lose weight without exploring why it is that theyre struggling with it to begin with theres always the possibility its just down to laziness but depression lack of nutritional knowledge and several other things are more common than i realized as underlying issues 
 for people feeling shamed and angry because they have other issues which go ignored because they are automatically dismissed as a result of their weight while i still believe this is a separate issue from my question as that was about patients feeling shamed simply because it was brought up they could benefit from losing some weight rather than only mentioning their weight regardless of other issues this seems to be much more common than i believed i intend to research more about it but i assumed as clinically trained professionals it had to be a rare phenomenon i still think in many of these cases weight management could probably have reduced symptoms or allowed an earlier diagnosis but clearly its an issue regardless i do also see how this could understandably but people on the defensive enough about their weight so that even when their issue is addressed if weight is brought up afterwards or in addition to it their feelings could be hurt enough that in their mind that was the focus of the visit ",1,473,2971,102,0.0392156862745098
cmv that alpha male v beta male concept in humans is bullshit,there are entire industries that exploit the false idea of alphas and betas in human beings but in reality it is a cheap scam  the idea is overly vague and also sexist argue that only the people usually men who watch videos about “being alpha” on the internet know very much about this concept because it is in reality not a good descriptor of the actual happenings between people in the real world concept is also too vague if you research the concept of alpha what you will get is a myriad of men and women listing different occasionally contradictory and extremely vague concepts this essentially amounts to being told to be confident  concept is sexist as well as the concept depends on a rigid definition of what a “man” can be and also assumes that women lack autonomy when around an “alpha” man  are many other reasons why this concept is wrong and harmful but this is just a few of them my position is that this concept does not describe interactions between humans in a meaningful way and honestly we should move on to more useful and accurate concepts,1,194,1110,64,0.125
cmv the elimination of plastic drinking straws in 1st world countries will have little or no effect on the environment,"alright to begin with i should state is bad and it would be better to recycle straws or use a biodegradable material instead is bad and is having a detrimental effect on sea birds turtles etc  food chains should work towards producing less waste  you live in a developed country your garbage does not end up in the ocean it goes from your latte to the trash can to the dumpster to a truck to a landfill time a business advertises itself as straw free they always put up pictures of sea turtles and link to photos of pacific ocean garbage patches  plastic straws and cutting your plastic 6pack rings is a nice sentiment but its insignificant compared to other sources of pollution eg excessive plastic wrap on new products 
 please see ucitizenjacks comment about how small insignificant changes can actually backfire due to the fact that human psychology sucks lets continue to eliminate waste but not fool ourselves baby steps are not enough and are just being used as advertising by the big polluters  article that sums things up nicely posted by utamyacct

cmv no matter how good the intentions are behind it no restriction of free speech is a good idea,"now i should note that this primarily focuses on hate speech laws but anything really in this sense can apply lets get started im primarily speaking about laws preventing the expression of beliefs primarily politically clarification im speaking about laws akin to hate speech laws not like the promotion of crime etc
recently ive been in an onandoff argument with a close friend over hate speech laws her argument is that hate speech laws do more good than harm as they protect targeted minorities and prevent the spread of racist andor otherwise opinions part of her argument is also that if i support hate speech why do i believe it should be legal should make it brutally clear im not a minority in any senses other than that im transgender and lesbian however i wouldnt make my opinion a double standard even if it was attacking me belief
the right to free speech should in no way be impeded or changed now i believe this for a couple of key reasons more profreespeech oriented
     giving away any right to the government for any reason cannot be taken back imagine if we handed away the fourth amendment the cops could barge in any old time without reason
     giving the right to silence permanently opens the door to governmentsponsored censorship
         as such by giving the power to do so to the government you inherently put it into the hands of the wrong person someone with the intent to silence other opinions regardless of theirs
     a society without truly free expression will be like a twentyfive year old kept in a sterile room their entire life  the common cold will leave them deathly ill what im trying to say is if society is never exposed to differing arguments said differing arguments will spread like the plague
     people who are silenced always speak louder than their silencer meaning that ideas will spread quicker and likely underground limiting free speech will inherently bring a new free thought renaissance more specific arguments against hate speech laws
     ive seen absolutely no evidence in any arguments supporting these that they curb the tide of hate speech hell even in europe where hate speech laws are rampant identitarian movements and other hatebased beliefs are growing exponentially
     what is determined as profane and offensive is extremely situational and as such theres no proper way to parameterize it what im trying to say here is that a specific ruling will either bring in a lot of falsepositives or will create a lot of falsenegatives too restricted speech will silence the incorrect people too lax will let hate speech run free
         a recent example of a falsepositive would be count dankula the dude who taught his dog to perform the nazi salute this sounds bad but in reality he was performing a baseline juxtaposition for the sake of comedy its extremely unlikely he actually believes in nazism
     you cannot get rid of hate speech laws once you have them after all wouldnt removing them be siding with hate speech
     again if the wrong people get this power there is strong potential the table will be flipped and say your very own views will get silenced
     hate speech laws based off offense will bring in more false positives than anything anyone can get offended at anything rather easily itll be the witch hunts all over again more specific arguments against her argument
     the ability for hateful opinions to be expressed is a small price to pay to ensure i will forever be allowed to express mine
     my support of the legality of an activity does not inherently mean i support the practice myself  i dont personally agree with or support hate speech but i dont care how vile and insensitive your opinion may be i might not support it or agree with it but by god ill defend your right to say it until the end of days as i expect the same courtesy

cmv hard times create strong men strong men create good times good times create weak men weak men create hard times,"lets put this in the context of history to be specific for example times when governments with authoritative policies are put into power when the previous government usually a democracy is destabilized alternatively when an authoritative government which was meant to keep things in order starts becoming too oppressive people will eventually start fighting for a more democratic one to replace it  also think that warsdeathsuffering are inevitable when this process is taking place as long as resources are finite and people are different there will be no end to conflict thus keeping the cycle happening professor said that perhaps the wars and other conflicts need not happen that maybe we can live in a world of perpetual good times and strong people and break the cycle suggesting that there might be a solution to this i on the other hand think that this philosophy is an essential part to the human experience to learn the importance of struggle and the foolishness of being contented is not something you can just write down and teach the younger generation its something that they themselves have to experience as well which is why history keeps repeating itself

i hate restaurantscompanies that only have facebook pages rather than a website,i deleted facebook in 2011 and since never looked back and if anything so glad that i did  issue now fb is so integrated into day to day life people only use that for advertising  hate getting emails about win this product then you read how to enter and they say like usfollow us and re post us on facebook to be entered  a restaurant which is fb only and clicking the link you are greeted with a million log in screens and limited information  this is a rubbish way to get to your target audience and i avoid companies who solely use fb 001 spelling 002 wow yeah so this early sunday morning post has got a lot more upvotes than i expected thank you all  still reading all of the comments but here are some updates to some of the more common comments ive read so far  i do get small businesses depend on fb as its free also its great to have transparency for reviews from genuine consumers being able to openly read these comments would be great  but these arent always visible to nonfb users question can the fb page owner just delete commentsreviews or is this like ebay in which you have to appeal them yes professional websites do cost a lot  agreed with digital ecommerceseo required this can be difficult for smaller businesses to get into  but there are lots of free domain services with easy to use guis similar user experiences that they would find when using fb pages to set upmaintain that also display in google searchs  a few comments saying i must not be the target audience  this is a bit of a tricky one as context matters the reason i posted this was due to a bbq restaurant about 1 hour away from where i live that i wanted to eat at today with my gf im 30 love food especially bbq and have spare disposable income to spend eating out  how am i not the perfect target audience  the reason i was looking for a website which lead me directly to there facebook page was to find info about covid restrictions whats in the menu pricing and if i could book a table  the fb page had limited information without having to log in seems like a lot of people use fake facebook profiles to get around things like this personally i dont really like the idea of making fake profiles for anything  ill update further once ive read more of the comments my app notifications have gone wild definitely brightened up my sunday thanks reddit ✌️,0,453,2465,81,0.037037037037037035

most soldiers do not “fight for our rights” but rather fight for money a career or by compulsion from a draft,the last war that was really about “our rights” was the civil war vietnam wwi ii korea iraq and afghanistan were really about global power dynamics the soldiers that fought in these wars were not defending our rights because our rights were not really being threatened this has been very interesting a few points to address	a repeat theme is that ww2 was about american rights i politely disagree the us entered only after being attacked and having its global position threatened we had no choice we had been declining for 5 years to enter the war now i guess it’s very true that many people joined the military after pearl harbor out of a sense of duty but i just have a hard time seeing how it was a war for our rights it was 100 a just war but much of the justification was learned of only after the fact most americans didn’t know of the atrocities happening at concentration camps 	i never said there was anything wrong with joining for any reason other than patriotic duty join for whatever reason i’m all for it 	this last point is very important many have said that without the military we wouldn’t have all these freedoms and rights so they therefore are fighting for our freedoms and rights by simply existing this is an interesting notion because from my vantage point as an american our military is the most powerful it has ever been yet i have seen a steady derogation of american rights and freedoms throughout my entire life  from within being a super power does not somehow make our freedoms more secure it’s actually the opposite imo the lack of a credible threat means our government can actually take away our rights without being checked look at china and russia where it’s happening today and has happened for a while look at the last 12 years in the us increased surveillance portland police brutality etc,0,327,1887,112,0.008928571428571428

until sentenced the name face and information of the accused should not be released publicly,"this way anyone falsely accused does not get their name dragged through the sand until they have been convicted we have made it too easy to destroy peoples lives on false accusations i believe protecting the innocent is just as important as prosecuting the guilty the only downside would be if someone had evidence on the accused but this could also be found as a part of the investigation process maybe a better definition if the initial hearing is not dismissed and the judge wants to pursue the case further i just dont think its fair to lose your job over something thats dismissed in 5 minutes in court because thats all someone with a false accusation wants thanks for the gold it seems the general consensus is that we all hate to see innocent peoples lives ruined thank you for restoring my faith in humanity a little the main counter argument in my own words  the government can abuse this by silently incarcerating and sentencing people and it has been written into law us to release a public record of these events so my main problem with this argument is firstly i was referring to protecting innocent people from a false accusation not from a tyrannical government if you are being targeted by a tyrannical government i dont think you really care about slander and being cancelled however i did not know the reason behind this legislation in the us so i appreciate the info what we should really define is at what point during the legal process does a public record get released what forms of evidence are needed obviously video footage over word of mouth the whole point of the legal system is you really cant trust people to tell the truth doesnt matter because until you catch them in a lie you cant tell the difference can the media be sued for slander if they publish articles that corroborate a false accusation without doing enough research should they be forced to remove these articles or publically renounce any false information these are all questions that came to mind when reading your comments again my main goal is protecting innocent citizens from the horrors of mob justice i keep seeing sweden pop up in my notifications tab so shout out to sweden for protecting the innocent if this opinion was popular innocent people wouldnt have their lives ruined by this i think we all know there is a problem and i am glad this post can foster discussion on the matter

porn addiction is a massive epidemic in men that society is choosing to ignore,"porn is being promoted as positive and a sort of ritual for men these days its deemed by most as a positive pastime and to critique it will be met with scorn and many will see you as against sex positivity for doing so it is seen by many as a private hobby with no harm to most except some complaining about misogyny towards women in porn
 as growing amounts of evidence show porn is having immensely negative effects on men many are becoming addicted to something encouraged and as safe by society men are having problems performing in bed with their partner reduced libidos fetishes they did not previously have which cause shame seeing women as sex objects solely having to watch more intense and degrading and even violent porn to get the same dopemine hit 
 men are also attaining erectile dysfunction where they cannot attain an erection without porn or even with porn studies into when people first locate porn shows most boys begin watching at around the age of 910 the beginning of their sexuality is being distorted and twisted in their formative years when they are vulnerable to an addiction they have no idea about there are also studies showing that porn consumption causes anxiety and depression in its users 
 are literally hundreds of thousands of men now coming forward largely on the internet due to the stigmas of this addiction with their stories how has this been received well as a joke an ex porn addict went on tv and told a presenter telling him his addiction did not exist that his penis could no longer get hard academics researching this area have been mocked and ridiculed for their research
 problem is only getting worse and if not addressed very soon will probably become one of the greatest concerns for our society on a social level it will possibly reach an epidemic proportion as men in possibly their millions will be addicted to something very very hard to quit and the assistance in fixing this issue will be very difficult and very expensive 

 you are a man who has a positive relationship with porn then thats fine but this post is to show the unpopular opinion being ignored by society 
 out no fap and porn free if you want to see what men are having to silently endure at the moment
 realized i fucked up the title my point was that if porn addiction is not addressed and started to be dealt with now i believe in mere decades we could have an epidemic on our hands also i swear to god i put this in the post but if you watch porn and are not an addict i am truly happy for you i am also pro masturbation and sex positive my point is for a sizeable number of people porn is addictive and this reality needs to be known and we need to help porn addicts i hope this clarifies everything

the buff teenagers played by twenty year olds are incredibly detrimental to teenager’s self esteem,it’s impossible to watch something nowadays that’s aimed towards teens without these portrayals this is creating massive delusions for young teenagers in terms of what they think they will look like or should look like and it’s terrible it should be banned they are designed to be idolised or even sexualised and displayed as desired so what do think it does to a person who doesn’t look like that why tf are people saying “well we can’t have real children fucking each other so we have to have pretend children fucking instead” like that’s okay what the hell that’s so messed up why would you think that children having sex is ok if they’re not children just labelled as children seek help,0,122,706,99,0.010101010101010102

a lot of the television shows using fully adult actors in a high school setting could easily change their plot to revolve around a college setting instead of the weird fixation television has on displaying the sex lives of high schoolers,i think a good example of this is the show riverdale if you don’t know it’s a show using the characters of archie comics in a teen murder drama ish show in that show their lives are about whatever big mystery is going on their relationships and their friends the characters in the show are highschool age 16 i believe but a majority of the cast are actors in their midtwenties one actor is almost 29  the show or as much as i’ve seen being an actual high school student occupies very little of the character’s lives and the aspects of high school we do see the characters participate it could more or less be translated into a college setting so why even make them high school students i know to reach a youth audience and whatever but seeing how a lot of this shows content displays varied sexual relationships between characters i feel like it’s a bit weird seeing all these high school age relationships so graphically being acted by much older people  i’m realizing now that riverdale isn’t the best example a plot point of season 1 is an inappropriate teacher student relationship but there are a lot of shows like this out i think hollywood should stop fetishizing high school sexual relationships when they really don’t have to my issue with it isn’t so much the displays of sex more that the show creators are leaning so heavily into all the displays of sex of people who are supposed to be minors gives a weird voyeurism vibe if the plot allows just make the setting college it would even make more sense with the plots sometimes i have no issue with sex being a plot point in teenoriented television but the mentality of “we have 27 year olds playing 16 year olds so let’s shoot this soft core porn scene because we can 😎” is very problematic and approaching borderline pedophilic restructured as paragraphs for clarity 2 i understand not all viewers relate to college this was merely a possible suggestion to a pretty pervasive issue in television,0,353,2025,237,0.004219409282700422

young men opting out of society to play video games and focus on their hobbies are  acting completely reasonable,there are a lot of whiny articles recently about how men dont go to university at the same rate as young women dont work as many hours as they used to and in general participate less in society and rather play video games or something this naturally comes at the expense of traditional life attainments such as working yourself to death having an insanely expensive wedding and being the sole provider for a family that will eventually kick you out a few examples a ring on it millennial couples are in no hurry new york times are millennials putting off marriage let me count the ways washington post men are the real reason women are having children later the spectator culture isn’t the real problem facing singles today it’s math washington post millennials in their 30s are unmoored from the institution of family institute for family studies lost boys video games more fun than growing up the globe and mail you read through these articles you will find that the theme is men bad because they refuse to play the social role written for them its mostly from the perspective of how this creates problems for women in the long run but still thats the core of it to what these journalists would have you believe i think these young men are acting completely rationally when opting out of this life script there just arent enough incentives to play this role it is too risky and too exhausting and i can personally see how one would derive way more satisfaction from hanging out with ones mates playing video games or being in a band young men dont owe society anything we should just live and let live and let people enjoy their lives in the way they want to instead of judging them you want to wander off further into cringetopia make sure to check this out makes men better the economic benefits of settling down mercatornet science explains the common mans fear of settling down in love elite daily what he does online that matters most gaming porn and relationship quality institute for family studies share of americans not having sex has reached a record high washington post sex recession could lead to an economic depression cnbc you all very much for the positive feedback and the support here im really glad to see that we both men and women can actually have a productive and civil discussion and that men are there to stand up for each other also thanks for all the awards never had that before,0,430,4012,116,0.008620689655172414

 example the bureau of census reports that the average price of a new home in june 1998 was 175900 to inflation that price today should be 271931 the same report places the average sale price for june 2018 at 368500 however more than 35 higher than the price when accounting for inflation alone  gallon of gas in 1994 cost 106 making it 164 in june 2014 when adjusted for inflation the actual national average price as of july 2018 is 288 – 75 higher than what it would be if inflation were the only cause for the increase median household income in 1998 was 38885 the most recent year with full data available is 2017 so adjusting for inflation as of that year gives a median income of 58487 the bureau of census reports that the actual median 2017 income was 59000 – higher than the adjusted figure but not by very much and certainly nowhere near the percentage that prices have outpaced inflation did not happen by accident  this happened because of greed ceo salary and shareholder profits have outstripped wages and cost of living by a factor of between 3 and 8 depending on the source you read  truly have it harder than our parents did	we cannot afford to put ourselves through school working a part time job  they could 	we cannot afford to have one parent stay at home  they could 	we cannot afford to buy a house on a single income  they could  yet boomers have the audacity to tell us that we need to just work harder pull ourselves up by our boot straps that were lazy and entitled  were not the data shows that millennials work just as hard as our parents generation but we struggle more  years now when boomers have told us youre lazy and entitled and we need to just work harder weve tried to explain this to them  and they dont listen  learned that theres no point in trying to convince them  nothing will change their mind so now we just say ok boomer

men dont conceal their depression because they are afraid being seen as less of a man they conceal because no one gives a fuck,"as bill burr once said ladies your issues may not get resolved but at least people give a fuck  its true women have support systems for their depression they have systems in place and people are much more prone to be sympathetic to women and dont want to see a woman suffering people want to help and show they are not alone
 for men we are alone partially because of the traditional view that men cannot show weakness but the biggest reason is no one cares people dont just not care they distance themselves from you men and women will just walk away or show a miniscule amount of compassion men know that expressing our depression or darker thoughts is a terrible idea because it will make matters worse not better 
 is this modern trend that traditional gender roles cause men not to talk about this i think thats a small component of the reason but its because most of us know if we come forward with our issues the people around us and society at large will largely shun us therefore we bottle it in and deal with it by ourselves not because we are afraid of not looking like real men but because we know we are alone in this struggle and if we open up we will lose so so much",0,226,1224,129,0.015503875968992248

science is a really fun subject but the combination of a poorly made curriculum and a boring teacher is the reason alot of students hate science,science is by far the most interesting subject as it is the study of the smallest things in the universe all the way to the biggest and brightest things it also teaches how the universe works and how things on earth work however the reason many students find it boring is because the curriculum doesnt do a good job at explaining these things and instead teaches very specific things rather then a summary of the subject if it wasnt this way then it would make kids want to further learn about their preferred science  in my personal experience and from what ive seen online most people get sucky teachers who dont do a good job at making science fun,0,120,666,146,0.00684931506849315
disney is overrated and people are brainwashed into loving it more than they should,there is no legitimate reason why best animated film is going to disney every single year almost without fail since the award was invented in 2001 2017 is probably the best example for this the two greatest animated films that year were loving vincent and the breadwinner loving vincent was revolutionary in terms of medium having each frame be a full oil painting it also told a beautiful story and the cinematography was magnificent breadwinner was also a magnificent story about a middle eastern girl searching for her father either of these films should have won best animated picture but they didnt they lost to coco dont get me wrong coco was good almost great even but it was nowhere near as revolutionary nor as important a story as loving vincent or the breadwinner coco won simply because it was disney pixar the only reason disney is winning every year is because they are overrated and super well known whereas these other films are indie films but the best picture shouldnt go to a film because of the company that produces it but rather because of the quality and importance of the films itself indie films and 2d animated films continually get stumped by disney for best animated picture in fact only once did a 2d film win and only once did a foreighn film win and that one time for both of those was when spirited away won in 2002 never again has a 2d or foreign film won and never has an indie film won  is a fucking scam its a 1984 community that feels so eerily unsettling and inhuman they brainwash people with their slogans like happiest place on earth and they cover up anything bad from their audience not to mention the corporate greed and the continuous raising of prices for tickets disney also own half of anaheim city and most of the nearby hotels and motels are secretly owned by disney some goes for the nearby gas stations diners etc disney pretty much runs the city of anaheim in secrecy and the anaheim government is perfectly fine with that because they get big paychecks out if it disneyland isnt even as great as everyone says it is the only reasons people go so much is because people are sad and where better to go than what is advertised as the happiest place on earth people take their kids there because they think that their kids have to go to disneyland at least once to have a good quality childhood people i know seem to go to disneyland often simply to show how fucking rich and well off they are theyre using disneyland as a way to express their higher class not as a way to actually enjoy themselves walt disney imagined a utopia but it seems to me that he got a dystopia instead he wanted to use his money for good for human progress in technology but instead the company hoards it and just uses the money to get even more money imagine the good charity that the company could do with their money that is what walt wanted he wanted money for the people not for the corporation at disney is terrible if you work in animation any drawing you produce at the time whether on duty or not are the property of disney this prevents people from being able to do freelance or to work for other companies at the same time this also means that theres vaults of cartoon porn that disney owns because the artists draw shit like that for shits and giggles if you work at disneyland they treat you like shit and they dont pay well either but hey you get free tickets so its all good sarcasm disney oppresses their employees and they get away with it all the time because they have big money  is continuously fighting their competition until they win and they almost alwats win and by competition i dont mean enemies but allies too this can be seen in the sony argument where disney continually demands more and more until smaller companies have to give in because they know that they cant make it opposing such a powerful entity this is what happened with spiderman as disney got greedy and started demanding more profits and sony said no so disney broke off their deal until sony finally gave in because theyd make even less money if they cut ties with disney all together than if they gave them most of the profits for spiderman this bullshit has been pulled off so many times by disney is taking over the film industry and the marketing industry and it pisses me off so much that almost everyone is just ok with that disney also keeps producing films that stump smaller films in awards because the game is rigged in favor of bigger entities movies like frozen brave the incredibles etc are only popular because of the company that is making them not because of the quality of the films itself people expect a disney film to be good and oftentimes peoples opinions will be biased based on what they go in expecting people need to support smaller companies and indie companies more often than they do before there arent any left to support,0,890,5023,84,0.011904761904761904

nuclear energy is in fact better than renewables for both us and the environment ,"hello everyone this is gonna be a bit longer so if you are not interested in a long read feel free to scroll to tldr  to begin with i believe a bit of background about myself is appropriate so that people have an idea about where this all comes from i am 24 just finishing my masters degree in inorganic chemistry this year ever since i was little i have always been baffled regarding the opinions many people had about such issues i ended up in a lot of fights with people who were also very concerned about the environment over the years which mostly didnt achieve much which has really troubled me because the facts are clear but for some unknown reason at the time no one seemed to get it the goal of this post is to get it off me and hopefully show as many people as possible what the reality is i will try to distinguish as clearly as possible among the pure data and my own opinions in this piece by no means am expert in this field but i have a decent understanding of all the field which play the part in this thermodynamics electrical engineering energy sources and a bit of high energy physics first thing people should understand is the basics of energy distribution our entire energy grid is the result of the fact that energy generation is an extremely inefficient process in a common power grid around 68 of energy is lost before it gets to your home every means apart from solar panels  is dependent on a generator that generates electricity by faradays law of induction without getting technical what happens is that when you move magnets and conductors next to one another electricity is generated what happens in the reality that some sort of fuel produces gasses commonly water vapor which has very good properties for this that spin a massive machine with magnets around a huge coil this machine is a state of the art costs loads of money and all of that is worth it to not lose as much energy as we would otherwise the rest of the grid is made to accommodate this electricity is made in huge power plants because they are more efficient than small ones distributed more densely to reduce the losses in transmission all the power is converted to very high voltages which itself costs billions in infrastructure and maintenance have established that all we need from the fuel is to spin the rotor the moving part of the generator  so which one is the best as in everything in life there are tradeoffs but some combinations are definitely better than others is a small overview of common energy sources solar energy  one outsider there is no spinning involved it is surprisingly bad for nature the manufacturing and disposal of solar panels are very dirty and energyintensive  they also have a very short life high volatility both throughout the year and wether depending and not the best efficiency the only reasonable use of solar panels in my opinion is to put in on rooftops for house heating or in 3rd world countries where infrastructure doesnt give any alternatives
 wind energy  apart from destroying the landscape it is also very volatile in contrary to popular opinion very fast winds are actually not a good thing is it strains the bearings greatly simplified and has to be actually slowed down what you want are consistent faster winds the efficiency if good up to 40 
 geothermal energy  sadly not very viable on a large scale but with good geothermal sources very very good you basically get pressurized steam there are lots of types let us omit the technicalities that you dont have to do much with before pushing into the generator
 fossil fuels  coal natural gas oil  they are very dirty and i mean very very dirty depending on the coal used varies a lot it actually often produces more radioactive waste than nuclear powerplants scary i know that waste is either ash or gets dispersed in the exhaust from the plant mostly radioactive carbon uranium and thorium the sad thing is we need these plants they are the only ones that can quickly react to energy needs and basically stabilize the entire grid at around 35 efficiency depending on many factors they are not a huge win but cheap versatile provide most of the electricity
 nuclear power  most of the people dont understand where the energy comes from so this will be a quick walkthrough many have you know or have seen the famous equation by einsteins e  mc2 what it means is that there is some sort of equivalency between energy and mass and that is exactly where nuclear energy is from a very small amount of mass is converted into huge amounts of energy when the atoms are split it has many disadvantages such as nuclear waste constant output very high building costs etc but it produces clean energy yeah hard to believe i will talk about in detail below and very low price is where the comparison between renewables and nuclear comes unpopular fact is that nuclear energy is about 2x 3x cleaner than solar and wind most of the difference comes down to the fact that building windmills and solar panels is expensive energydemanding resources demanding they dont last very long but most importantly they produce very little energy for all that the nuclear power plant is very expensive to build but after that it produces very little waste more on this later and a huge amount of energy if we were to calculate in the cost of manufacturing and disposal of these power sources and normalize it to the energy output it turns out that it produces around 23 times less co2 while being significantly cheaper eg if we were to replace a nuclear power plant by renewables we would both hurt the nature and pay twice the money for it while not including in that the nuclear plant is built already people have a large number of concerns about anything that contains the word nuclear this personally saddens me as i believe it comes partly from not understanding and partly from the media turning it into the big thing for instance mri that we all know from hospitals are correctly called nmr standing for nuclear magnetic resonance but people were scared of it being called nuclear and just turned down the procedure without even listening so they call it mri instead it still works the same quickly comment on most common fears about nuclear plants it will explode  well there is always a small possibility the problem is that people are terrible with big numbers and statistics in reality nuclear plans are immensely safe nowadays with great oversight and many precautions a catastrophic failure is pretty much a nonissue
 but chernobyl  it isnt actually such a big deal as media make it i am not saying it wasnt a true tragedy but objectively it isnt something that could possibly happen in a modern power plant everything went pretty much as poorly as possible approximately 4000 people have died as a result well the flu kills 10 000 people only in the usa annually estimated traffic deaths around the world are about 1 250 000 people annually does chernobyl seem that bad now
 the nuclear waste is a terrible thing  well yes and not you see radioactivity is very natural even bananas are slightly radioactive they contain potassium nuclear waste is encased in huge casks made out of steel concrete etc it isnt something that just leaks radiation everywhere they are immensely durable safe and well maintained most of the people have never been to the nuclear powerplant i have been to the reactor itself without any protection you can just walk above the pool with the nuclear waste that is hot and fresh from the reactor excursion are allowed to people workingstudying the field while the reactor is in maintenance to change fuel pellets the radiation isnt much and just water yeah just regular water can pretty much contain it all that happens is that the water is a bit blueish people usually dont understand about renewables manufacturing of renewables is no green not it the slightest  silicon isnt as clean to make its not just sand phosphorous isnt either titanium coating aluminum i am not against chemical not in the slightest you just have to but purifying the silicon takes energy a lot of energy so does other stuff and disposing of them is hell
 wind and solar do help one another but they are still immensely volatile dependant on the part of the year and local weather if you have a little bit of them its ok but if you start to add serious amount of them in the electric grid it becomes a problem you see energy consumption is not always the same and we have to be able to react to it so we want to make energy when we need it not when it pleases this is the reason huge pumpstorage hydro facilities exist they use overflow nuclear electricity during the night to pump water up and in the highest demand produce some of the electricity back
 renewables are nonscalable as you add more turbines there are only worse and worse spots you need huge batteries to defend the grid from their volatility huge ones you would run out of lithium to cover entire worlds needs truth is it just isnt happening
 all of these are not imaginary statements they are real lets have a look at an example france vs germany both of these are wealthy countries where people care about the environment but they took very different routes germany went renewable mostly wind some solar about 35  of their total energy is renewable so how are they doing their energy is expensive very expensive twice the price of frances energy so at least they are not producing co2 right well they do a lot more than france even if you normalize it on energy produced and the worst thing is that the gap is getting bigger why because renewables just cant scale efficiently anymore so what did the frace do right why is it cheaper and cleaner nuclear energy france gets almost 72 of energy from nuclear the highest in the world and it turns out it works what about the future then it all looks so grim again yes and no let me state that the proposed solution is to largely my own idea but i believe it is firmly based in reality and will most likely be the way it goes we will continue to heat up the planet in the foreseeable future we would have to basically give up the civilization otherwise the best way would be to have as much energy from nuclear energy as possible use other sources where it makes sense and simply wait until fusion is ready which it will be get ready to get excited  fusion is in some way a opposite of nuclear power plants what happens there is that heavy atoms are split using neutrons we call this fission what fusion does it the exact opposite it uses light elements and fuses them together which converts mass into energy the great news about it is that it is using hydrogen deuterium and tritium two isotopes that arent so common but still easy to get from oceans and lithium to cover humanity for thousands of years there is no possibility of an explosion not even theoretical no waster just clean and pure energy that sounds awesome why dont we have it yet the thing is its not quite that simple there are more models etc by for sake of simplicity what we pretty much need to do is create a small sun yep the sun is using hydrogen as fuel and makes helium as a wastehelium from helios which means sun in ancient greek but in the last decade fusion energy has come a long way and with iter being finished in 5 years approximately the fun will start iter is a most expensive project ever to be built in human history and it will be the first fusion reactor that will work and produce energy it is still for research but will be net positive where does all of my certainty come from i have been to some lectures from the cern physicists about fusion as well as a big fan for years fusion is a huge technological challenge but all the fields required have immensely advanced and that is why it will succeed the fusion is simple if you can use gravity the fuel just presses itself and fusion beings well that isnt an option for us so what will we do  we take a very very very hot plasma millions of degrees and compress it this makes fusion start but starting it isnt the problem sustaining is it is so hot that you need to hold it levitating in the electromagnetic field you have to control huge temperature gradients changes in temperature over short distances there are numerous challenges for which you need huge and powerfull magnets incredible shielding superconducting cables high energy physics the physics of hot plasma very advanced robotics for maintenance etc but it will happen with a clean source of cheap energy a lot of problems we have will have very good solutions and i am very much looking forward to it we have our best people on in way smarter and more dedicated than you or i has stretched out more than i expected without really getting into the details if this thread catches on i might expand it while reply to some of the interesting questions thanks everyone for reading renewable resources are not scalable in reality and will never fulfill the needs of humanity the sad reality is that nowadays we are using mostly fossil fuels and heading to the direction that doesnt have a promising future nuclear energy is vastly cheaper while being 23x more ecofriendly that renewables most of what people know or think they know about these sources is grossly misplaced and media are only feeding into it these arent just theoretical thoughts but the reality of current france and germany is the best example france has almost threequarters of its energy from nuclear and is 2nd best ecowise country in the world 1st from only energy standpoint it produces way less co2 per kw energy than germany this disparity is only increasing while having around twice as cheap energy as many people have brought up a couple of things i will go over them quickly nuclear plant safety just to give an idea of what would have to happen for a nuclear plant to explode gravity would have to stop working the reactors are nowadays constructed in this way the nuclear fuel is in vertical rods in the reactor covered with water above it huge control rods hang on electromagnets in the case of anything happening the control rods will be released and fall into the reactor there they will absorb the neutrons which cause the fission and stop the reaction in seconds they can be used to control the reaction by partially lowering them into the reactor which will slow the radioactive fission
 nuclear waste this indeed is a problem but not very different than people imagine it is pretty much just ok to bury it a couple km underground in a stable location it isnt the best solution in theory we could just launch it to the sun but when we are talking about the alternatives nuclear waste really doesnt pose a problem nowadays it is stored mostly in the plants themselves the pellets and loaded into a container covered with concrete and then have multiple other layers on top you can literally walk around the container and unless you are there every day nothing will happen
 thorium reactors instead of uranium thorium is a very similar element to uranium it has been brought up by many people and is argued to be safer which is partly true but doesnt really make a difference in reality i t is trued that thorium is theoretically superior to uranium with greater abundance  around 3x much easier use etc the main problem is that the uranium nuclear plant technology is wellmatured and researched it would take decades for all the research and prototyping for thorium to be finished for it to become widespread as we have enough uranium for the foreseeable future i think we should rather use the money to boost fusion research by the time we run out of uranium it will be likely so warm that it doesnt matter anymore unless fusion is adopted 2 as many people have brought mentioned land contaminated by chernobyl and sunnybunnybunbun did a great job going through some of the facts here it is furthermore oceans will rise and take more land if we dont stop global warming we cant revert the past but we can influence the future generate 1 megawatt of electricity heres how much land youd need using these energy sources  
 coal 12 acres  
 natural gas 12 acres  
 nuclear 12 acres  
 solar 43 acres  4x as much  
 wind 70 acres  6x as much  
 hydro 315 acres  26x as much and thats without counting the production of the materials involved and the disposal of them once they need to be replaced like you said solar panels are made from silicon making them or disposing of them is not a green process you count everything involved in production in the numbers explode from mits report here are the overall land requirements for each energy type if 100 of the electricity in the us were produced by these sources solar  33000 sq km  
 wind  66000 sq km  
 nuclear  440 sq km not a typo solar takes up 75x more space than nuclear and wind an astonishing 150x more this is not inconsequential this is land and its wildlife that is affected

people over 65 shouldnt get to run a country,trying to imagine my own grandfather running the country with the same ideals and standards and slightly outdated views that he picked up from his years in college and graduate school in the 1960s would be an absolute disaster hes an intelligent and progressive man and was very valuable in his field for years but soon became very disconnected from the direction the world was moving eventually you just run out of steam or become impatient with things and find it harder to learn new skills and adapt to new ways of thinking scandinavian countries with leaders who are younger and more in tune with the changes in society and the different challenges current youth and young adults are facing economically is incredibly valuable they seem to have an energy and drive to progress forward and it is so much more refreshing than watching these heavily aged candidates try and rally the country together in an effort to tie up their legacy before they die this was fun but i’m checking out now gotta make dinner i’m glad this provoked some controversy and conversation,0,184,1097,45,0.022222222222222223

overprotective parenting is an issue that doesnt get enough attention,parents going over the top on protecting their children is not only leading them on a direct path to be screwed as adults but also wastes their whole childhood kids need to go see friends at the park play video games and just have fun also keeping your child sheltered from everything slightly different from them is training them to be judgemental as a 16 yearold it honestly makes me sad to see classmates not being allowed to see their friends or have a phone and being totally oblivious to the world it baffles me how some parents think this is a good idea holy crap this blew up i saw alot of comments explaining how they like to shelter their little kids i should have mentioned this originally i meant more sheltering teenagers of course your 3 yearold will be sheltered hes 3 but its one thing to protect a toddler and another to limit a teenagers freedom,0,159,887,70,0.014285714285714285

pixar fucked up the first 10 minutes of up,"there i said it its been bugging me for 11 years people keep going on and on about those first ten minutes like they are the pinnacle of animation but in my mind i think pixar basically botched what couldve been one of the actual greatest animated moments i feel like those 10 minutes were always meant to be shown in the middle of the film almost as if they decided to make that sequence the opening as an afterthought   
 the first half of the film carl doesnt really open up to russell and we dont really know why hes so keen to get to paradise falls or why he cares so much about a stupid house except we do know since we watched the opening eventually we get a scene where carl alone enters the broken house and takes out an old photo album basically giving us another miniversion of the first ten minutes im convinced that in an earlier draft of the script the opening 10 minutes where intended to be shown during this scene and i believe that if it had played out like that the moment wouldve been 10 times more powerful than it is in the final film because then everything would click suddenly we would understand why this stubborn old man behaved the way he did the buildup would make that emotional punch much stronger  
 the way the film is now we go into the movie seeing a montage about a character we are yet to  care about and throughout the entire film we know everything about carls life and motivations making his reserved and introverted character pointless since we already understand it wouldve served better as a reveal later on

if you need religion to not be horrible person and to stop you from doing horrible things then you are a terrible person,hear me out been thinking about this opinion for a while now ever since ive hit my teenage years this is because my mom always tells me if it werent for god i wouldve insert messed up action so when i got older i realized just how messed up that actually is reason as to why it is messed up  is because you should be a good person based on your own moral code not religion what if that religion never existed what would you do if you all of a sudden didnt like religion anymore what would you do then would you go and kill people would rob banks would you do all the horrible things you wanted to do previously who think this way usually dont even know or care for the reason why they shouldnt do horrible things they only seem to not do awful things only because they think that something bad will happen to them based upon their religious belief to clarify this isnt to say that i hate people who believe in religion or think all people who use religion in their life think this way although i do personally despise religion as it has caused a lot of trouble in my life this is to say that i think if you use religion as your entire reason for not doing awful shit then you arent a good person in my eyes some of the things my mother has said were really bad she even said that she wouldve killed me and my siblings by now if it werent for god yeahreally smh way too many people keep saying that i think all people who are religious think this way not true im talking about a sizable amount of religious people who refrain from evil deeds simply because they fear harsh consequences based on their own religion i repeat not all people think this way but a sizable amount of people do 2 displaying my opinion the internet isnt edgy 3 dont disregard what i say simply because of my age if you think this way youre being closed minded edit this is a nuanced topic so there is a lot of room to debate here im okay with that however please try to be respectful to others in this thread and dont attack and insult people for their own beliefs on the matter everyone should try to learn something from thread about humanity morality and religion as a whole thanks for teaching me a few things here guys i appreciate it that being said may the debate continue,0,436,2449,123,0.008130081300813009

paparazzis should be able to get charged for harassment and the invasion of privacy by celebrities,"there is nothing okay about photographing people in public without consent the same should apply for celebrities
 you have something that puts you in the public eye a lot whether it’s your job or something to do with being part of a famous family and one day you’re going for a walk in the park when suddenly someone starts following you and taking pictures of you before you can even make direct eye contact with them just snapping photos of you like you’re some kind of landmark what will they do with those photos who knows not like it’s any of your business right
 put it in a different perspective what if you aren’t a celebrity you’re just some average joe on your way home would it be ok for someone to yell “hey smile ooh turn your head this way for me” whilst they start following and photographing you of course not that’s pretty much the definition of an invasion of privacy so why is it ok to do it to a celebrity and how well known do you have to be for them to get away with it
 genuinely hate the “oh well it’s just one of the side effects to being famous” answer no job or occupation should make it okay for people to snap photos of you whilst in public and doing stuff outside work
 at movie premieres the places paparazzis are actually expected to be at they take it too far by practically chasing them around whilst they try to leave the theatres half the time it’s done without the person even knowing that they’re being photographed such as those annoying articles nobody even cares about where they talk about what they saw demi lovato have at starbucks the other day nobody should have permission to make someone’s personal life public to everyone when they’re just doing the same thing as everyone else if i started following the guy who owns my local kfc and started posting pictures of them and writing articles about what they do in their free time on facebook then i’d probably get called a stalker and get sued for harassment but it’s fine if said person happens to be famous princess diana was indirectly killed by paparazzis because she got in a car crash whilst trying to get away from the swarm of people chasing her someone literally died because they were so focused on escaping a group of paid stalkers that their car ended up crashing are the literal scum of the earth the bottom of the food chain only able to survive by latching onto people with more money so that they can document the stuff that should be private they’re like secret spies except instead of finding out about the enemy’s secret weapons projects they’re filming someone’s daily life as if they’re one of the animals on a bbc documentary thing that i hate is when they make it sound like the celebrity is totally in on it and is intentionally attracting paparazzis for example when a celebrity is pregnant they say something like “insert name here shows off growing baby bump during walk in insert location” as if they’re getting up on a stage and telling everyone when actually they were just walking around whilst pregnant a pregnant woman isn’t “showing off” her belly just because you can see it she’s just walking around and surprise surprise it’s not really easy to hide your belly when it’s growing a mini person inside it

im a guy and i wish i could be pregnant,"i think pregnancy is wonderful i know its not all lollipops and rainbows i supported my wife every single day through her pregnancy and i helped her through the nausea the body aches and the terrible pain of giving birth i know there are risks and complications and its not something everyone wants to do i wish i could do it though
 wife and i agreed we wanted a baby as soon as we had a house thankfully she was able to become pregnant i really feel for the women who cant have babies and wish they could and we now have a toddler who is an absolute joy
 loved being pregnant every day we talked about the baby growing in her womb that we couldnt wait to meet i kissed her belly hundreds of times and i fell in love with her all over again every time i looked at her her hand was pretty much glued to her belly always rubbing it and humming a song the bond that is formed between the mother and child is simply beautiful
 hardest part about it is that ill never be able to realize this wish and i never had a choice in the matter women can choose in most cases whether or not they want to become pregnant and i dont know how the logistics of it all would work anyway maybe if we lived in a world where both men and women were built with the capability to have babies kind of like seahorses i know its not realistic but if it were possible to give me a uterus transplant id consider it i would go through considerable pain and effort if it meant i could get pregnant
 guy ive ever told has either looked at me like im insane or just straightup laughed at me women ive told seem to understand but nobody really takes it seriously except for my wife she knows its not a joke and that its an actual dream of mine any guys out there agree with me
 some people are rightfully pointing out that my wifes pregnancy went smoothly and that we are very fortunate i do not disagree however i disagree that i have an idealized view of pregnancy just because things went well for her does not mean they would for me and does not mean they go well for others but it also does not invalidate my feelings as i stated above i am wellinformed of the risks that come with pregnancy 2 no its not a sexual thing also to clarify i am happy as a straight male and i do not want to transition to become a woman",0,448,2388,40,0.075

 often they just want you to read biased views until you have the same opinion as them but they fail to understand that it’s not because you are uneducated as they’re suggesting but because you have looked at the facts and come to a different conclusion there are obviously some people who provide good sources to back up their viewpoints but i’m not talking about them similarly i’m not talking about people who give statistics on about people who make the general statement “educate yourself” i’m also talking about people who give links to opinion pieces on reputable sites or even sites with a straight up political bias like breitbart or vice 2  i am not talking about objective facts if it’s in terms of a disease your doctor told you to research or the infection rate of coronavirus then educate yourself is clearly meant in a sincere and objective way talking about when you’re in a political debate and someone says you’re wrong and that you should educate yourself there’s usually no correct answer in these situations so you can’t do it without finding a biased sauce",0,222,1351,115,0.017391304347826087
if your first language is english you have no excuse for not being able to distinguish between “there” “their” and “they’re”,the same goes for “your” vs “you’re” and also “two” “too” and “to” these words are so commonplace that getting them wrong is just lazy  feel like telling people politely when they’ve used them incorrectly is the right thing to do and saying “language is fluid” isn’t appropriate for such a serious mistake i think it’s fine to ignore minor mistakes with punctuation and spelling but using the wrong “there” actually changes the meaning of a sentence often to nonsense since the wrong word is being used  seen a weird trend of people proudly not knowing the difference between these words and it just feels like they’re patting themselves on the back for not understanding something that takes less than five minutes to learn it’s embarrassing and it honestly makes people look stupid,0,135,813,128,0.015625

thanking god for something a human clearly did is a massive insult to that person,im not sure if this is truly a massive unpopular opinion but ive seen enough posts and comments online ive had enough have nothing against religion you can believe whatever you want to believe in order to get through life and live your best one however critiquing others  no matter how positively  by thanking a being we have no concrete proof exists for the doing of someone else is just a massive insult and injustice seen so many posts and comments on nice posts about how for example god is amazing for helping those doctors save that little girl and for successfully giving her the surgery she needs i dont care how real you think he is god had nothing to do with that those men and women went to many years of medical school  where they learned from and were taught by other professionals not god  and paid many dollars to get to where they are god did not guide that persons hand skill knowledge training and their muscles did god did not come down from the heavens god did not pick up a scalpel and fix your child god did not do that surgery they did and saying that god did is a massive insult to that person because it negates everything theyve done in order to save someone it completely ignores the effort time money and passion they put into their career and life in order to save someone elses especially if that person is not religious you can call it a miracle or gods work if you had just enough milk for your cereal or finished both the shampoo and conditioner at the same exact time god didnt do that either for all of your previous actions did but whatever it doesnt really matter because nobody did anything monumental and praiseworthy there to say that god did something amazing like save a childs life take down a school shooter apprehend a thief found a missing person etc is just wrong its simply appalling and unfair and blatantly discredits the actual people who went through many tiring challenging immense processes to give someone something amazing youre giving the praise to a quite frankly fictional being rather than the physical ones that concretely and very obviously sacrificed so much for you its just wrong edit just to fix a word here and there as well as clarify i recognize that starting this off with i have nothing against religion may seem counterintuitive but i dont have anything against religion as a whole i have something against those who use religion to discredit others for their benefit ignore reality and praise someone who quite plainly didnt do the action that is getting praise its a simple matter of a lack of respect additionally i dont mean the common thank god phrase  thats perfectly fine what i mean is the active continuous thanking of god versus those people involved in something amazing such as only thanking god and not those involved or simply making god the main focus of the gratitude also i gotta be that person as i dont know how to find who did it and thank them personally thank you so much for my first ♪siiilver and gooold♪,0,546,3151,82,0.024390243902439025

woke people can be some of the most abusive people youll ever meet,"at least this has been my experience
 think its great when people take a stand for social issues and i have no issues with being awake however this can go too far and it allows for people to become abusive while thinking they are completely in the right thats an incredibly dangerous thing
 ex was one of these people she cared deeply about fixing social issues and because of that she felt it was fine to steamroll everyone she knew and cared about because their discomfort was worth the change she was pushing to an extent i even agree with that she was way too hypocritical though eventually she became dead to my feelings if she hurt me i did something to deserve it or i was overreacting out of fragility and needed to get a grip she was never willing to admit wrong and my views were always tainted because i was a guy
 spent way too long in that relationship hating myself because i respected her efforts for change it wasnt until i sought therapy that i realized how hurtful she was being eventually i came to the conclusion that believing the same things she did didnt give her a pass to treat people awfully so yeah sometimes the most outwardly caring and seemingly empathetic people can be the most abusive ones in your life
 theres nothing wrong with caring about or trying to fix social issues i hold values very similar to hers this isnt targeting beliefs saying they are wrong its targeting bad actions done thinking they are justified with good beliefs",0,266,1522,69,0.014492753623188406

most people have literally no clue what communism actually is,"i will start by saying that im not the expert either proving the point  using the united states as the basis for this argument since in my country portugal we have a communist party but their members and people in general actually understand what they believe in and what they want if they managed to become the governing party  its basically impossible at this moment and they have 78 or less every election  in the us i come to realize that people actually have no idea what communism or communist ideas are socialism isnt equal to communism also everything i disagree with isnt communism you are just an idiot that chooses to be ignorant or that doesnt want to hear no more often than none would even argue that most people cant even point if a political idea is mostly left or rightwing 1

 it seems to be important to clarify that my goal was never to promote communism as some great idea that is the best option for your country or something my only point was people talk about stuff and equate it to communism when there is actually no evidence of it being the case or it being even remotely close in terms of what both represent

adults who dont drink water because they dont like the taste of it are infantile and immature not everything needs to be exciting in order to be hydrated,im personally frustrated with people who cannot drink just a glass of water and need either soda or crystal light or something to make it more exciting water is great you need it i assumed this post would just die honestly because i thought it would be judged to be a popular opinion and based on the majority of comments it is generally a pretty popular opinion if not too strong of one for personally insulting people by calling them infantile and immature i stand by this modification if you have clean water and insist on drinking something else with a bunch of sugar all the time you are behaving immaturely and childishly if you do not have access to clean or drinkable water this absolutely doesnt apply i posted on an old throwaway not made for this post because it stemmed from a very recent conversation with a few people who know my main account and this old throwaway was also a water related aita i was judged to be ta which i ended up agreeing and seeing the other side so i thought that was a decent use of that old account please consider drinking more water and taking some of the suggestions within the comments for how to make it tastier without adding unnecessary sugars to it,0,220,1221,157,0.012738853503184714

gaming is a healthier medium for young adults than social media and youtube in terms of mental health,gaming has a bad reputation for being addictive and frowned upon by parents since their kids seem to always be gaming and not doing anything productive although gaming can be addictive and a time sink i argue that its still much better to have a society interested in gaming especially young adults than all obsessed with social media and youtube instead of course gamers also use social media and youtube but im talking about the hardcore users of these other mediums where they dont game and use that time to consume these other mediums more instead media young adults using social media is terrible for their mental health apps like instagram makes them feel like they need to show off fake affluence stuff or go on unnecessary trips to keep up with the joneses they need to document their life just because everyone else is and if they dont document it in a way that looks appealing to others  theyre afraid of being judged this is bullshit on the other hand if these people didnt put so much emphasis on social media and just games instead there is no stupid competition between friends since the gamer doesnt value dumb stuff like that as much theyre too involved with the games to be interested in petty and vapid competition between peers yes everyone watches youtube but nongamers who put more time into youtube i argue can be bad depending on the content they consume youtube has all sorts of content but a lot of the content is paid propaganda to influence people to believe their political agenda a lot of channels try to get kids to fall down an altright rabbit hole without them even realizing that its happening theyre just browsing videos on youtube to kill time then all of a sudden they have these rightwing beliefs that they probably wouldnt have if they didnt fall down a rabbit hole  channels are funded by organizations to spread influence about their political beliefs its not a fair balance google doesnt care as long as theyre getting paid if these impressionable young adults were just playing video games theyd stay away from the politics for the most part and disinformation out there they wouldnt be as vested into these channels and spend their focus on improving on games,0,388,2278,101,0.04950495049504951

working 40 hours a week to afford a quality of life youre satisfied with is a blessing not a curse,i often hear redditors and sometimes real actual people talk about how 40 hour work weeks are oppressive im not trying to challenge that but the reality is that you are lucky and blessed if you can afford to work only 40 hours a week i am speaking from the perspective of an american but i wouldnt be surprised if this applied to other countries as well vast majority of well paying careers expect you to work far more than 40 hours a week think of the traditionally aspirational whitecollar positions doctor lawyer various finance jobs engineer etc all these jobs are notorious for working 5060 hours a week and even more those sexy careers like game dev designer sportsentertainment agent more than 40 hours want to be your own boss and become a successful entrepreneurcontent creator great now you have no boundaries between work and your personal life and again youll probably be working more than 40 hours want to do the right thing and work for a nonprofit youll make far less than your peers and work more than 40 hours often fulltime positions that only require 40 hours of work are ones with an hourly wage and management that does not want to pay overtime often this is a red flag as it can lead to the expectation of accomplishing 10 hours of work in an 8 hour day most industries the prestigious and high paying positions are associated with larger workloads not less this includes those big silicon valley companies renown for their workplace benefits such as google not trying to say that its wrong or entitled to want to work 40 hours or less but unrealistic goals arent healthy a 40 hour work week that pays well is an aspirational goal that will require sacrifice to attain and is not something easily accomplished from the outset youll have to be smart about you career decisions and end up working a lot once youre in the position to take a job that provides better worklife balance while still paying the bills youll have to make a difficult choice between free time and incomecareer advancement i wanted to further emphasize that im not intending to cast judgement on anyone who doesnt wish to work 40 hours a week or more if it were up to me id hardly work at all im simply pointing to the fact that its rare and difficult to work 40 hours  a week or less and be able to afford the quality of life you want and that its not realistic to expect to work 40 hours a week or less when starting your career its not a choice for most people to have the choice is a privilege holy shit this blew up thanks i guess however i feel like there is a misunderstanding i want to clear up its possible to acknowledge all these things simultaneously 1 that its difficult to be able to work 40 hours a week or less and afford the quality of life one desires 2 that by it being hard to achieve for most people its a position of privilege and a good deal of luck a blessing and 3 this shouldnt be the case and establishes that there are many flaws that need to be addressed in our government economy and culture the basis of this unpopular opinion was the premise that a 40 hour workweek is terrible and avoidable while i argue that its a privileged position in our current economic reality for better or worse not sure if that makes this better or worse as this is runpopularopinion after all ,0,610,3493,101,0.009900990099009901

male friendships are very misunderstood by society and they’re much more valuable and healthy than they’re portrayed as,"as a dude i’ve seen a lot of people talk about male friendships as being “bullying competitions” “emotionally stunted” “toxic” etc i ask for their reasoning i get told that men trash talk each other so their friendships are based on insecurity that dudes don’t open up for their friends or support each other or that it’s just a giant dick swinging contest find this portrayal to be very unfortunate and a deep misunderstanding can’t speak for all men so please don’t tell me that i am i can only offer my perspective and what i’ve seen in other men trash talking isn’t meant to hurt we shit talk our boys because we know they’ve got our back and vice versa it’s done in the intent of poking fun of getting a good laugh and it shows the strength of our bond every single male friend group i’ve had there were boundaries that weren’t crossed if you trash talk your bro and he tells you seriously that he doesn’t appreciate it you stop and those who continue are usually told to quit it there guys who take it too far absolutely
are there guys who simply cannot enjoy it yup guys who can’t trash talk without being toxic should not represent all guys they’re obnoxious and not the majority
 for the “emotionally stunted” part again that’s a hilariously bad way of seeing it again not speaking for all men but a significant number of guys just don’t want to sit down and talk about how they feel all the time i have a serious issue or feeling and want to bring it up to my friend i will and he’ll listen 100 don’t open up all the time but that makes the times we do very significant and serious and we give full attention that guys don’t open up because of society isn’t the full picture we open up but selectively  our closest friend our dad our brother our uncle or father figure etc  friends don’t need to be aware of my emotional state at all times i love them to death and if they want to talk to me they can but we hang out to do activities with each other talk shit and forget about our problems and female friendships have different dynamics and that’s okay we should learn to accept these differences recognize the flaws inherent to each dynamic and make them better we shouldn’t label one dynamic as being inherently flawed just because it’s different than the other  would never trade the awesome bonds i’ve made for anything and i do not believe they’d be better without the trash talk or with more opening up  you see things the way you want to but saying this is the same as saying that female friendships are just gossip and drama at best an exaggeration and at worst a hollow echo of the truth i’m very happy this opinion is popular far too many guys are shamed into thinking their way of things isn’t the right one i needed to see this positivity  all fucking kings stay blessed",0,524,2982,121,0.008264462809917356
if your child asks for birth control for the love of god please give it to them,a pretty obvious opinion but rather unpopular where i’m from in the midwest i’m thankful that my mother told me that if i ever needed birth control she would get it to me that was 7 years ago when i was 13 now i’m 20 in a long term relationship and have been on birth control since 17 might not like some of the side effects i’ve seen acne bloating slight weight gain etc but at least i don’t have a child    of my two girl friends from high school were not allowed to be on any form of birth control one had to get it through college one didn’t have an option till post graduation  point is you are not going to prevent your kid from having sex by keeping birth control from them if you as a parent truly think that you are delusional teenagersyoung adults will always find a way to do what they want and their parents telling them ‘no’ is just going to make them want to do it more  this doesn’t just go for girls i’m only writing it this way because i am a girl and i know firsthand give your son condoms if he needs them and educate both your sons and daughters about being safe  took a nap and came back to all of this just wanted to point out a few things as i’ve been scrolling through the comments  yes i am well aware the female birth control does have long term side effects i’m also aware that it’s trial and error i’m on my 3rd type of birth control and i’ve never been happier it’s hard to discover what really works for you and that’s why it’s so important to see a doctor and not order pills online like they have available now  i’m well aware that female birth control doesn’t protect against stis but here’s the thing condoms don’t protect against babies either doubling up on both female birth control and condoms is a great way to prevent both a baby and stis  some are talking about fertility and birth control it is known that the birth control shot can increase your risk of infertility a bit more than most birth control but let’s think of other things that can affect fertility smoking extreme weight loss other types of hormones such as things we put in food endometriosis i could go on rape happens if you’re on birth control chances are you’re not going to get pregnant women can do whatever they want with their bodies  20 yo female living in ohio grew up catholic for all you saying religion is the answer this is definitely leaning more towards girls on the pill instead of boys with condoms if you are calling your female child a whore slut or anything of the sort there is something wrong with you women can have sex women can have sex how could i forget something so important birth control is used for so many other things 2 lol,0,517,2788,81,0.012345679012345678

we spend too much time discussing homosexuality when only 4 of the population is gay but meanwhile 80 of the population of the planet lives in poverty,i get human rights ending discrimination etc and i am 100 on board but the amount of time spent talking about something that affects so few people and the amount of posturing by the affected parties is insane  i agree its important but its nothing you need a parade for  there are waaaay bigger issues that get very little traction such as the number of people living in poverty even in the most developed nations  why is that  is it that the issues that affect huge percentages are too difficult to address  is it that no one in hollywood is poor but a disproportionate number are gay so there is no platform for poverty  is the feeling that poverty is a choice  why dont we have parades for teachers or people who are working to better the world for much larger percentages of the population  i know its been a long hard fight for basic human dignity for homosexual people  i dont debate that and i have tremendous respect for those people who suffered and continue to suffer for this cause not only respect but gratitude  the world as a whole is definitely better because of their sacrifices but still  added sources for the statistics i used as people seem to be going down that tangent maybe not the best sources but the first that popped up and seemed legit i appreciate the debate around whats defined as poverty i think its a good debate but even if you only count people who are literally starving its still twice as many people and that doesnt invalidate my initial statement have a nice day  this post was inspired by my personal perception that this issue which generally has no relevance to me seems to be in front of me where ever i go on the netmediamovies and honestly it seems completely disproportionate to the number of people actually affected so i stated my runpopularopinion there was some good debate and the usual amount of insanity but this post by  ushadovvvvalker makes a great point that i wanted to highlight    i stand behind the sentiment that i think we have bigger fish to fry but i deeply respect the position expressed by another redditor and i hope others will read it and appreciate it as well,0,400,2993,155,0.025806451612903226

telling people who have severe facial deformities that theyre beautiful is disingenuous patronizing dishonest and selfcongratulatory,theres a youtuber named nikki lilly who does music and makeup videos on youtube she looks like this you go to the comments section of any of her videos you see hundreds or thousands of comments that are telling her how beautiful she is there are rarely any other kind of comments as far as i can tell this kind of strikes me as similar to telling an overweight woman that she is skinny by no societal standards in the world that i can imagine would this girl be considered physically beautiful she has a condition that causes her to have a severe and grotesque deformity on half of her face she doesnt deserve to be bullied for this of course but i think the millions of fans she has and these thousands of comments are no coincidence i think her appearance is the reason for her popularity and so people view her as a freakshow just of a different kind people flock to her to her channel since they see her as a freakshow but they just leave patronizing comments telling her how beautiful she is so they and everyone who upvotes them can feel good about themselves see this as extremely strange behavior its almost as if nikki is some sort of moral well from which people can draw in order to feel good about themselves and others to have an unspoken massive communal backpatting party in the comments about how good they all are as people her videos have thousands or tens of thousands of comments people know the creator of the video will probably not see the comments however they do know that other people will thats why they leave these comments is a bizarre new kind of phenomenon and while im always happy for a fellow youtuber getting attention on their channel i dont think this is a good kind of attention i think its actually a very disingenuous and offputting kind of trend it leaves me feeling very dirty and confused about the nature of social media wouldnt be so bad if the comments were just normal mildly supportive or even constructive comments but these comments are really exaggerated all caps dozens of heart emojis lots of exclamation points its almost as if theyre trying to oneup each other for who can be the most overwhelmingly supportive and saccharine with their comments its actually kind of disgusting i dont even know if we have words for this kind of behavior since this is kind of a new phenomenon i just feel sorry for this girl i wonder if she understands whats going on there are a lot of people talking about the subjective quality of beauty in case its unclear im talking about the physical attractiveness of someones face which has a basis in science i understand that beauty as a poetic concept does indeed have a high degree of subjectivity but thats not what im talking about remember that nikki is primarily a makeupbeauty vlogger so comments about her being beautiful are likely referring to her appearance 2 this post is really blowing up so i wanted to share this video  posted by uthefarrquad which i think applies to this situation,0,539,3309,138,0.007246376811594203

as someone new to reddit i find this site a kind of disturbing highly politicized karmaaddicted selfdefeating hivemind,firstly i think this could be changed quite easily by simply doing away with updownvotes as someone new to this site it seems to me that these do nothing to encourage the free exchange of ideas and basically just exist to reinforce some kind of unwritten yet universally understood consensus criteria which is executed unconsciously by members and by which everything is judged seem to have a vague instinctual sense of what the hivemind wants and play up to it for purposes of generating the social currency of reddit which is karma sometimes they get it wrong or just resist it and in such cases they are instantly and viciously torn to shreds like an ant entering a stream of ants from a different colony  by other posters who apparently relish such opportunities to pay totem to the reddit hivemind god which validates this behavior and rewards their faith once again through the miracle of upvotes net result is a kind of vapid recycled echo chamber the froth and dregs but no middle the same ideas offered up like prayers in all manner of instances which may in some cases even be unique in their particularities but usually arent and never vary in theme forever a collective beast of emotion operating on some algorithm of demented utterly artificial and totally insincere pseudomorality which is either the petard upon which it has hoisted itself or otherwise serves as an excuse to spruik inconsequential meaningless drivel to the end of feeding its insane and profound addiction to a meaningless fiat karma do not think outside of a very select handful of subs it is good for anybody,0,276,1650,125,0.048
saying ‘teach boys not to rape’ is just as bad as ‘teach blacks not to steal’ or ‘teach muslims not to bomb’,i don’t understand why people think it is appropriate to aim antirape media and slogans at boys or men especially at university campuses and colleges where it is very common to separate the boys and the girls at the start of the year for workshops against sexual assault imagine if they separated the whites and the blacks and taught the whites how to avoid being robbed and taught the blacks the definition of theft or if they gave all the non muslims a ‘bomb whistle’ to blow when they think they are about to be bombed none of this is considered ok but still we see rape as a women’s issue rape is a societal issue regardless of who the direct victims are nobody wants rape and yet we treat men like they are rapists by default unless taught otherwise,0,140,763,110,0.03636363636363636
offending someone and then calling them fragile sensitive or triggered to shut them down etc is cheap manipulative and counterproductive,"it goes like this  1 makes an inflammatory statement that strongly challenges anothers views person 2 the target of the statement will take the bait and respond often in a defensive manner as they feel attacked they were that was the point of the initial statement person 1 elated with themselves smugly ridicules person 2 and calls them fragile to shut them down person 2 wants to respond but if they defend themselves person 1 will claim this is proof of their fragility if they dont reply person 1 will claim theyve won the argument is such a cheap way of scoring meaningless points nothing is gained here no meaningful discussion is had no views are changed if anything all that happens is person 2 ends up with a stronger negative attitude towards people who align themselves with person 1s views increasing polarisation  goal should be to win over people that hold opposing views with rational argument patience and understanding ridiculing doesnt work especially not online i personally feel like a large percentage of social media users needs to take a few deep breaths stop focusing on 1upping each other with meaningless toxic argument and focus on commonalities that bring us together rather than militantly pointing out differences that cause frustration and division wishful thinking lol
 for examples of this in action just browse the comments
 it appears in principle this view is quite popular but in practice i see the dismissive technique i described used all the time making it arguably popular which is why i posted here perhaps i should have used the word provoking instead of offending in the title agree with comments about claiming offence being used as a way to shut down meaningful discourse",0,291,1801,139,0.007194244604316547
society is hypersexualised and i feel scared for the kids growing up with it,let me start by saying that im 17 this is coming from a place of serious concern im not some boomer trying to rag on the new generation because i have nothing better to do is so unnecessarily sexualised these days adverts for the most banal products music random sex scenes in movies that could have been marketed to younger audiences without them you name it theres a naked girl or a weird moaning noise or an obvious innuendo its kind of sickening lot of people argue that its not oversexualisation its sexual liberation that this phenomenon is taking motion because people mostly women whose ability to do it has been hampered for centuries are feeling more comfortable in their bodies and with expressing their sexuality and thats great  we dont need it everywhere every second tweet coming across my timeline is someone oversharing on their sexual experiences for clout and every song and music video is geared towards some sort of sexual stimulationrelease everything is just constantly screaming sex sex sex heres where my concern comes in if the internet was made up solely of people who had a sharp grasp on reality and on themselves this onslaught of sexual content wouldnt be nearly as worrying as it is but thats not the case younger much more impressionable kids are using the internet nowadays and its bleeding into the content i see from them the biggest culprit as example tiktok what may seem to many of us as completely harmless because the constant wave of hypersexualised content has practically immunised us to its effects would terrify any mother and i couldnt say i would blame it kids doing sexual povs inappropriate dances and dressing the way that they do is all a cause of the fact that they see older people doing it normalising it and running with it there have been countless times that i have seen videos of boys standing shirtless in their rooms lipsynching to sexual lyrics and girls dancing incredibly explicitly and then i click on their page and see that theyre 13 14 15 or 16 is horrifying to me its basically a new wave of paedophile fodder and its the fault of societys hypersexualisation not here to pearl clutch and say that sexual expression should not be allowed or something of course not everybody should be able to do exactly what they want to do but we have to be extremely conscious of the people that are seeing our content however fleetingly and censor ourselves for their safety im also not here to say that wearing certain clothes somehow constitutes immediate sexual intentions from other people but you have to admit that nonces are more likely to go for children they see as easy and therefore vulnerable thats why im so fucking scared for them this is just an opinion looking forward to the society has always been sexual comments,0,488,2922,78,0.05128205128205128

a bad teacher has more negative influence upon society than a drug dealer,some people would say teachers are like your second parents children spend many many hours of the most important stages of their lives with teachers so without a doubt they have a huge impact on their growth if were comparing them individually one bad drug dealer can definitely hurt a single person much more than one bad teacher drug addiction is a pretty serious thing after all but take into consideration that drug dealers sell to a very small percentage of the population whereas teachers are going to impact much more people teaching hundreds if not thousands of students throughout their entire careers they can be the reason children end up resenting a certain subject they could have had a lot of potential in or worse resenting school entirely and maybe even dropping out and becoming a drug dealer bad teachers are a gateway drug themselves in some cases,0,149,895,73,0.0136986301369863
forcing children to change in front of each other for gym is sexually abusive and this is a hill i will die on,when i was in middle and high school one of the greatest sources of trauma i have ever endured was being forced to change in front of the other girls in locker rooms they would make fun of my body relentlessly throughout that entire time not only was i the nerdy kid but i basically had the body of a 11 year old until i was 16 and went through a major growth spurt where i went from completely flat chested to 32dd in the span of a single summer so my gym experience went from being made fun of for having a childs body to being accused of getting implants and further ridiculed the rest of my school life because it was solely my word against that of 8 other girls the administration did nothing to stop it even though the rumors spread like wildfire throughout the entire school its worth mentioning that i was extremely embarrassed by how fast my breasts grew so i wore extreme baggy shirts to try to hide them however those attempts to hide them were moot thanks to the locker room before gym worst incident crossed the line into full blown sexual assault four of the more popular girls circled around me and violently poked and squeezed my breasts to the point where it was incredibly painful and they hurt for several days it was some weird test to see if they were real or implants was molested by a male adult as a 7 year old child and to be completely honest the abuse i suffered from my peers that i just described was every bit as traumatizing as that in a way it was even worse because there was no escaping it at least when i told my parents about the abuse from the adult it was dealt with and i never had to see him again with the abuse from my peers i had to suffer for years  of you might argue that was an especially shitty crop of girls not every locker room experience is like that yeah but a the administration didnt believe me because it was my word against everyone elses so i had to go through this shit for six fucking years despite making literally 8 different complaints b quite frankly it shouldnt take a seriously traumatic scenario to justify the idea that children shouldnt have to strip in front of people unnecesarrily when theyre not comfortable c if you think locker rooms abuse is rare you are living under a rock i gotta say i genuinely dont see how anyone besides pedophiles getting off on it could stand by the idea that we should continue to systemically force children to strip in front of each other oh lawdy thanks for all the awards,0,469,2564,111,0.018018018018018018
taylor swift has a victim mentality she is not a role model she is a mean girl bully in disguise and everyone is falling for it,update on the situation if you care this article says that big machine had to shut down their office yesterday because taylor fans were sending death threats the article also quotes a label exec saying  taylor can 100 percent perform all of her catalog past and present at the amas big machine has no issue with her performance going out on live broadcast because it recognizes it doesn’t have the right to block her labels can’t block any artists from performing any songs live take it however you will lots of cool and differing opinions in here and i’ve enjoyed reading them thanks for participating you guys 💕 post below here a feeling this is going to be an unpopular post because regarding the recent news about taylors record label dispute reddit has been overwhelmingly in support of her swift is always playing the victim almost all of her songs are about how some boy came along and broke her heart and how tragic that is because she was a perfect angel girlfriend and he was the absolute devil she put joe jonas on blast over their breakup told everyone on ellen that he broke up with her in a 20 second phone call but joe jonas came out and said that the only reason the phone call was so short was because she hung up on him but she was only 19 with this happened surely shes grown and changed as a person since then im not gonna link sources because you can find them easily on google but she continues to have relationships like this they end bitterly and she writes a song or makes a snarky public comment about how awful her ex is examples  john mayer calvin harris harry styles jake gyllenhaal at her feuds with other celebrities kanye and katy perry are kind of insane but shes fought with many others rihanna miley cyrus tina fey amy poehler the list goes on at how she defends herself in all of these situations she has literally told lies ex the kanye west debate and the joe jonas thing to paint a better portrait of her as the victim didnt she lie about her masters situation when the news first broke too didnt it come out that taylor did know about the deal and did have the opportunity to buy her masters but she passed it up it seems she had the power to stop this from ever happening in the first place shes posting some pretty big accusations of him publicly but she has nothing to back up her claims she is literally asking her fans to brigade someone and have blind faith that what shes saying about him is completely true definitely could be true and i do feel bad for her if thats the case shes a 30 year old grown ass woman worth half a billion dollars she could afford the best attorneys in the world to take this guy down but she decides to vent on twitter and ask her teenage fans to attack someone based on her word alone which has historically been unreliable i get that people think this is an important message to spread but the way she worded it sure seemed like it wasnt about spreading awareness so much as it was about getting revenge swift reminds me of a high schooler her squad is a clique and she is their regina george she has a pattern of unstable relationships and an inability to see her own flaws in them seems to think everyone else is the problem nah taylor youre the problem the common factor in all these situations is you and her music sucks,0,620,3749,132,0.022727272727272728

being proud of your race is lame because you had no choice of which race you are,people should be proud of their individual accomplishments instead of whatever they got at birth my first assumption when someone is proud of their race is that they haven’t done anything with their life so they have to latch onto the success of other people who look like them a couple of comments have suggested that this means you also shouldn’t be proud of your family that doesn’t apply because you had a direct impact on your family as they did with you this extends to your community what i am speaking of is hundreds of generations before you  point i’d like to make is if you agree that people shouldn’t be ashamed of what their ancestors did then by symmetry they shouldn’t be proud either current mongols don’t need to feel ashamed of ghengis khan i don’t think modern germans should be held responsible for hitler that also means they shouldn’t get credit for the great things their ancestors have done either because there is some confusion i’m not white i actually made this post with white nationalism and stefan molyneux in mind this logic should still apply to any race gene or whatever pre birth lottery you wonlost,0,201,1173,81,0.012345679012345678

if your boyfriendhusband is uncomfortable with a certain guy friend because he “knows their intentions” 90 of the chance he’s right,now this isn’t saying that every time your boyfriend see’s another guy talking to you he has the right to be upset this isn’t condoning abusive and controlling relationships by a long mark there are certain situations where the other guy could be a longtime friend or be with another person or just have no interest in that sense and it doesn’t mean that being overly jealous is a healthy behavior what it is about is if a guy suddenly comes into the girls life and is very flirty always demeans the boyfriend on the littlest things in hopes to cause a fight and is overly nice and affectionate to the point it’s weird and if it’s at that point that “friend” is not trying to just be friends there’s a difference between “hey i hope you’re having a good day” and “hey cutie how’s it going you wanna hangout at my place” most guys think alike and we can see when a guy is obviously trying to shoot his shot if you’re letting someone talk to you like that and just let them proceed while your significant other has stated they don’t feel comfortable with they talk to you you’re the one causing the problem and being toxic just respect your significant others feelings and emotions by understanding their point of view and tell that person they can’t flirt with you like that my ex always had guy friends acting like this and she always insisted they didn’t like her that way and unsurprisingly the week we broke up they all confessed their feelings for her and that they’ve liked her all along as much as it sucks to say many guys are vultures at the chance of getting laid when the opportunity arises,0,295,1617,134,0.007462686567164179

i wish there were more movies where the protagonists lost,"i love watching movies especially with friends we go out and enjoy new movies and talk about stuff and just overall have a great time but over the last few years i have been thinking about what movies were the most memorable to me  spoilers ahead some of the movies i found most memorable are movies like no country for old men avengers infinity war se7en fight club hannibal etc etc these movies are all super memorable to me not only because theyre good movies but because they break free from the trend of invincible protags that you know are going to win in the end now movies where the hero wins are not inherently bad or anything i just feel like a lot of them lose at least a small bit of their tension because of it when i watch an action thriller i want to really worry for the heroes i want to be attached to them and sit at the edge of my seat because im not really sure if they will actually make it out alive

 i find myself getting invested much much more often when uncertainty is part of the movie i want to worry i want my heart to race i want to cry i want to get mad i believe that if a movie is capable of making you feel true emotion it succeeded in what it set out to do if you cry at the end of a movie you were most certainly invested in the story and right now i feel like many studios are just too afraid to break the mold in that way i can understand i mean money is on the line and lots of it at that it is definitely a gamble to try to ignore the standard movie structure because many people are so used to it that if a movie doesnt follow that structure it can feel off or confusing to the viewers but those movies that do successfully break free of it are often very very memorable because of it movies that break the mold and try something unique adds uncertainty to the movie that uncertainty causes the viewer to become invested in the movie as they never truly know what could happen in the end if you think the protagonist truly could die or lose you feel the same emotions they do and if a movie is able to get you to feel emotion it definitely succeeded in my opinion",0,418,2161,58,0.017241379310344827

its funny how most of you guys assumed that you have to adopt a kid from african countries im not pro lets adopt and help the third world
im pro cant feed em dont breed em 
but if you have money to raise a child try adopting one itll make you happy and youll be giving a child probably a new beautiful life someone said the adoption cost is 30000 like wtf
your country needs to figure out some shit for that man this cost is an average cost to raise a child for 10 years fulfilling his basic needs and school fees in my country man  2 getting a tons messages from the  people who were adopted

people who think animals are gods and humans suck are cringy,every time i see a post with a dog or any animal really you always see the comment with a couple thousand upvotes saying how much animals are great and humans ruin the earth or some bs i think people who treat animals like gods are just people with no social skills and blame others for hating them so they resort to things who cant talk and love you just because you feed them,0,74,379,61,0.01639344262295082

the most underrepresentedoppressed group in america isnt blackhispanicgaysbietc its native americans,"its so true that history is written by the winners if germany was won by hitler they would treat holocaust exactly the same as how people treat native american killing now

 it bugs me the fuck out that just because americans are seen as good people in todays society we dont treat native american killing at the same level as holocaust when it should be  you see media whine about asylum for immagrants what about killing and kicking off native americans and confining them in reserves because americans were fucking shitting themselves for more land  say japanese are adamant about not apologizing for what happened in wwii what about americans to native americans say there arent many female millonairesleaders what about native americans say there are lack of black lead movies what about native americans say slavery was bad they admit it because black people have voice in todays society what about massive genocide native americans went through you didnt even have a chance to work you just fucking died feel like native america  genocide is getting wayyyyyyyyyy to less of an aknowledgement for what happened and its because noone cares to represent the native americans

climate change needs to stop being a political thing it’s a scientific reality that needs to be taken seriously and politics just get in the way of us fixing it,can we all just accept the fact that climate change is real it’s not about which political side you are on it’s about the real scientific data that shows it is real and is currently affecting us look at the extreme weather stories lately from the huge fires in california and australia  or the massive typhoon that just went through the philippines you don’t have to be left or right to see it it’s a huge problem that needs to be fixed by all of us as many people have pointed out i guess i should have put partisan thing instead of political thing politics are needed to decide further steps into climate change it’s just that there are strong opinions holding us back from that now i apologize for any confusions and thank everyone for pointing this out the thread of comments below has turned into a shitstorm of political debates which is exactly what my post is saying needs to stop happening if you are going to go down there and argue your opinion i first ask you to please not this was supposed to be an unpopular opinion not a political battle but if you are going down there to fight good luck soldier may the power of the earth be with you ,0,218,1191,163,0.018404907975460124
society should run in shifts so that people who are naturally night owls can go about their lives comfortably not just the morning people this would actually benefit the world in several ways,i’ve read that in early huntergatherer civilizations people would work  sleep in shifts some were awake during the day some at night and some in between this was to ensure the safety of the group and likely to maximize productivity as well this seems to be why humans have evolved to be either “morning larks” or “night owls”  these traits still exist in humans our societies should reflect this many people i know are total night owls and find it very difficult to get out of bed  function at the hours that society demands yet they are full of creativity energy  drive at night firing on all cylinders  getting some fantastic work done i believe that if society were to operate in shifts many of these types of people would choose to work at night  sleep in during the day there are some jobs that offer night shifts but there are not many and there are basically no options for diningshoppingactivitiesetc late at night  this system was put into place of course it wouldn’t be binding you would be allowed to switch between working during the day or during the night or somewhere in between you’d just have to work it out with your employer i believe this would also lower the crime rate as those who choose to commit crimes in the nearly empty  quiet streets of nighttime would find it a lot harder to go unnoticed  considered the potential costs of businesses staying open 247 and while i haven’t really calculated the specifics on this one yet someone smarter than me can chime in on this in the comments i think it could work not every business would be obligated to stay open 247 but i believe that employers will be able to find many nightinclined people who would choose to work odd hours if given the option over waking up at the ass crack of dawn there could be “day divisions” and “night divisions” of companies which would be able to work parallel to each other  collaborate through meetings at inbetween times that can work for all  are other interpersonal factors that i haven’t quite worked out what if a day person falls in love with a night person what about schools should they offer this option too what would this do to families because honestly this is just a hypothetical system i thought of while moaning about how i really really don’t want to wake up early tomorrow but i do see many potential benefits if all the details are ironed out correctly again if anyone smarter than me is reading this and wants to give their take on this system’s economicinterpersonalpolitical impacts i’d love to hear it the nighttime world wouldn’t be quite as active as the daytime one but it would be a lot more active than it is now and maybe through giving people the chance to work  live in a way that is best suited for their individual biology societies will be able to increase productivity as well as overall quality of life thank you all for these awards especially my first platinum didn’t expect this post to gain this much traction or support happy to see it’s resonating with y’all your support is definitely making this early morning easier for my night owl heart ,0,566,3198,194,0.010309278350515464
hard tacos actually suck and are the inferior taco delivery device,"i just got 3 hard tacos instead of the soft that i ordered and i’m not driving back to fix it but i am increasingly bothered by each bite why do people choose this for themselves about it plebs  average human can fit a full hard taco shell into their mouths which mean close to half the bites are just chips and toppings not to mention that’s only if you get at least halfway through the taco without it crumbling into a sad mexican shame salad in the wrapper am i supposed to funnel into my mouth like a freaking savage or do i get up off the couchwhich i was too lazy to leave to get the dang tacos in the first place to get a bowl or plate to hold  so i can eat it like nachos without embarrassing myself or spilling it at least with a soft taco i have a chance to get an equal amount of fillings in one bite  
just why 

 why some things to mention
1 i see you haters saying it’s not an unpopular opinion but i read you and you’re wrong
2 as much as i would love to hand form a hard tortilla wrap it in a soft taco toast the shells in the oven or otherwise doctor this taco i’m exhausted as hell and that’s why i ordered freaking taco bell in the first place don’t gutter palette shame me guys a bitch is tired and nothing good is close or open it’s unreal the amount of people that think i’m just a messy eater if i was a messy eater then the fact that the tacos make a mess wouldn’t bother me instead it’s really hard to eat messy food holding a baby which is how i eat 90 of my meals",0,306,1558,67,0.014925373134328358

people should remake bad movies instead of good ones,"some movies are really bad but have genius premises unfortunately those premises have been wasted since the movie turned out to be boring and everyone forgot about it   
an example i recently thought of was vanishing on seventh street a movie that i think has a genius premise you die unless you are in light areas and days get shorter until all light vanishes but the plot turned out to be really average horror stuff   
there are other bad movies with great premises it would make much more sense to remake them but hire better writers and directors   
the good ones already have used all their potential and no one really needs a new version of them its mostly just milking what already worked instead of doing something original",0,135,746,52,0.019230769230769232
children dont owe their parents anything for being raised by them,a lot of people ive talked to think that they are owed by their children for raising them most folks dont even raise their children well yet they expect the children to pay them back for all the trouble they had with them for pitys sake it was your choice to have children if you consider that choice as an investment into your future just dont have children because you are obviously a trashbag of a person for thinking that way and even if the child was an accident its not their goddamn mistake its yours there is a ton of things you can do to prevent it even an abortion is a 100 times better solution than raising someone just to make them feel miserable,0,126,683,67,0.014925373134328358
americans vastly underestimate the number of actors who take steroids for roles and youtube fitness culture is lying through its teeth,you can get an amazing body naturally but you cant do it in 6 months these actors going on talk shows saying they gained 25 pounds in 5 months by eating chicken rice and broccoli sets unbelievably unrealistic expectations people hear this and think they can do it too and when they gain about 6 pounds of muscle in 5 months they get discouraged and give up the open secret of steroid use in the film industry is turning people away from fitness and setting unachievable standards there seem to be a lot of comments stating this is possible with personal chefs and trainers it isn’t this is the lie hollywood has decided to offer up to the public about why they can’t get their results they can’t exactly say they took steroids can they maximizing muscle growth takes a lot less than you might think about an hour a day of focused lifting and eating in a slight surplus they feed us this lie though because most of us can’t afford trainers and chefs so it’s somewhat believable 2 there’s some people commenting on here about how they know someone or they personally have gained this much muscle in this time frame no you haven’t getting shredded and gaining lean muscle tissue are very different things it’s definitely possible to lose lots of weight in a short time 3 guys thank you so much for my first gold definitely did not expect this post to blow up like it did love you all 3,0,255,1426,135,0.007407407407407408
making somebody pay the ambulance feeshospital bills when somebody calls in a 5150 on them suicide attempt in which they have no say in weather or not they’re taken away is the most fucked up twisted bullshit i can imagine," no i do not want to commit suicide this is something that happened 4 years ago and has happened to several other people i know as well i simply hate it edit a lot of people keep saying this isn’t an unpopular opinion that’s genuinely baffling to me almost everyone in my life has said it’s the price somebody should have to pay for trying to take away their own life kind of with this “you made the mess now clean it up” attitude 
 is so willing to die they are genuinely  that miserable and psychologically tormented in their lives that they will attempt to harm themselves to the point that it will kill them and not only do they have to stay alive and spend 3 days locked in a ward with other people with varying degrees of mental illness some get violent they have to fucking pay for it this person has to pay these absolutely insane medical bills on top of continuing to pay to support themselves a person who didn’t even want to be alive that’s disgusting to me that’s so fucking disgusting after finally telling themselves “my life isn’t worth living i’m in agony i can’t take this anymore” saying their final goodbye to the world they now have to wake up in a hospital to find that their attempt failed and they have to continue living in agony stay there against their will for hours told they’re going to be sent to the psychiatric ward have a police officer sitting at their bedside get sent to this absolutely atrocious little box of a ward with people who are screaming backing them into corners and trying to hit them stay there for 3 fucking days only to find when they get home that they’re being billed 10000 for the ambulance ride alone yeah that’s a great way to make somebody not want to kill themselves put them through hell and stick them with a huge bill that makes them feel even more like they’re stuck in a massive pit that garbage doesn’t stop people from killing themselves it makes them look for other ways to do it later where they won’t get caught the experience in and of itself makes you worlds more suicidal than you’ve ever been in your life",0,389,2156,227,0.013215859030837005
shai jackson is the perfect example of why racism isn’t getting solved in the united states,"for those who don’t know she went after a 13 year old for saying “guacamole nga penis” and doxxed him and his family leading to his apparent expulsion from school and his parents getting fired  apparently the expulsion and firings were just rumors and aren’t true which is good and she doxxed the wrong person too sorry for the misinformation there
 is why racism isn’t getting solved people keep on doing meaningless things that end up harming others instead of actually changing the system protesting the racism of the us will change things going after people for something they said that means nothing isn’t doing anything at all stop acting like you’re saving the world by attacking people for joking around it is ridiculous and gets us nowhere",0,129,774,91,0.04395604395604396

plain solid colored shirts are superior to any sort of branded or graphic shirts,a plain solid colored shirt is aesthetically pleasing it makes you look clean and nice and usually you can find them made well some logos can pass if they aren’t too out there but most of the time a shirt looks a lot worse when branded or with a graphic design in my opinion a solid color looks so much better on any person than some of the ridiculous looking brandedgraphic design shirts people find to wear the only good exception is collegiate wear if you are offended by the fact i used the word superior go dry your tears with your inferior shirts,0,104,567,81,0.012345679012345678

if you lived 100 years ago you would be just as racist as everybody else,"a lot of people like to say that they could never racist if they lived 100 years ago and that is almost certainly not true the vast majority of people are products of their environments and they might be completely different people if they were born somewhere else people are shaped by their environment in so many different ways at a such an early age that if the prevailing thought is that minorities are intellectually inferior you would probably go right along with it without even questioning it because thats how people used to be 
      im not at all saying that any of this acceptable behavior but a lot of the reasons why people thought this was because really thats just how it was there are obviously exceptions for people who really went against the norm and didnt think these things but these people were a minority most people causally thought these things and you would too if you grew up in the 1800s im really sick of people saying that they couldnt because thats just their 21st century mindset working but if you lived 100 years ago you would be just like everyone else perhaps some of my points are being overlooked so ill try to be more clear obviously if youre not white then this does not apply to you as much if youre black and born in 1820 you arent really in the same boat poor choice of words i know than a white male i am not condoning the behavior of the people who lived then and had their own way of thinking racism and other forms of intolerance are not acceptable my point is that i might have thought just like them if i was white and living 100 years ago  yes i am american and most of my knowledge and my post stems from that non americans of reddit if things apply to you differently then it may be true but i cannot argue upon something in which i have no legs upon  to all those who have given examples as to how they broke away from the social norms of their homes maybe you are the few exceptions but at the same time there are a myriad of other people who are unable to be as open minded as you were especially those who lived centuries in the past",0,404,2141,74,0.013513513513513514

it’s totally okay to change your opinion on something it doesn’t make you a hypocrite it shows growth,people will hold your opinions you had earlier in life against you and if you change your mind you are a hypocrite  something against someone that they believed in 5 10 20 years ago is ridiculous  should be encouraging growth and healthy change in people if you were a shitty person and you decide you want to turn your life around or change your mind this should be celebratednot condemned  this doesn’t apply to everything but most things ie if you’re a murderer i feel that you can change your lifestyle and the way you think but you must always be held accountable for what you have done this blew up a lot more than i expected it to for context i have just seen a lot of people in my hometown changing their opinions about the current state of the world with covid19 and many people i know are getting berated for what they said about the pandemic before it came to the us and changing their mind now that they are being affected by it to a greater degree i live in the south where the term “hypocrite” is thrown around pretty regularly 2 fucking hell i understand a ton of you agree with me and a lot of you don’t think this is an unpopular opinion i was posting this not in context of reddit’s echo chamber of opinions but based on the opinions of people outside our corner of the internet who i’ve been dealing with on social media for the past two weeks people will never forget and hold shit against you until the day you die,0,275,1497,104,0.028846153846153848

i believe we have officially reached a point where no news source is truly credible meaning that nobodys views hold any value or relevance,in many ways i think this was an inevitable conclusion of the internet and progression of technology it is now impossible for the average person to know the truth about anything as deepfake style videos continue to become more and more believable i think we are quickly approach  or may have already arrived  to a point in which nothing you believe about anything holds any sort of validity evidence is becoming increasingly dubious it is incredibly easy for different news sources to spin up competing narratives on political or social events and there is really no way for an average person to discern a difference essence this will have set us back by 500 years no longer can you trust anything you read hear or even witness video footage of now unless you see things happen with your own eyes your entire reality can be shaped by a handful of new organizations honestly pretty scary to think about,0,160,949,140,0.007142857142857143

vanilla coke is the best flavor even better than the regular flavor of coke,to begin what the hell even is the flavor of regular coke sugar its indiscernible and frankly a little bland all you really get with the base flavor is fizz  the vanilla flavor however the whole soda gets creamier smoother with a flavor you can notice and a sweet aftertaste reminiscent of buttercream frosting the whole drink gets less harsh to swallow not to mention that vanilla and whatever the base flavor is work like really well fact they work together so well that the combination could be its own soda because it has its own taste unlike cherry or orange coke which just taste like regular coke with fruits shoved in them   only real downfall to vanilla coke is that its not widespread only two stores in my town sell it which is a huge shame considering how much of a blessing vanilla coke is  you all for coming to my tedtalk now go buy some vanilla coke,0,163,924,77,0.03896103896103896

a bad teacher has a worse influence on society than a drug dealer,a bad teacher can make hundreds of people hate a subject or even school for their whole life this means while an average drug dealer has bad influence on society and on their clients if we compare individually one teacher and one drug dealer its debatable if having a bad influence on the education and professional life of hundreds of children is worse or not than selling drugs to a smaller fraction of the people i think it is a child giving up school while young because of a teacher is way more likely to die young or to go to jail or even to become a drug dealer which is quite ironic here because if a bad teacher caused only one dealer he has had a worse influence than a dealer for those of you who will say that drug dealers actually kill people when teachers dont a lot of people turn to drugs excluding medicinal in indirect consequence of quitting school which is not to blame only on teachers but they should take a part of the blame and a huge one in some cases i am not defending drug dealing i am just comparing it to teachers i appreciate so much the work that passionate teachers make and the incredibly positive impact theyve had on my life and the ones of billions of people this post is about bad teachers but i have to make it clear good teachers exist too,0,244,1331,65,0.015384615384615385

the american style of tipping is a toxic culture that should be abolished,"now before i continue i would like to say that i aint american but i have read about how tipping works there from reddit thus according to internet law im an expert on the matter in all seriousness though just correct me if im wrong first of all you guys say that tipping is necessary in order for workers to earn above minimum wage however isnt it a rule in most establishments that if the employee doesnt make enough through tips their boss should cover the rest what do you know apparently untipped waiters arent suffering from lack of cash you might say that if tipping is abolished the cost of food in restaurants will rise so what you are already paying extra through your bloody tips just divert that cash to a higher price of a meal just make things a bit more simple  apparently there is also cases of employers stealing their workers tips or forcing them to share it like how certain restaurants force their waiters to equally share their hard earned tips with their fellow workers what the fuck is that so if i work hard treat my client extra super special awesome and received a glorious 50 percent tip for my hard work i must share it with lazy harry who sleeps in the storeroom every chance he get and dont tell me that waiters have to share their tips with the cooks for the sake of fairness after all dont cooks earn above the min wage  unlike most people apparently i love maths damn how i loved it and i was pretty good at it nevertheless it doesnt mean that i want to do a freaking mental calculation everytime i finish a meal like wtf people i wanna chill after i finish dinner and dont you people start giving me pointers on simple ways to calculate how much to tip a person i find it twisted that tipping is so ingrained in american culture that you guys make a literal rule for it japanese student bow to their teachers respectfully before starting class but any american asshole who gives below 20 for a tip is the scum of the earth and is a reserved a special vip room in hell  plus tipping culture apparently breeds a sense of entitlement among some in the service industry ive read stories about waiters and waitresses who turn their nose away from what they presume is a low tip and even subtly hint that they should get a higher amount like bitch you are literally getting money from someone whom isnt entitled to pay you squat and you got the audacity to be choosy about it  why only waiters get to be tipped why not the janitors the maids or the garbage men some of them have even tougher jobs then waiters they dont get tipped i mean when have you guys even said thank you to the guys who scrubbed your toilet bowl squeaky clean not to mention how some waiter may be lucky enough to earn double or triple above the minimum wage if they work at a particularly affluent restaurant a bit unfair isnt it i feel like the easiest way to solve this problem is for the american legislation to get amended so that the workers in the service industry get paid according to the minimum wage so why are you all so stupid that you cant figure out this simple solution  now im not saying that tipping is bad however it should be used to show appreciation rather than being something mandatory hell some restaurants even include tipping in the bill as a gratuitous fee how presumptuous is that crap im straying of point anyway like i was saying tipping should be a choice on the customers behalf to pay for some particularly outstanding service from their waiter it shouldnt be freaking corrupted by being made socially compulsory 
 guys might be wondering why the hell i decided to post this i dont live in america nor do i plan to this has nothing to do with me whatsoever so why am i being a busybody well its because this annoys me its really really annoying on how this whole issue is so stupid and unnecessarily overcomplicated of course this aint the only time america decided to be different in order to separate themselves from the rest of the world only to end up looking like idiots remember the imperial system crap similarly this whole issue is such a big pain in the ass for everybody that i internally cringe everytime i think about so i decided to vent about it by bashing the americans thats all





 1 most of you talk about how tipping is a good thing because servers get more money than if they totally depend on min wage that working as a server is so horrible that nobody will do it if not for the tips well guess what there are other shitty jobs out there and they dont get tipped for it so this seems pretty unfair to me basically servers want this culture to stay despite they getting less than minimum because its better for them compared to the customers 2 whats up with europe and shitty service you guys keep talking about how tipping incentives servers in america and you use your experience with europe to prove that this is not a thing in southeast asia where i actually live cuz people provide good service here without expecting tips you westerners are seriously dissapointing me here 3 my god you servers are salty af clinging to your precious tips just because you want to enjoy a lavish lifestyle that other minimum wage workers dont enjoy you guys are a bunch of whiny entitled crybabies 4 one thing i feel like i have to remind you guys is that im not hating on tipping instead i feel that we should only tip when we get great service not average service unfortunately though its purely voluntary americans are socially pressured to tip even for shitty service this is what i dislike",0,1028,5755,73,0.0273972602739726
whether 18 or 40 women who have sexual relationships with 13 year olds need to be immediately hunted down by the law and put in 20 years prison just like when its men doing the same thing," double standard makes it okay for women to commit to this kind of behavior and we dont punish them equally were building two different social classes into the law why does anyone think its just different for an older woman to have sex with a male compared for an older man

 a youtube video of snl making a joke about male students with female teachers for instance actually reasons for making a valid reverse argument based on human development mature at 10 and boys have to wait til 20 for some things google brain data reach maximum adult height at 1315 boys gets a 1418 period to reach it again showing that females mature sooner than males  are superior at emotional intelligence to boys and ei is defined as the ability to read and understand others their emotions their thoughts their intentions etc google again it would seem obvious theyd know more rather than less because of all these verifiable facts a 13 year old boy and 18 year old girl is leagues apart compared to a 13 year old girl and 18 year old boy which would still be sick and disgusting since this case deals with the reverse and since people are praising him and her it shows the double standard and unpopularity it would be unanimous for an older male adult with a young girl to be considered a disgusting pedophile rapist but on this one people equivocate because the roles are reversed 

 the double standard throws childmales to the predatory womenwolves is acceptable the double standard simply makes it sickening and worse especially in light of the fact that it is males who are underdeveloped for that age period if there were a progressive victim stack males should be ahead of females on the list because of the developmental delay jfc this blew up

if your first thought after seeing a man being playful and nice to his own daughter or a kid are that the man must be creep you are a horrible person and a misandrist,read the edit i am not targeting the woman specifically i am saying that this line of thought should be considered as misandry and not just ‘i was raised by the society to have this bias’ kind of thing holy crap so much splaining to a person expressing an issue that affects men no wonder men don’t feel like expressing themselves a post on reddit in which a woman became suspicious when she saw a man playing with his daughter at a park she immediately thought of the man as a creep and a predator and she then blamed the society for her thinking yeah like that was the first time she saw a father and daughter together to realise sexist viewsthis is like saying people of certain colour or religion are criminals because all media has shown me about them is crime this thinking is obviously considered and is very racist one in their right mind ever thinks about creepy stuff as a first thought when they see a man playing with his own daughter unless they have been living in a hive mind or constantly staying in groups where men are always called predators misogynists and bad human beings  no one pointed out the misandry in such thinking and she never mentioned how she will improve upon her misandrist thinking and why it was bad instead of actually saying that thinking like this is bad and sexist she only says it’s what society does to you this helps to  a subtle line of thought among people that it’s ok to think like this and it’s normal because ‘society made you do this’ misandry needs to be pointed out more this was a great example of how hive minds and group think can lead to biases in humans and how social media promotes them yes i have read the post that i have used as an example and i have corrected one sentence which i have clearly misinterpreted and i was wrong i know in the post she mentions her thoughts were ‘biased’even after knowing the girl was the mans daughter btw that is the whole point of my post to point out that this immediate thinking that men being near kids even their own as creepy is not just a societal bias it’s misandrist and blaming society for this thought process even after being a grown up and having your own kids is horrible and affects men clearly seen from the experiences shared in this post my post is not meant to target the person it’s targeted at the thought i want people to start taking this negative stereotype created by hive minds about men as misandrist and wrong the thought when applied to all men is sexist and propagating the idea makes you horrible,0,469,2593,167,0.005988023952095809

math is actually really interesting,i expect this to be not well received as it is an actual unpopular opinion but math is actually extremely satisfying to do and learn about in a world full of chaos where everything you do affects your life and everything can change in a moments notice such as a car crash cancer job raise job loss kicked in the balls by random stranger 11 will always equal 2 45 degrees will always be half of 90 which will be half of 180 which will then be half of 360 making it a full circle which is the center of the fibonacci sequence which can be found in so many every day occurrences it is absolutely ridiculous in a world of chaos math is supreme calculations will never change sure maybe the us education system absolutely fucks over everyones perception of math by making it insufferable but what the teachers told us countless times is true math is in every day life and you may be using ymxb without even knowing it one day maybe forcing us to learn advanced mathematics is what makes our perception of it so twisted as does handing out sheets with 50 algebraic equations to solve at the start of class as a warmup for a new lesson when you just covered the subject of the 50 youre solving the day before math is extremely exciting solving a complicated geometric problem and being able to confidently circle the right answer on a test is the absolute best feeling in the words of jaime escalante of stand and deliver math is the great equalizer wow my first post to surpass 10 upvotes thank you all for the upvotes and awards,0,284,1571,35,0.02857142857142857

children under the age of 13 should not be allowed on social media or have their own device,"devices up i didnt have my own phone or tablet til i could pay for it with my own money i got a job as a dishwasher when i was 14 and paid for my first phone and it felt great now i take a look around me and take a look at my family and see that a lot of children have their own devices my younger sister recently got my moms old phone and my younger brothers use my dads ipad constantly i understand times are changing and a new generation is growing but i still dont think kids should be allowed to have their own devices til they can responsibly pay for it or take care of it the devices they use are constantly needing to be cleaned and in bad condition personally when i have kids of my own they wont be on mobile devices til they are at least 10 media media can ruin the idea of growing up in a split second youtube instagram facebook etc can all have a positive impact on young minds teaching them things and all that but it will mostly be negative if they use it they will get addicted and want to watch youtube all day and one wrong search can lead to uncomfortable conversations and things they shouldnt know until they are older my younger brothers and cousins are watching youtube constantly and the stuff they watch is extremely weird and in some cases scary i worry that its taking away from their child hood and just mind numbing them
thanks for reading if you got this far i have seen a lot of people who got a device at a younger age around ages nine through eleven for communication with their parents i do not have an issue with this however it is when a parent just gives their child a device wether it be a mobile phone or tablet that is fully paid for is when i start to disagree with the parents decision",0,338,1785,92,0.010869565217391304
the dating world would be better if culture supported women asking men out more than men asking out women,the reason for this is that women are more selective about it whenever there is a group of people deciding what to do its more efficient to have the most picky person decide since their choice is most likely to be accepted by the other members otherwise everyone else has to work to find something the picky person will accept and thats excess work thats exactly what happens in the dating world women are more picky but rather than take in upon themselves to decide who they want to date and act upon it they more often expect the men to come to them creating more work overall use numbers to illustrate lets say hypothetically that a man will agree to date 20 of women and women will agree to date 10 of men this case if a woman is looking to date we would expect a match after she asks out 5 men she approves of instead she makes the men do all the work we would expect a match after 10 men ask her out a hybrid is more efficient than this if the woman asks out 2 men 6 men asking her out in addition are then required for there to be an expected match thats 8 attempts which is less than 10 in a world where women are more selective allocating the work to men just complicates the process since women are the ones who have a narrower selection of potential mates let them decide who they want since they have a worse chance of being turned down,0,262,1431,106,0.009433962264150943

the vast majority of people are only supportive about your mental illness until you exhibit symptoms,this is so common and i never see anyone talk about it people love to claim that they will support friends and family members through their mental illness but as soon as they exhibit a symptom it’s blaming and abandonment here’s an example i’ve seen your parent claims to be supportive when you get diagnosed with depression says they are there for you you fall into a depressive episode and stay in bed all day suddenly you’re just lazy ungrateful and unmotivated when you tell them your depressed you get met with eye rolls and sighs this is extremely common you go into a relationship and the other person knows you have a panic disorder one day you’re having an episode and snap at them while in an agitated state and it leads to them complaining about how that was uncalled for and you’re just being a moody bitch no i’m not saying anyone is obligated to be supportive or be your therapist but do not pretend to be supportive towards someone with a mental illness when you will jump ship at the first symptomatic occurrence don’t claim to support friendsfamily members with mental illnesses and then get mad at them when they show symptoms and make them feel even worse disclaimer i am not saying you have to support someone with a mental illness i am saying people pretend to and then do the opposite of being supportive,0,239,1353,100,0.01

alcohol is one of the worst drugs and shouldn’t have the social acceptance it does,alcohol is deceptively innocent especially to people that haven’t done many drugs it slows down reaction times clouds judgment and pretty much makes you worse at everything in high quantities it is easily the most intoxicating substance i’ve ever consumed and can effect cognitive functioning for up to 3 days  is a huge focus on how alcohol effects driving but people don’t seem to care about how it effects the rest of your their life  and we focus on driving because it requires  us to be on the ball 100 of the time and the consequences are deadly  really don’t have any data to support the rest but my personal opinion is that getting drunk more than once a week will lower iq and job performance as well as performances on anything skill based ie  video games sports music driving dancing etc  over time you will become a shadow of the person you could have been if you weren’t drinking and to clarify i don’t mean a glass of wine at dinner or a single beer but anything more than a slight buzz regularly  alcohol will basically negativity effect every aspect of your life if you drink regularly,0,205,1133,83,0.012048192771084338

cardi b should be arrested and treated like the criminal she is,she straight admitted to drugging and robbing men she may have changed since then or maybe she hasnt idk or care she might have apologized and “righted her wrongs” but all i know is this a man especially one of cardi b’s status were to come on video  and go onto explain how he lured women into his hotel room  drugged them  robbed them and left he would be locked up for life why isn’t cardi getting the exact same treatment why isn’t anything happening why is she just getting a free pass bullshit and she deserves equal treatment for her actions make more clear i understand u can’t incriminilaize someone without any actual evidence but for example gets on camera and admits to drugging and robbing multiple women what do u think would happen to his career or life it would be completely ruined he would probably end up having an investigation on him as well  cardi no no no  this woman is perfectly clean and can get away with literally anything 2 seem to think i want her in jail  not necessarily  understand that just because she said she did it  does not make her automatically guilty but again and maybe the title is a bit misleading on this but should be treated appropriately or at the very least it should be more achknowledged and not just glossed over by her fan base and a large sum of people  don’t really give a shit about her in terms of getting arrested or put in jail i just want her to experience the same reapercussions that a male or maybe even another female would get from going on camera in 20182019 whenever it was  and then stating how u drugged and robbed menwomen  15 years ago u could get away with this  but with 2019’s cancel culture insanity i find it insane that this hasn’t been brought up when discussing cardi  all that is brought up is  queeeeen okrrrrrrrrrrrrr such a racial role model and figure” no it would be different if she was singing about it jokingly  or even if she said it in a more joking manner but no she was serious for her in the video just think for 2019  she should be treated a lot differently than she is now 3 say thank you for the gold and silver but i don’t want to be that annoying poster ya’ll gotta stop taking this so serious in the threads like damn whoever gave me platinum thx lmao,0,437,2413,64,0.03125

i dont care about school shootings and neither should you,"using my backup account for this opinion because why the fuck wouldnt i if i contended this in public id get mowed down by angry reprimands and disappointed looks but from an objective and statistical standpoint its nonsensical to give a flying fuck about school shootings heres why thats how many people have been killed in school shootings since 1965 per the washington post this averages out to approximately 23 deaths per year attributable to school shootings below are some other contributing causes of death measured in annual confirmed cases 68  terrorism lets compare school shootings to my favorite source of wildly disproportionate panic terrorism notorious for being emphatically overblown after 2001 terrorism claimed 68 deaths on united states soil in 2016 this is three times as many deaths as school shootings source
2 3885  falling whether it be falling from a cliff ladder stairs or building unintentionally falls claimed 3885 us lives in 2011 the amount of fucks i give about these preventable deaths are equivalent to moons orbiting around mercury so why considering a framework of logic and objectivity should my newsfeed be dominated by events which claim 169 times less lives than falling   source
3 80058  diabetes if you were to analyze relative media exposure of diabetes against school shootings the latter would dominate by a considerable margin yet despite diabetes claiming 80000 more lives annually 3480  1 ratio mainstream media remains fixated on overblowing the severity of school shootings source just for fun heres some wildly unlikely shit thats more likely to kill you than being shot up in a school airplanespacecraft crash  26 deaths
 drowning in the bathtub  29 deaths
 getting struck by a projectile  33 deaths
 pedestrian getting nailed by a lorry  41 deaths
 accidentally strangling yourself  116 deaths heres a new york times article titled new reality for high school students calculating the risk of getting shot complete with a picture of an injured student this article insinuates that school shootings are common enough to warrant serious consideration why else would you need to calculate the risk of it occurring what it conveniently leaves out however is the following excerpt from the washington post means the statistical likelihood of any given public school student being killed by a gun in school on any given day since 1999 was roughly 1 in 614000000 and since the 1990s shootings at schools have been getting less common the chance of a child being shot and killed in a public school is extraordinarily low percentages the probability of a randomlyselected student getting shot tomorrow is 000000000016 its a number so remarkably small that every calculator i tried automatically expresses it in scientific notation thus the probability of a child getting murdered at school is by all means and measures inconsequential there is absolutely no reason for me or you to give a flying shit about inconsequential things let alone national and global media",0,492,3830,60,0.016666666666666666

there is nothing wrong with finding other people attractive when in a relationship but you’re an asshole if you feel the need to continuously tell your partner about it,recently people have been saying how fucked up it is if you have a celebrity crush while others have said that being attracted to such people is 100 normal  i agree that finding other people attractive is just a part of being human it becomes concerning if you feel the need to continuesly tell your partner this obviously i don’t know how your relationship works so maybe you and your partner have a bond over talking about who you find attractive however if you are in a closed relationship with someone i don’t see what the point of telling them that you find someone else attractive is just keep it to yourself for example if you see someone on the street and think they look cute why would you tell your partner about how cute they look or if you have a celebrity crush on an attractive celebrity why won’t you just have that fantasy in your head what will telling your partner who probably doesn’t compare to that celebrity do  nothing they can really do with that information to me it just seems like a way to try and get a reaction out of someone or to see if they’d get jealous or not if you don’t get jealous by that stuff that’s great and shows that you are confident in yourself however if you do get jealous by this stuff there’s nothing wrong with you for doing so they should keep their fantasies to themself   it’s 100 natural to find other people attractive in a relationship but feeling the need to continuously tell your partner who you find attractive is an asshole move i thought this was unpopular due to the amount of people saying “they won’t meet the celebrity anyways so it doesn’t matter” in this thread 2 i find it funny how many people are angry at how “this isn’t unpopular at all” but i’m getting a very large amount of comments about how childish and somehow controlling this viewpoint is which one is it cock sounding pretty good rn,0,348,2101,169,0.005917159763313609

there needs to be a small dick acceptance movement before i even begin to give a shit about fat acceptance for women,perhaps this isnt an unpopular opinion but im a bi man who hasnt ever gotten with another man but i talk to gay men a lot ive never engaged with it for my own personal reasons but thats besides the point dont think many women realize how fucking horrible it is for a man to have a small dick how emasculating it is to be judged solely on something that you have absolutely no control over my size isnt great either but ive come to accept it however i know many men who simply cant and most women and society at large do nothing to support a person with a small dick  i see all the normal shit about fat acceptance or otherwise loving women no matter what size they are i laugh because they can fucking change their size a man cant a woman can get larger breasts a man cant increase his size why should i focus my energy on making those who can change their situation or otherwise in the case of fat people put themselves in the situation to begin with feel more comfortable about themselves while those who cant do anything to help their situation arent even fucking mentioned in the mainstream until its convenient rise in hookup culture is only doing more harm many men cant stack up whats considered average size is in many cases thought of as small while its taboo to shame a woman for their body small dick jokes seem as if they are completely fair game and the hypocrisy is absolutely disgusting to me as an addendum id like to also take the time to bitch about men with bigger dicks  i can say is fuck most of you you treat your smaller brothers like shit most of the time thinking youre fucking special or you did something to earn your sexual prowess fuck off it was luck of the god damn draw you should be getting on your knees and thanking whatever cosmic force responsible for bestowing your prowess unto you while the rest of the population has to carefully disclose their size to every partner wondering in the back of their mind if they truly dont care even though i accept my size its about 5 and a half inches i know i could have it a lot worse and many men do i still have it in the back of my mind that whoever im with isnt actually satisfied with my size like they say they are im glad you fucks dont ever have to deal with that because i wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy to be honest  2 i would like to address some comments and common replies and also give a brief overview of my thoughts thus far didnt think this was going to blow up like it did im glad it did to be honest because it really put some things in perspective for me  id like to address this ludicrous notion that i hate women i dont know how i can prove to any of you that i dont hate women other than me saying i dont i may have used harsh words but my words were not to disparage any one group just for existing my problem was purely with the double standards with the noninclusion of men in the mainstream body positive movement  understand and agree that fat acceptance is something we should be concerned about no one should be made to feel horrible about themselves based on their body by other people my main point was i believe we should be striving for an all inclusive body positive movement that encompasses everyone from burn victims to people with major deformaties to men and women whom have insecurities i never said one couldnt have a fat positive movement despite my disagreements with it due to the unhealthy side effects encouraging obesity can lead to but thats besides the point i simply longed for an all inclusive body positive movement to be pushed just as much if not more than the fat acceptance movement i get that caring about one thing within a movement doesnt necessarily negate your concern for other issues but from where im sitting it doesnt seem like a lot of men get the same amount of support for their body issues by comparison of women perhaps thats just my confirmation bias and if thats the case i apologize and acknowledge my fault and before anyone addresses it im not even necessarily advocating for a small dick movement despite the title that was mostly just for flair and to discuss the notion of body positive movements not including men and i used penis size as an example what i really want is inclusivity of everyone  topic id like to address is the idea that women cant hide the fact that theyre fat men dont broadcast their dick size so its not as much of a daily struggle by comparison of fat people while i understand the logic i dont really see how its productive sexual relationships is a huge part of humanity as a whole many of us crave it strive for it make it the focus of our daily lives in some cases whether we want to or not when a person feels inadequate about themselves this can have major implications on a persons psyche if left untreated it can have damaging effects on ones personality and mental state which ultimately harms them on the day to day i understand thats not a healthy way to go about it they should be seeking help themselves but i feel many men are discouraged from talking about it its made out to be as if it doesnt matter which is why im encouraging an all inclusive body positive movement but i feel the main point those who say this are trying to make is that theres more pressure put on society to accept ones outward appearance that is visible to the naked eye and i agree with that but all im really saying is we should be reaching higher  obviously cant be the judge of my own character but i believe im a bit of an idealist for better or worse i sincerely believe humanity coming together as a whole is not only possible but necessary for humanity to advance in any meaningful way whether it was your intent or not having a body positive movement that is pushed in the mainstream that is only really geared towards supporting one group can lead to feelings of neglect for another  topic that was brought up was about my abrasiveness many thought i was an asshole in my post and i would agree with that i admit im a bit of a douchebag but thats why i dont want to be the one leading the charge so to speak many suggested that i should start the movement myself but im simply not the right person for the job im hot headed i sometimes dont think before i speak and many people tend to vehemently disagree with my opinions im a private person despite how i am online with anonymity in real life i am a bit of a hermit and have horrible anxiety when placed in uncomfortable positions i also dont feel it would even be taken seriously given the replies i see posts of people posting this post on other subs to bitch about it runpopularopinion where white men go to whine about shit no one cares about i knew there would be opposition to this post and i was prepared for it but some of the replies honestly make me feel like shit perhaps rightly so because im a bit of a dick but love me or hate me i stand by most of what i said  sincerely hope that if you take away anything from this its that we shouldnt be focusing on advancing one particular group supporting one particular group culturally speaking im not talking about specific diseases or aggretious physical phenomena i care about people despite what many of you may believe and all i really want is peace and acceptance of everybody aside from douchebags who think theyre better than everyone else ie in regards to the first edit about people who flaunt their bigger dicks last major point id like to address is many people believe me to be insecure somehow me being insecure invalidates the very real lack of support for males in this department ill admit that sure i wish i had a bigger dick i feel a bit shitty about it at times but for the most part i can tolerate it ive had partners who didnt care and i genuinely believe them i know theyre out there its just a matter of finding them so you can call me an insecure whiny little bitch all you want but youre only proving my point   last thing is i really do appreciate the discussion there are a lot of points i strongly disagree with that i didnt address here and there are many ideas i really should think over and reevaluate myself and i thank  everyone for giving me the opportunity,0,1553,8498,117,0.02564102564102564

i dont respect 10 as a number,"i dislike it i wish ill upon it there is no reason that a number as unremarkable as 10 should be given such a high stature 
 10 is a cool number and is essential for almost everything you might say absolute bollocks i can write an essay about how bad 10 is but to keep it relatively short the only reason 10 is considered special is because we follow the base 10 decimal number system it has just this one thing going on for it but guess what base 10 is a horrendous way to count there are many superior versions like base 12 and base 6 that are easy to learn and more viable especially when doing division also finger counting is better in base 6 so please dont spread your humans have ten fingers propaganda
 i know the metric system and all existing documentation are in base 10 but thats just one of the ways big decimal shills are manipulating you do you really want to use a bad number system just because it has always been like that what is this if not stockholm syndrome if you dont want to become a mere statistic its high time you stand up for yourself

  i loathe how the number 10 is glorified and admired by people

 yes i know it is not intuitive to count in other bases but thats just because you have been accustomed to decimal analogous to language it is hard to pick up a new one
 i am aware the metric system will get destroyed if we change the base thats not the point if we had chosen a different base at inception then metric system math and day to day life would have evolved with it making that version of counting just as intuitive as decimal",0,304,1640,31,0.03225806451612903

the reason kids spend their days in front of a screen is because youve fucked up all alternative forms of entertainment,people often tend to blame the technology itself when complaining about kids these days spending all their time with their phones consoles and so on but i dont think videogames and youtube are something like the ultimate form of entertainment theyre great and i love them sure but i dont think theyre that addictive or special to get all of a kids interest by themselves after all kids get bored by everything really soon dont they look at alternative more traditional forms of entertainment im only 28 and i can already see how much theyve changed i used to ride my bike all day long since i was 6 or 7 years old now its too dangerous for some reason and many kids will only be allowed to do it while the parents are watching same for going to the pool or river for a swim feel like playing some football well a drop of rain fell two hours ago so no way even just for going to the park there used to be almost no parents there unless their oldest kid was something like 5 years old now there are more parents that children and theres yet another problem in some areas there are just no other children around perhaps in dozens of kilometres most drastic example i used to have play fights with my siblings cousins friends and classmates all the time sometimes even in front of my parents sometimes even the parents were cheering im not saying thats necessarely a good thing but its unthinkable only a couple of decades later and dont even get me started on fighting in the water which ive probably done like a million times these are just examples i have a few reasons to believe im right about this helicopterparenting being the reason behind kids loving their phones so much first in an era of videogames with graphics and playability that we wouldnt even dream of not that long ago youd expect things like chess to be almost disappearing well chess is stronger than eve whether in my town my country or my planet the number of kids playing chess tournaments does not stop to grow also at least in my experience this trend had started way before things like social media were mainstream already by the time i was 12 or so i noticed kids younger than me spent a lot of time watching tv and i wasnt the only one and finally just compare different types of parents the rules they put and what their children do think of those two annoying bored kids in a family dinner if parents force them to stay at the table give them a tablet theyll be on the tablet but what if they are allowed to leave the points im making here are strongly regiondependent and may not apply to your particular country or society ill use my own as a reference and if the situation in yours is wildly different id love to hear about that contrast in the comments note i wanted the title to say weve fucked up rather than youve i was going to copypaste rewrite the title and post again but there were already some comments so ill leave it as it is so you can see that im dumb,0,553,3110,120,0.008333333333333333

you should be able to honestly tell your so if they have gained weight to the point of you losing physical attraction towards them and you shouldn’t be labelled as a “bad person  ahole etc” if you do so,tldr  you should be able to straightforwardly and respectfully express to your so if they gained weight to the point you start losing desire for their body if you both consider sex  and physical attraction vital for your relationship  before anything else please read  so let me start by saying i deleted most of my text as those lines dont really serve purpose they were indeed too long to even consider reading through  the other thing is i have to admit that this post was rushed and yes i am quite inconsiderate in it for reference see my content below and some of my replies the funny thing is that while i might think some commenters are oversensitive i have the other end of the spectrum insensitiveness to some extent and i can also get oversensitive i dont regret what i wrote it was a start for a good lesson but reading through some well thoughtout opinions my selfreflection started to operate some of you made the assumption that i must not have a lot of experience regarding relationships thats right and sometimes i turn into this arrogant person who likes to believe she knows it all btw im female for those who thought otherwise the reactions are just as harsh as my statement but its okay i can understand that what i said can be an effective method in some relationships  thats great and cannot be applied in others which is also valid and at the end im the one who should have stayed more flexible i should have considered more factors i want to apologize about that honestly so thank you all for responding and expressing your viewpoints now ill have a lot to think about and a lot to work on im not afraid to face judgement if thats what people feel like giving me based on my content so thank you for offering the experience i appreciate both the agreements and disagreements ill try and digest them properly in the following days im still think that im right about some aspects but not anymore do i believe my reasoning is flawless i wanted everyone who engaged in  this conversation to know that is not kindness honesty is honesty period i don’t mean you have to be cruel about it but you shouldn’t put honesty aside in favor of toning serious things down you can be honest and respectful and showing care without being overly soft towards your partner if you can’t take it well the problem is you and not the other person and yes it is applicable to those who have mental health issues too can’t just tiptoe around a topic that is basically one of the most essential foundingfactors of a sexual relationship partner should be able to freely speak hisher mind again respectfully and kindly enough which is still not too “soft”  and how you react to that is your responsibility the partner doesn’t have to just accept the fact you gained weight just because it’s a sensitive topic to you i wonder why it’s so sensitive… does matter we have a right to voice what we like and by putting away our own ego we should be more flexible dealing with and communicating it,0,550,3126,206,0.014563106796116505

90 of beauty standards women feel are enforced by other women not men,its crazy to me that theres so much talk about toxic masculinity but toxic femininity is ingrained in our society and no one bats an eye  vogue fashion shows reality tv who is really perpetuating the unattainable standards for women to be skinny to have matching outfits to wear loads of makeup and possess flashy jewelry most guys in my experience never complain or even notice shit like that but every woman i have known talks shit behind other girls backs or to their face and a lot of these are impressionable young girls that drive so much toxicity  if were talking about gender standards there has been a huge reverse in standards against men in the last decade if men even desire a woman to be in shape or presentable theres an uproar of sexism but most women are able to have a laundry list of expectations for men and it goes unchecked its ludicrous women have unnecessary beauty standards placed on them but it has nothing to do with men this is toxic femininity and its dangerous sorry this was so long okay obviously i didnt expect this to blow up as much as it did so i would like to clarify some things  this thread was not made to bash women whatsoever i have no control over the comments made here or if they misconstrued my original point people who are using this as a platform to ridicule women are doing the exact opposite of having a civil debate i am simply drawing attention to the fact that we as males are told constantly why we are perpetuating toxic masculinity but there are huge examples of toxic femininity in our society and this is one of them people refuting this with facts or having a civil discussion thank you those calling me mysogynistic or saying this post is a circle jerk i think its important to look outside your bias and see maybe women have a lot to work on if they want to strive for a less toxic society it starts with themselves calling for women to be held accountable is not mysogynistic,0,360,2022,71,0.0
my faith in humanity isn’t restored when i see something like the bullied girl with a disability wins homecoming queen call me cynical but it really feels like an ego boost for the people who voted for her disabled people and bullied people aren’t your charity case,you see it all over social media and the news headlines that read “there are still good people in this world she was bullied for her disability but her classmates voted her for prom queen” or “star basketball players stands up for his bullied classmate” sure it seems sweet at first but when i think about it all i can see is someone doing something “nice” for their own personal gain when these stories make the news who usually gets the most publicity who gets the interviews and good press why the people who did the “good deed” of course most of the time it seems like they don’t give a damn about the person who they did something “nice” for instead it’s about “look what we did we are so nice we are so good hearted” it’s all about making themselves feel better when they go to sleep at night it’s almost never about the person it should be about it’s not sweet and heartwarming it’s almost sort of heartbreaking because i’ve seen instances where people will do “nice things” for someone because they take pity on the person and it makes them look good in the eyes of others but go right back to treating that same person like shit as soon as nobody else is paying attention it was never about being nice and genuine it was all a big ego boost if you want to do something nice do it when nobody’s looking and don’t accept any congratulations for your good deed like i said in a reply to a commenter sure its a “nice thing to do” and in some cases it makes the disabled person feel good and it’s a nice gesture all around but disabled people aren’t mindless angel pets they have brains and lots of them don’t like to feel pitied or patronized especially when that pity is superficial and the people who give her those pity votes will go right back to ignoring or bullying the disabled person i’m not saying “don’t ever be nice because people could misconstrue your motives” i am saying however that you should be mindful of your actions and be careful not to make people feel patronized and pitied also if you’re gonna do something nice for someone make sure you’re being genuine be consistent with your actions towards someone don’t be nice one day and then cruel the next i know that all good deeds are a little selfish and that’s not my main issue here the motive isn’t the issue either it’s the fact that people see others who happen to have a disability as nothing more than a sad little animal to feel sorry for instead of mistreating someone doing one “nice” thing either because you feel sorry for them or you want wholesomeness clout or both and then going right back to treating that person like shit you could be genuine in the first place and treat them like any other human being and maybe even develop a true friendship with them my issue is the publicity and praise people get for being insincere and inconsistent i really don’t give that much of a shit about “prom queen” or shit like that anyway i’m using it as an example i’m almost 20 years old and when i was younger i never ran for those positions anyhow another example could be like people in the comments said giving a homeless guy 90 and filming it to post on youtube instead of patronizing the guy maybe hire him to help you wash your car or do some yard work and then pay him for his labor that way he won’t feel pitiful and have such low self esteem make him feel like he’s not a helpless invalid,0,633,3437,268,0.014925373134328358

oversexualisation is the worst thing weve done as a culture,sex sells its a common marketing thing and guess what its successful because its true but theres now been such an over saturation of sex being used to sell that its everywhere  those perfume adverts for one why the hell does a perfume require two half naked people in bed and the man smelling the pillow as the girl struts off another example in the uk an advert for being bikini body ready was removed from the underground for being too sexy it was on a massive wall on the station platform  too hot to handle is my bugbear for this one right now a bunch of sexy adults being told not to have sex for a cash prize and acting like its the worst thing in the world also reality tv in general has become about sexiness the kardashians for one  the sheer number of inappropriate music videos is scary not to mention the performances on stage extent of sexualisation is profound so much so that i think we as a western culture have become used to it i have a friend from sri lanka when he came to the uk he said that there was so much sexualisation that he was initially overwhelmed and was looking for sex everywhere really hope that in the future we realise that weve exploited ourselves and our youth i hope theres time to change holy shit this blew up and holy shit my first awards thanks redditors this one is divisive a couple of points yes genocide war slavery are definitely worse then this but as a modern western generation we did not perpetuate these things i am speaking as someone who has seen a buildup of these factors calling me prude or boomer doesnt give an actual point,0,300,1683,60,0.016666666666666666

the “you’ll never use math and science outside of school” narrative in america is horrible counterproductive and for the most part not even true,i mean has the united states of america ever needed math and science more in its history than right now telling students this ingrains for the rest of their life complacency and disregard for the world around them  and science classes don’t always have direct application no but calling them useless because of that is a naive oversimplification these classes teach critical thinking these classes teach problem solving these classes teach our students how to think about things  understand the benefit in telling a student that is struggling in math class that heshe is not destined to be a failure because of it but that is totally separate from “bragging” especially around young people that you don’t use math in your career even though you probably do even if you don’t realize it that is being a bad influence on a very easily influenced population of people  is money science is life you don’t have to be a rocket scientist for these things to be important and just because you fix air conditioners or sell cars for a living doesn’t mean you are absolved of them in fact that ignorance makes you way more prone to someone who does not share it taking advantage of you in life  “i never use math in my job” and similar schoolisuseless narratives are the last thing students need to be hearing especially right now  did not mean to imply that only americans face this problem i was just speaking on what i know and didn’t want to generalize  i feel like most people in the comments are missing the point i’m not arguing that you do or don’t need the literal skill of math i’m arguing that you should not give students and young people reason to have distrust in maths and sciences just because you don’t need to know how to graph a line at your day job i know that the intended message is not harmful but the interpretation of it deeeefinitely can be 2  it common practice in these parts to comment your opinion without actually reading the source post seriously seems like 75 of the comments aren’t even on the same page,0,370,2119,148,0.013513513513513514

there were better femaleempowering shows and movies 20 years ago than there are today,this came up while discussing movies with my sister i asked if she finds it cool that so many women are now getting important roles in the entertainment industry she said something like “i’m not sure if they got the roles cuz they’re good and female or just because of the latter” and it really opened my eyes  current femalecentric reboots are mostly flopping things like wonder woman being exceptions i found terminator power rangers castle etc way cooler when they made them equals with men and not simply trash them also wasn’t it more inspiring when women made it big back then i remember when the chess player judith polgar became famous and was right up there with the men now with a separate chess league for women nobody really cares about it but i’m digressing rangers vs the new ghostbusters is my point females were part of the original pr team in almost equal numbers they usually wore pink and such feminine colour but equally kicked butts in battles that was awesome the new ghostbusters isn’t  i’m just not sure that if a woman wins an award that was usually maledominated was the reason really merit twentyyears ago it surely would have been to answer so many questions on the existence of separate chess leagues for men and women yes i’m not making this up women can if they want compete and get ranked along with the men but almost nobody does this because of the huge rating difference although this was challenged by judit and now by hou when she boycotted a tournament as she wasn’t getting any male opponents despite her wanting to compete with men,0,282,1635,87,0.011494252873563218

men dont enjoy the romance genre because it doesnt look at all like romance to us it looks like work,"i have a friend who is baffled why men dont enjoy movies or books in the romance genre she says its because men are often too insecure in themselves to feel like they can enjoy that sort of thing 

 my opinion its a lot more simple and upsetting where women look at romance novels and see love and caring men look at them and see work 

 be fair sometimes these movies and novels hide it pretty well maybe it starts with a happenstance encounter a meet cute the relationship will progress  sometimes it will look like its by accident loving glances are exchanged meaningful gestures of affection are performed eventually things reach a head and the characters begin ravishing each other unable to keep their affection hidden any longer 

 most women will see is a guy who is empathetic and open and aboundingly loving 

 most men will see is a horrifying amount of work and luck these novels and movies often treat the man as an almost omniscient entity he does everything perfectly and knows exactly how to make someone swoon he is expected to have boundless confidence work to continually push the relationship forward work to make gestures of affection work and to not want or need any affection in return work 
 romance is work and a lot of people have been sold the idea that its simply a natural thing you do if you love your partner its only partially true  you do it because you love your partner but its work nonetheless

 theres absolutely a reason i dont like romance movies  its not because they are feelsy or goofy or anything its because when i look at them i know im expected to feel loved by making someone else feel loved and that doesnt really feel like romance to me
 this is about unequal work so many times the guy goes incredibly far out of his way to woo the girl but the guy never is wooed back its often treated like the woman continuing to say yes and allowing herself to be wooed is an equal amount of reciprocation and i feel as if its not good relationships are about mutual affection and ideally it shouldnt feel like work but its easy for affection to turn into work if its unfairly distributed or never reciprocated  because romantic gestures require effort even if they arent work 
 2 to all the comments that suggest these movies show men actually putting in the effort most women do in their relationships i would advise you to take a load off in your next relationship and hold yourself to the standards these movies portray men
 edit god the amount of people in the comments that are losing their minds at a man daring to desire to be romanced is truly saddening",0,480,2750,106,0.05660377358490566

gun safety safety training should be a mandatory class in high school,"the justification for sex education is that ignorance is more dangerous than knowledge the same holds true for firearms far too many people are shot with unloaded guns ignorance of what guns are and how they work is more dangerous than people knowing what they are what they can do and how to safely handle them even if you believe that guns should be banned the legal process for accomplishing this in the us would take decades its extremely difficult to alter our constitution theres considerable opposition to changing it and the political reality it that it is easier to leave the constitution the way it is than it is to change it consequently even if you want to ban all guns it still makes sense to teach kids to safely handle them as an interim solution
2 teaching kids how to safely handle firearms will not help them shoot up a school someone who has never handled one before can figure out how to fire it within a few minutes especially with movies computer games and google as a guide firearms are designed to be as easy to use as possible using them destructively is extremely easy consequently handling them safely is harder than using them destructively and requires training
3 you dont need to bring guns into schools to teach kids how to safely handle them for the same reason you dont need to have sex in the classroom to teach kids how to use a condom
4 for those who arent from the us to understand why the us is obsessed with guns you have to understand us history the us was founded by rebels who were rebelling against a tyrannical  government and they wanted to retain the ability to rebel against their  new government should it also become tyrannical this is as true today as it was the day it was written a reasonable argument can be made that  the second amendment protects weapons which are necessary for  overthrowing our own government should it become tyrannical its a  healthy thing for our politicians to be a little afraid of us
5 requiring gun safety training background checks and licenses at the point of sale simply doesnt work there are a plethora of ways that your child can encounter a gun without purchasing one for example i very vividly remember climbing into my parents attic  through the ceiling of an unfinished bathroomwhich im certain they  didnt think i could do and showing my friends without the knowledge of their parents one of my dads rifles for no other reason than because i thought it was really cool no one died but someone easily could have i had no fucking idea what i was doing there is simply no way that any law or  requirement at the point of sale can prevent scenarios like that from happening
6 teaching kids to shoot guns isnt the point the point is to teach kids how to avoid firing a gun by accident if they encounter one
7 not everyone will own a gun and not everyone will encounter a gun during their life however the problem is that we dont know which kids will encounter guns and which wont therefore the only way to teach gun safety to the kids who need it is to teach it to all of them",0,563,3149,69,0.014492753623188406

i genuinely dont understand how anyone likes 6ix9ine and the fact that they do makes me lose faith in society,"6ix9ine is absolutely disgusting in the things he was convicted of and got away with and i just dont think he deserves an ounce of popularity now that hes gotten away from all that he confessed to recording and distributing a video of a man having sex with a 13yearold girl and yet he is literally one of the most prominent artists of 2020 so far lot of the people who like him are millennials and zoomers who i believed to be progressive enough to shut this type of shit down yet here we are this guy is out here topping the charts and everything he says and does is absolutely blown up and near impossible to ignore if youre someone who tries to stay to date with the newest music and media genuinely dont understand it and im disgusted by it i also just dont get how he has a likeable appearance either if were going to the more shallow part of my opinion hes fucking ugly and has purposely destroyed his physical appearance and looks like he hasnt bathed in weeks he is always getting in trouble and flaming other people and he is just everything a person shouldnt be and yet he is at the top of the game and unfortunately succeeding personally believe he deserves the opposite of everything hes gained in these past few months i also no longer like anyone who decides to work with him its one thing to separate the art from the artist but to boast the artist by openly  proudly working with the artist looking at nicki makes you seem like you have no problem with working with that sick asshole  
       thanks for the gold i never had it before and i really really appreciate it also i really have enjoyed reading everyones thoughts on him makes me feel like im less crazy and moreso its just he has high numbers because people like the hype music more than they do him but it still messes with me a bit that theres a little girl out there that has to see him all over the charts after what he did partook in doing to her thats all i care about not the people he snitched out they probably had it coming if they had shit that needed to be snitched about to begin with it just saddens me to think about her  feel the same way for all other screwed up celebrities whos crimes went under the radar and they were never properly held accountable and still were able to thrive i just have never seen a guy straight up make cp and then get a slap on the wrist and become more famous than he was before its bizzare stop yapping thanks again for the gold kind stranger and thank you guys for giving me your opinions and what you think its been interesting to read",0,497,2663,111,0.009009009009009009
american colleges shouldnt force you to take classes irrelevant to your career path,"according to my understanding most of the world doesnt require you to have an undergraduate degree to go into medical school with their medical school just being 6 years long in america to become be in a medical career you need 8 years of school vs the 6 years at other countries 
 those 8 years of school i must take philosophy sociology and speech to get an undergraduate in biology there are some classes you can wriggle an argument for like physics 1 or writing but probably not physics 2 or speech

 colleges just want to make you well rounded makes you sound like and i hate using this term a sheep to my understanding american colleges were more identical to the rest of the worlds some time ago not 100 sure on that so by saying that colleges want to make you more wellrounded is like saying previous generations of stem field grads werent or even grads from other countries that is  taking philosophy for 1 semester isnt going to turn my life upside down not 90° not 45° not even 1°
 ok i understand and agree that philosophy is important however learning that other countries do not require 8 years of education to be in a medical field makes me irritated at my beloved country i just used philosophy as pet peeve to get a point across 1 semester of a particular liberal art feels more like an excuse to siphon money especially if it is considered vital for an undergraduate that is completely irrelevant hell my school has bio ethics i havent taken it yet but that seems like a lovely way to possibly blend philosophy and biology keeping it relevant 
  honestly feels like colleges just want our money at the expense of the students lives allowing students 2 more years in their 20s ideally and less debt to deal with can save them so many more problems",0,325,1846,85,0.023529411764705882

babies should be banned from the cinema,babies under the age of 1 maybe even 2 should be outright banned from movie theaters i mean why would you even take them in the first place ive just been to see a pg13 film and a group walked in with 5 babies all ages between around 3 months too maybe a year there was an audible grown from the rest of the crowd pretty much as soon as they walked in through the door why do the staff even let them take them in to all the people saying this is a popular opinion it appears you may be right judging by how much this blew up but there are still so many people who still bring babies to the cinema 2 alot of people talking about children at cinemas this i personally dont have a problem with even 3 and 4 year olds if they can comprehend whats going on then fine if they cause a disturbance its up to the parents to sort them out or the stewards to throw them out but when its a literal baby there is no reason for them to be at any film in a cinema they have no comprehension of whats going on its not their fault its loud and can cause damage to there ears they almost guaranteed to cause a disturbance and all these people saying well i agree but have taken my baby to it because they are so well behaved your still damaging a babys hearing just so you can go and see a fucking film,0,261,1313,39,0.02564102564102564
toxic femininity should be just as much of a thing as toxic masculinity,not all women are toxic just like not all men are but it seems like we turn a blind eye when women start behaving in toxic ways whether it’s uncontrollable bitching habits or when they start judging women and men based on what they’re wearing and their aesthetics some women tend to be a lot more superficial when it comes to what they look for in appearances eg height weight etc it also seems to be accepted by society a lot more than when men start demanding women to look and act a certain way  another irritating thing is that women tend to stick to the same topics it’s like they’re so brainwashed with their priorities the narrative that your worth is based on your appearance seems to be growing with the age of instagram which tends to be dominated by half naked women constantly seeking validation by how many likes they get  i’m a woman who has a lot of girlfriends maybe i just have shitty friends but it seems to be a growing trend on who can be more superficial and shallow these days,0,188,1026,72,0.013888888888888888
the majority of offended people will fake emotional outrage in order to terminate any civil discussion,in my anecdotal observation many people who quickly escalate their outrage have done so to manipulate the core of discussion from one that revolves around facts and data to one that focuses solely on feelings and perceived virtue through victimhood they perceive their outrage to be virtuous and that the more outraged they are about said topic the more virtue they hold over you the argument quickly becomes less about the topic and more about you as an opponent disingenuous motives under the guise of righteousness is what makes this behaviour particularly reprehensible two human beings should be able to have a civil disagreement on anything  even if one the persons views are seemingly ridiculous earth being flat etc to be open minded you must try to understand why they believe what they believe and maybe stand a chance of educating them or at least coming out of the conversation better understanding the root cause of their misguided beliefs maybe i’m too much of an optimist to clarify this is obviously a generalisation and doesn’t apply to all cases it also does not appeal to the idea that someone who is outraged is wrong and someone who isn’t is right i could have the patience of a saint and still be wrong and i often am the key is that ones emotional state does not provide moral status and should not be the habitual basis through which you win arguments there is nothing wrong with being an emotional person at heart for other reasons,0,255,1500,102,0.00980392156862745

gmo’s are not bad and are not unhealthy,this isn’t really an opinion but everyone seems to think so i’m under the impression that people don’t even know what genetically modified even means and everyone is falling for propaganda that companies are using to mark up their products  modified crops most of the time are crops that have been through artificial selection that means we noticed a couple of plants that we were growing produced bigger fruit with less seeds or they are less likely to die from weather or from pests or etc so bred them with each other to create the plant that we enjoy today this is something that happens naturally through evolution and natural selection as well there’s nothing crazy or unhealthy about it it doesn’t change the fruit or vegetables nutrition very much and it certainly doesn’t make it less healthy  way we genetically modify which is less likely is that we give the plant dna that does all the things artificial selection does like pest resistance longer growing season bigger fruit etc except it takes a way shorter time it is actually very helpful environmentally because it reduces the use pesticides there arent any adverse health effects it’s still just a fruit or vegetable there are positive environmental effects  big point is that there are only something like 10 crops that are genetically modified and sold in america so when something says “non gmo” it never would’ve had gmos anyway it doesn’t make it healthier i got a chocolate bar that said “non gmo” and i was like  this is totally just a marketing scheme  this makes sense and doesn’t get removed,0,275,1640,40,0.075

instagram is ruining everything a rant,"i think that instagram is one of the worst developments in modern culture let me explain ig is the most shallow of all social media platforms while social media platforms like twitter and sometimes even facebook politically engage people allow them to connect and organise instagram is solely based on one person and their lookslifevacation no political or important dialogue is happening i would argue that even pinterest is more worthwile since at least diys teach you something
2 ig is all fake but everyone pretends that its real why we are all pretty much aware from our own instagram use that these images are usually not what our lives look like all instagram users apparently have this pact that they are just all going to believe each others bullshit
3 ig is bad for your mental health because unrealistic standards are set on instagram but everyone just pretends like theyre real people doing real things it feels like everybodys life is the way it looks in ig this also creates feelings of inadequacy and is therefore detrimental to especially young peoples mental health see also this article  i also think this applies equally to women and men since the unrealistic standards concerning looks and lifestyle are more than ever directed towards both genders while they previously were more directed towards women as in eg advertising  additionally the dopamine rush people get from likes creates an almost addictionlike potential that makes them use the app more and more and making the mental health issues even more pronounced
4 ig makes people vain taking pictures of yourself all day makes you the center of your own attention and that leads to ignoring other people and the actual experience youre documenting its not about where you went what you ate or what incredible experience you had but only what it looked like and what you looked like doing it this makes everybody focus more and more on their own appearance and less about things that actually make you a successful human being
5 ig gives the worst incentives to people the reason i am ranting right now is that i saw a vice video about a poppy field in california that is killed by people sitting and stepping on it to take pictures predominantly for instagram video  they then talked to the people taking the pictures asking them why theyre doing it and their answers made me incredibly angry some people were open about just wanting likes but some others pretended like they were really concerned about the flowers talking about the feeling of being one with nature so these people want to signal to others that they love nature and the beauty of it while literally destroying the natural habitat and the flowers this shows that they really dont care about anything at all except their likes on a goddamn picture now i dont think that they are inherently bad people but i think that instagram actively gives them an incentive to be this way fuelled by the addictive potential of the platform and the likes you get from it would encourage anyone reading this to please examine how much time you spend on instagram and if you get anything from it than a simple dopamine rush and feelings of inadequacy and think of what you could do thats more meaningful and actually makes you happy a lot of people are posting that they follow artists architects blacksmiths etc and use instagram predominantly in a small community or niche so just to clarify i do think that one can use instagram positively and get a lot of good content from it what i wanted to point out in my post is the culture that evolved around instagram and especially individual people posting nothing but their lives and while some of you are so blessed as to not experience this culture in your everyday lives i feel like for others the posting cute pictures of oneself is a crucial part of social life eg kids in middlehigh school i do think that every social media platform can be great since it really depends on the users and what they post however i feel that while some good instagram accounts exist the majority is selfies vacation and food pictures and that this makes some people feel that they to share this much of their lives as well",0,733,4529,40,0.025

stop referring to your kid as a 24 month old instead of a 2 year old,idk why i think this is so strange but why do people insist on using months of age instead of years after their kid has reached a year old  like why is it so common for parents to be like “oh his age he’s 33 months ” please ma’am he’s a toddler now he can speak words just say years so what i’m hearing is it’s about milestones medically speaking at least  but if it’s not in a medical setting why continue to say months instead of years after a certain point  i completely understand if you’re going to a doctor or maybe actually having a conversation about milestones with someone else but if you’re posting on facebook about your “36 month old” or talking to me in person about your “25 month old”  why not refer to them as a toddler them milestones have passed,0,150,790,68,0.0
alcohol is the worst drug our world has today,the social norm of alcohol is fairly sickening the idea of fun like holidays or vacation or parties or birthdays is usually tied to drinking and alcohol dependency is crippling families across the world on a scale that no other drug competes with puking drunk driving loud obnoxious behavior sexual harassment and down right embarrassing behavior is a normality that couples drinking people saying “heroin is worsecoke is worse” i’ve seen addiction in all shapes and sizes between first hand witnessing heroin overdoses to living with a cocainecrack addict to having a best friend addicted to meth not a single one of those drugs is as widespread popular and accessible as alcohol is nor are they socially acceptable as a society as a whole no other drugs come close to the damage alcohol has caused that’s a fact though i guess it wouldn’t be an unpopular opinion if people weren’t disagreeing with me to every alcoholic commenting about their hardships with drinking and overcoming them remember that you are not you when you drink and that being able to address that you in fact have a drinking problem is a giant step in the right direction to recovery as someone who battled with addiction themselves i support each and every one of you in hopes that you make your goal a reality your loved ones will appreciate the time they can share with you sober more than any other gift you could give them this holiday season but remember to be careful when trying to quit drinking and to seek medical advice when attempting to quit after being a long time binge drinker as shakes and seizures can be life threatening and you may need additional help to ween yourself off of the alcohol,0,294,1713,45,0.022222222222222223

as a former pothead i consider marijuana to be a much more harmful drug than people consider it to be,the thing about marijuana is not that its physically harmful its mentally and emotionally harmful it encourages you to use it habitually it might not be physically addicting but its certainly highly psychologically addicting how many people do you know who use marijuana casually the problem is that people abuse it frequently and it causes them to suffer or atrophy in other areas of their lives or they use it to cope with something else theyre not willing to confront me i used weed as an excuse to not participate in society rather than see my friends i would just get stoned and turn off my phone i wouldnt talk to anyone or go out i was afraid to go out so i used weed as an excuse not to caused me to have low self esteem i thought of myself as a loser pothead  because i was i think many potheads feel this way but they would never admit it to anyone else once i finally decided to drop it once and for all my life has improved so drastically i felt like a human again like a member of society and i realized that it hardly even did anything for me anyway it turned me into a stupid person im not stupid think the damage that marijuana does is complex but significant i think the culture surrounding it and its reputation as a safe drug is extremely dangerous quote the great and wise randy marsh stan the truth is marijuana probably isnt gonna make you kill people and it most likely isnt gonna fund terrorism but… well son pot makes you feel fine with being bored and its when youre bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or being creative if you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you arent good at anything this thread really blew up so i would add on if you feel youre in a similar situation to mine my best advice is to reconnect with friends and focus on your abilities skills and talents when i quit i focused more on my creative writing and that built my self esteem like crazy i realized that the feeling of fulfillment and happiness i got from doing this every day was far greater than the meager feeling of being high that i got from marijuana im now on track to finish my first novel by the end of the year lot of comments are talking about how moderation is key and not everyone uses it the same my question is why use this drug at all what does it help you with and for whatever problem it is is there another more organic way you could solve this problem for example if you have anxiety maybe you can work on therapy or confronting this issue and trying to get some closure you feel the need to get high every day ask yourself do i enjoy life without this drug and if not try to figure out why that is and what could help to change it,0,523,2829,103,0.019417475728155338

encouraging children in school to have perfect attendance is detrimental to their health now and it forms unhealthy work habits that will follow them for the rest of their lives,"schools in my area at least have been allowing fewer days for leave for sickness and becoming more strict on how and when those days are used this is to encourage perfect attendance and it is harmful to the child in more than one way  the child is pressured into attending school even when sick further suppressing an immune system that is already stressed by environmental factors this can lead to a number of complications for the child both short and long term from leaving them susceptible to secondary infection to the development of autoimmune disorders if the child is taught to take proper care of their health and to heal when they are ill then they will be better off in both regards
2 the child is being conditioned to work ill the future can never change to allow for better work conditions if the next generation does not progress beyond what the previous has from a young age american children are taught they must suck it up and work through it studies have shown that if a worker is given a generous sick leave not only does the productivity go up but the medical cost goes down because the chances of serious illnesses are reduced workers can afford to stay home when they are sick our students are taught that working ill is what is expected of them and not only is it expected but most schools are tightening the noose and making it harder for the children to take leave when necessary by the time an adult emerges from the school they are used to shaking it off

no marvel fans marvels cinematography isnt amazing its mediocre as fuck pretty colours ≠ good movie,"no this isnt another haha marvel is shit guys look i said marvel is shit im really counterculture please give me upvotes post i enjoy marvel movies  
  
but the amount of marvel fans that i see both on reddit and elsewhere who circlejerk about the amazing cinematography of marvel films and then proceed to show the same 4 colourful stills from guardians or endgame is exhausting especially as a marvel fan myself 
 
listen pretty sparkly rainbow pictures dont automatically make a film artful or cinematically significant this is especially true when your entire business model is about mass producing the same superhero movie 20 times
 
the reality of the matter is that the overwhelming majority of all marvel films are shot in the same cookiecutter manner the framing is acceptable the symbolism of shots is very very heavyhanded at best  oh my god guyz look the 3 good guyz are in the light bit of the sky and the evil baddies are down in the dark bit wif the clouds behind them woaah good symbolism guyz  and a good 99 of the soundtracks are forgettable as all hell marvels movies are fun action flicks and thats totally fine but i see so many people trying to peg each new mcu film as a visionary piece of cinematic art and they really just arent

 
its annoying because its not even like the superhero format invalidates a film as a medium for art like look at into the spiderverse that movie is absolutely pornographic so is the dark knight so is man of steel arguably so is joker but marvel movies sure theyre good films but people need to stop pretending like the mcu is artistically significant or visually exceptional because none of it is in my opinion anyways

people receiving benefits should be prohibited from spending their money on alcohol cigarettes etc,for those who may be confused by the title i live in the uk and as part of our countries social security there is a benefits system in place which essentially allows people who do not have jobs or any form of income to receive money from the government to get by and do not have to pay taxes and all of this money comes from taxes payed by everyone else in the country  i don’t have a huge issue with this system i’m not particularly all for it but i feel that there need to be stricter rules on what people receiving benefits can do with the money they get given if i am paying tax and my government is using some of my tax money to give to people who do not have their own source of income i accept that that money is given to them for them to spend on basic necessities such as food and rent and such and to keep them on their feet until they are able to find themselves a job and begin making their own money i do not agree with this money being given to them only for them to spend it on things such as alcohol or cigarettes because it does not help their situation and encourages them to not seek work and fuel their addictions  me insensitive to their situation but it’s simply not fair on actual taxpayers who are paying for these peoples livelyhoods for the money they are paying to go to pointless substances such as alcohol etc when it is supposed to just keep them on their feet until they are able to support themselves,0,282,1462,101,0.009900990099009901

you cant complain because x person has it worse is a really toxic idea," let me preface this by saying i do believe in being grateful for what you have but theres a difference between that and using this argument to shut people up i hate this for several reasons the people who say this almost never have it worse they are usually putting words in the mouths of another group of people i have a disability that limits my ability to walk i dont complain about it much but ive been told not to because there are other people more disabled than me im aware of that but ive never been told this by someone who wasnt able bodied by the logic of this argument the only people who are allowed to complain are dead or on the verge of death complaining solves problems now i cant speak for everyone with a disability but i personally dont mind if an able bodied person complains about pain as long as they let me do the same in fact im probably the best person you can complain to ive had nerve and muscle pain for a long time and i grew up around lots of healthcare professionals if you have pain i might be able to help  also prevents heart attacks because you let stress out when you complain so even if it doesnt directly solve your problem it lets off steam look it up those people that actually have it worse arent helped by my silence any more than they are by my complaints considering point 3 my complaining might actually help if i do it right after all isnt that what protesting is complaining on your own behalf or on the behalf of others to solve a problem  its used to silence people who need help i dont think i need to explain this part you get it  its human nature to complain it just is  something i had to get off my chest thanks

the problem with dicussion on reddit is that negative karma encourages people to stop debating and go to subreddits that agree with them,negative karma discourages people from arguing against the majority view on a subreddit and instead going to a different subreddit where they are the majority view happens because when you share these unpopular opinions your comments get hidden making it harder for people to listen to what you say especially for new users without much karma it can very easy to get banned and users with unpopular opinions face a very hostile reaction in those subreddits there is an easy alternative where you run to a subreddit which is the complete opposite the majority agrees with you on your statements you have the support of the community and positive reinforcement where people encourage you on is poor for dicussion for many reasons but undoubtedly the most important is that people arent as challenged on their ideas and beliefs drastically lowering the overall quality of discussion would argue that my position is a minority argument and that most redditors would instead put the discussion problem down to the nature of argument on the site being very reactionary with relatively little knowledge on the given subject matter for reading apologies for being unable to spell discussion in the title edit 18hours later i have read all the direct responses thank you so much for contributing everyone especially if you disagree ,0,219,1397,137,0.0072992700729927005

wanting a weapon to protect yourself at home is not weird,"if i do not feel safe at my home and have the desire to arm myself it is completely fine to rely on a gun for protection
here in germany we have a huge antiweapons movement which grows stronger year by year and every time someone goes nuts and shoots people the public outcry against legal gun ownership is huge and i cannot stand this i live in a big city with millions of other people but i do not feel safe anymore it does not matter why it’s not due to the refugees never had problems with them so i did my hunters license and bought a few guns for hunting and protection most of my friends have distanced themselves from me calling me weird and some even calling me a fascist this is not only wrong but really hurtful as well  all i want is some reliable protection and my guns make me feel a lot safer than before do not wish to carry my gun outside my home but i understand people who would like to be allowed to do that
 note gun laws in germany are really strict there are very few ways to obtain a gun legally and every gun has to be registered written down in your owners license and once a year the police comes to your home and checks on the way you store them you need to own a safe and keep all guns locked inside that safe
 since this gets asked so much i have to store my guns in a safe but i’m still able to get them really quickly it’s a „easy access“ safe with a fingerprint lock and of course it only accepts my fingerprint i am allowed to store a full magazine close to my gun so readying up takes something between 2030 seconds 2 i tried to answer as many comments as humanly possible but this got waaaay bigger than i expected so if your questions or criticism remains unanswered i’m very sorry but i cannot keep up",0,343,1810,57,0.07017543859649122

its okay to kick your pregnant teen out of the house,yall wanted some unpopular opinions well come get your juice is for adults you play adult games you get adult prizes children and thus adult responsibilities is not the parent of the teens responsibility to take care of their grandchild that includes housing and utilities food everything a teen parent would get by living at home the parents did not consent to having a new baby in the house also the parents might still be raising their own younger children and do not have the time or energy to have a new baby in the house the teen wants to be pregnant and have the baby then they need to be adults and provide for their own child the teens parents babys grandparents can do fun grandparent things like babysit once a month or buy them fun toys  but its not their responsibility to provide the necessities do think its best if they give the teen a reasonable timeline to move out ex move out before the baby is born or move out before baby turns 3 months old also not saying that the parents absolutely have to make their teen leave if theyre okay with the teen and their baby living there i just get tired of people hating on parents on pregnant teens because they forced the teen to be responsible for the sheltering of their own child rape cases so this doesnt apply to rape cases because the teen didnt choose to have sex while a teen girl would still have the choice to abort or adopt out i do think her parents should a bit more because its not her actions that caused her to be in this situation a raped teen boy cant do much he didnt choose to have sex he doesnt get to choose abortion or adoption 2 teen dad many asked if this treatment only applies to the girl it does not you can kick out the teen dad too i just think the process might be different for the teen dad and his parents because ultimately its up to the teen mom about abortion and adoption 3 i am prosex education and proaccess to abortion when you get pregnant you have 3 choices abortion adoption or parenting consider everything including shelter and finances and make the right choice for you a choice youll have to take responsibility for edit before bed so i removed that landlord line because it turns out i was wrong and think of it in a more unapproved roommate way what i want people to understand is that when a person gets pregnant there are 3 options abortion adoption and parenting each comes with its ups and downs parents of the teens cannot make the decision for them or force them any which way so if the parents cannot force the teen to abortadopt out then the teen is also not entitled to raise their baby at their parents house just because they had chose to have a child young we keep saying that teens are not capable of making adult decisions then why give them the decisions to birth and raise the child if the parents are still responsible for them and their fertility no matter what then the parents would have the ability to make the choice regarding the teens pregnancy but they dont its up to the teen if they want to keep and raise the baby so it is also up to the teen to provide for the baby shelter included  we already have certain pre age18 cases in which teens suddenly become adults certain crimes usually violent ones theyll be tried as adults choosing to become a parent instead of abortion or adoption is another way a teen crosses that threshold imo we let teens drive work babysit and make plenty of other choices we dont monitor them like 2 year olds because they have better decision making skills then that same with sex teen pregnancy is not a failure on the parents and neither is the choice to keep the baby its up to the teen and their choice ,0,691,3853,54,0.018518518518518517
shaming men for being virgins is unhealthy and cruel,yes men because women are rarely shamed for being virgins at any point in life i encourage everyone whos bombarding me in the comments to make your own post about how women are shamed for whatever double standard baffles me its like mens virginity is worthless and should be lost as soon as socially acceptable at an age which gets younger and younger as the years go on it pushes boys to try to sleep with any girl they meet to get their imaginary social sex quota which can lead to harassment and leads virgin men to think theyre undesirable losers and somethings wrong with them men have to decide themselves when theyre ready and when theyve found the right person rather than being pushed by social norms an opinion is different from expecting something to change this will probably never change as much as id like it to,0,149,871,53,0.018867924528301886

what happens off school grounds is not the schools business,"first off i want to name the the only two exceptions 1 school events such as sports as i see these as being an extension of school grounds  2 private schools by nature have the right to refuse business with anyone for any reason other than protected classes so they could terminate schooling for a child that breaks their storeschool policy this means i am talking solely about public schools 
 straight to my main point if a student stays up at night watching tv none of the schools business if a student fights another student at the local walmart parking lot none of the schools business if a student is sitting in the mall tweeting about how much of a  karen is none of the schools business it thats my point now as a concerned organization the school can callemail the legal guardian of the kid to let them know that they feel the behavior deserves attention such as we noticed little johnny is sleepy in class just wanted to let you know he might need a better sleep schedule or a kid showed one of our staff a video of your kid beating up another kid in broad daylight we just thought you should know if applicable they might also report it to athorities as a concerned organization they might offer counseling to victims of violence and torment but  if the crime happened off school property they are in no position to offer any kind of justice well this is taking off first of all rip my inbox it is about 60 disagree 40 agree  do want to add a tid bit i dont have time to restructure my post to be bullet proof against all edge cases i will say this though generally i think the police and judicial system should handle most the issues yall have those systems should not only investigate off campus issues but also prevent them from occuring again in any place especially schools the biggest flaw in my opinion is that this may be impractical to that i say it is worth trying to implement to avoid the countless examples of overreaching schools as posted in the comments by various redditors if your asking how is this unpopular you agree with me but cannot think critically enough to realize that most people disagree all it takes is scrolling through the comments or talking to a few parents",0,409,2307,61,0.01639344262295082

you cannot decide what job would suit you based on what you learn in high school,people often assume that if they excel in a subject they should get a job related to it this is wrong high school subjects are the basics of the basics example if a student sucks at math he or she automatically assumes that heshe shouldnt get a math related job like an economist or an engineer high school math is completely different from math you will use in real life high school math is all about tests and exams you solve problem sets that are designed just for the purpose of making you fail real life though its different for most mathusing jobs its just a tool to get the job done i can name more things that are different but it would take way too much time conclusion planning out your future in high school is the stupidest thing you can possibly do opinions,0,145,818,81,0.08641975308641975

your trigger words are not a stranger’s responsibility,"as respectful human beings we have a personal decency to cater for any preferences in the room it’s common empathy but there’s a highly uncharismatic sense of entitlement to the one who walks into a house and expects every unmet character to know they’re offended by the word “cheesecake” while it’s unfortunate that “cheesecake” makes you feel unsafe or brings you back to a traumatic past no one is accountable for knowing that until they’ve been told the whole point of meeting someone is you explore each other’s qualities’ and acquire knowledge that makes the next encounter more convenient so unless you tailor a varsity bomber jacket that says “cheescake was a dark time” then you can’t berate them for attacking you with the gun they didn’t even know they had can apply to more than trigger words some examples i’ve witnessed are

a dislike button on facebook would actually significantly change the worldfor the better,"the title of this post might seem extreme on the surface but i do believe this to be true the absence of a dislike button on facebook warps public opinions on some serious matters and i believe it also influences peoples own opinions   
 only way to counter a comment you dont agree with or are offended by is to put an angry emoji or comment the angry emoji is misleading and is often used to demonstrate your dislike of the subject at hand and not the comment itself commenting just opens up arguments abuse and takes time giving people a dislike option very much like the down vote system on here would change this  
 being a generally ignorant racist bigoted idiot and commenting something obscene online you might post a comment that really offends 18000 out of 20000 people but it shows 2k likes by like minded idiots this sends out the wrong message this tells people who are just passing that the opinion is popular there is a lack of balance without the effort of commenting and getting involved in a spat add the dislike function and suddenly the comment has 2k likes but 18k dislikes which tells people that this is an unpopular view point and might make people think twice about what they say or take a rain check on their attitudes  
 would give people the freedom to disagree without engaging it would add balance to the site and considering how much political debate there is on there at the moment i think it is important  
 i know its a social media site but we have to take it seriously now it influences people some people live on there facebook impacts the world

the old era of the internet was the golden age and mass popularity social media killed what made the internet magical,"i miss when websites and entire communities were for the community and not for moneyclout if youre anywhere between 2040 right now youve probably experienced a good chunk of the old internet which i would place around 1990s  20052010 
 made it so special was it was never like tvcable holly wood or tabloids it was different it was truly free commercialization and corporate takeover was thought to be unlikely because anyone that was a frequent user was a nerd or geek anonymity was valued because it was never about the individual but rather the actual content of whatever the site was about forums centred around interests without users trying to make a living out of it get internet points or gain clout
 bbs aol usenet and the sort ruled as the means of interacting with others anonymously irc was super interesting with how it developed and broke apart in their wars takeovers and raids on each others networks the old internet was sort of like an anarchy there wasnt much regulation there was so much weird and interesting stuff out there
 old sites from the 90s ahem 18 content which stole everyones innocence hackerculture remember anonymous lulsec which led to real world implications like students hacking school systems bigger organised groups for better or for worse targeting large corporations  the dark net was feared and the ultimate last stage of the internet where the bravest or most insane went to memes lasted years and inside jokes didnt have an expiry date of a week
 first eternal september happened in 1993 and the next major one came in the early 2010s youtube has gone downhill ever since 2012 quality of videos has increased but equally or more so clickbait content and shit youd see on bloody tiktok influencers rule the site making content you expect to see on tiktok 
 facebook was for once college students to connect and hang or whatever not many people used it and those who did werent using it to fish for likesreacts until like 2010 now its the hub of impressionable old folk massive echo chambers misinformation tactics and meme pages who steal memes from each other
 reddit used to be a hub for somewhat serious or at least interesting discussion you were encouraged to think before you post if you used emojis or typed lazily youd be ridiculed it was more akin to a forum than a social media because thats what it is we shat on all the other social media for being stupid then reddit entered a new era catering to the broadest audience possible cracked down on the more interesting and outrageous subs which made reddit different from other sites rwatchpeopledie was the last bastion of that part of reddit subreddits that enticed interesting discussions like raskreddit rshowerthoughts or even rtifu became grounds for sexy sex time posts and oneliners the site isnt so bad but the majority of the content on rall is shit you see on facebook twitter or any other social media site what made reddit special was that it was different content was never centred on politics loweffort reposts influencersyoutuberscelebrities or rfunny type shit it was diverse but not that stupid
 anonymity was always important in the old internet privacy nowadays is practically dead for the majority no one gives a shit about their privacy and they willingly gave it away in exchange for convenience its stupid easy to dox anyone on the internet now i remember it being actually impressive when someone was able to track your real name etc because that was something youd actively try to hide
 big corporations didnt integrate themselves onto the internet and try to monetize everything in my opinion the biggest appeal of the internet was that it was different there was always something to discover and it was community driven
 dont dislike the nowadays era of the internet but there are things i certainly miss about the old
 woah this blew up ill read everyones responses for tea 
 some thoughts and hopefully the final edit 
 its fascinating to hear your experiences of the old era whether we agreed or not this is the type of shit i want to see an actual discussion
 as i was writing it and before i hit post i did feel i mightve been too harsh sounding as if i dont appreciate what we have today

social media was a fucking mistake,humans were better off without social media with the advent of the internet it was inevitable but we have definitely lost something good and replaced it with the most toxic shit you can think of  day on multiple facebook posts i see people even family members treat each other like shit over either something political or things that don’t even matter all over what fake internet points twitter is worse and instagram is just mindless humans turn into a disgusting pack of mongrels when they log onto their social media accounts maybe it just shows cowardice above anything else you don’t see many people talk like that to each other’s face seemed like for a while there in the 90’s and early 2000’s we were doing alright  racerelated hate was on the decline people seemed to get along better a thousand other examples i suppose social media only served to bring negative feelings that were already there to light but is that necessarily a good thing absolutely not  social media has been a helpful tool for many people and for many purposes but all of that comes at the cost of risking our relationships with others and that is far too steep a price i’ll be honest i’m fucking afraid to even post to my facebook wall anymore i love my family much more than my opinions and i would hate to go down that route all forms of social media shut down tomorrow there’d be butthurt for some time but i guarantee the world would become a better place holy fuck this blew up way more than i expected it too also to whomever gave me gold thank you very much i really appreciate the gesture,0,290,1645,35,0.02857142857142857

unpopular for cannabis users i think weed culture is awful,"i use cannabis everyday i would be considered a stoner by most people weed culture is childish cringy and counterproductive to the destigmatization of this wonderful drug i would rather kick myself in the balls than own anything with a cannabis leaf drawn on it wether its shirt a hat an ashtray a rolling tray a poster a tattoo a bong or a fucking sticker people whose apparent jobs are to smoke weed on youtube make me sick and if you look at recipes for edibles they will invade your reccomended videos

 i went to a legal shop here in montreal and left slmost immediately due to the overwhelming douche baggery happening in there they turned bob marley a man who sang songs of love and unity and turned him into a mass marketed caricature who seemed to have only cared about weed every mention of 420 makes me roll my eyes if anything canadians should celebrate 1017 the day cannabis was legalized federally and dealers in general are insufferable weed snobs

 every dealer i have had until my current suppliers have been arrogant douchebags who try and tell you you are smoking wrong and think they are your friends i know its shitty to bag on how people enjoy things but weed culture makes all cannabis users looks immature lazy and stupid 1 this opinion is way more popular than i thought i should be getting downvotes 2 thank you everyone so very much for the gifts silver and platinnum and support this is my first popular post and i did not expect it to blow up like this i dont want to seem like a spoiled brat about the upvotes and gifts but in order to maintain the integrity of this subreddit you must downvote me if you think this is popular thanks for reading",0,307,1731,61,0.03278688524590164
the real “alpha” males tend to be respectful and chill people it’s the guys with insecurities and problems trying to be “alpha” who are assholes,"growing up i was in a position where i was always going through some sort of adversity whether it be family school illness ect and there were days where i wasn’t putting my 100 game face and attitufe outside the house  notice that my acquaintances and friends who tend to be very accomplished people and are the epitome of the successful man tended to be some of the realest and most genuine people around me for example the traits they shared would be athletic accomplishments in sports lifting strong career and academic goals involvement in clubs and student activities both in hs and college traveling open mindedness self created good appearance due to taking care of self and clothing and humblepositive personalities i’ve had lab mates who went to oxford and harvard who i wouldn’t have even suspected gone to such schools because when you talk to them  they wanted to know about you and really laid back people you know they’re awesome people from just the way they carry themselves had former friends and acquaintances who were the opposite for example one example of a former close i had was somebody who barely got through high school and participated in nothing back then after he would be extremely stubborn about getting a job going to a job training program or putting himself in positions to meet new people ect his ass was just sitting around broke and always creating drama with other people while mooching off others he did not work out much yet bragged constantly about his childhood accomplishments claiming to have played 10 different sports he always talked about being alpha and tried to act like the top dog around others people initially are drawn to his charm and good social skills but over time they see the truth that he’s just a total loser in the neighborhood i grew up with there were a lot of people like the one guy i described above

accused rapists should have the same anonymity as rape victims until proven guilty,with the difficulty in proving rape cases due to evidence being largely testimonial many accused rapists are judged in the public eye rather than the courts as the basis of the law is innocent until proven guilty and lived can be ruined based upon false accusations defendants should remain nameless unless its in the public interest  accused brings few benefits besides other victimswitnesses potentially coming forward and warning the public while the trial is under way obviously due to the nature of the crime each cases is different and exceptions will apply however with many details of trials hidden the general public tends to make their decision if the accused is guilty based upon very little evidence this can essentially amount to mob rule even if they are eventually proven innocent reputations can be irreparable ,0,137,848,83,0.012048192771084338
the guy who left his girlfriend because he found she got gangbanged before being together was absolutely justified,"this image was making the rounds a few months ago a screenshot of a 4chan thread where the guy said he broke up with his girlfriend of 4 years after he found out she participated in a gangbang and admitted she loved it the image went viral in a lot of fb pages and a bunch of people were in outrage about how the mysognist broke the girls heart people have a mindset where there is no middle ground ever its all black or white  with this mindset these people started calling him mysoginist because apparently hes a hypocrite he probably had sex with a lot of girls too lol he wanted a virgin as if having sex with 4  people was the same as having sex with 4 people at the same time
a lot were also saying that lol well he must be really boring in bed probably only does missionary why keep a man like that again as if not wanting to participate in a gangbang means that you only have sex in missionary position was justified a gangbang is easily an extreme in terms of sexual acts and for a lot of people it can be a sign that you either have really poor restrain judgment skills and that youre potentially more likely to cheat the guy isnt a prude for not liking the idea of his girlfriend riding 4 cocks at once and neither does it indicates that he only enjoys the most vanilla of sex just another case of if its not black its white mindset",0,263,1403,115,0.008695652173913044

american football is overly hyped and boring,"the average football game lasts 3 hours with an average of just 11 minutes of actual play i am thoroughly confused as to how this is the most popular sport in the us i realize that there is a history and a past culture of football in america which i think is a big factor as to why it’s so popular i also recognize the skill amp speed needed to be good at the sport and while i do enjoy playing it i can’t bear to watch it even when there is action and someone makes a sick play flag doesnt count  it with other “freeflowing” sports such as hockey soccer amp basketball which have minimal stoppages compared to amount of gameplay and i’m baffled as to how more people aren’t into these sports sure soccer can be boring at times basketball can be repetitive however i’ll take repetition over lack of actual play  tried to get into football this past year and while fantasy is incredibly fun in the sense of having a stake in the game i just cant sit there and watch drives that consist of 56 plays over 10 minutes with nobody scoring most of the time maybe i’m biased in the sense that other sports have actual goals that you need to put an object into whereas football’s goal is just trying to run or throw a ball into a specific zone on the field i do think the hitting is fun to watch but take a sport like hockey people give it so much shit but in my opinion it takes the more skill than most sports you have grown men fighting over a 3 inch disk while traveling upwards of 20 mph on a metal blade you need the ability to shoot over 85 mph and thread the needle its gritty fast paced exciting and talent driven it requires a vast amount of teamwork awareness and tactics i feel like most sports fans who don’t enjoy these sports also don’t appreciate the art of them and a really wish more did that is all 
 i just realized this exact opinion was posted 2 days ago and has probably been posted a million times in this subreddit sorry 2 for all those saying “soccer is more boring” i agree at times and i literally said that in the post the point of this post was that if i’m going to invest 3 hours in watching a game 11 minutes of gameplay is unacceptable between the constant ads and replays it is simply unwatchable soccer may be boring but at least you get what you pay for you get to watch the sport you signed up to watch also a lot of you need to recheck which sub you’re on because this is my opinion its ok for us not to like the same things 3 the amount of people commenting about how the band “american football” is amazing and i’m wrong please read the post 4 yeah yeah game of chess yada yada yada a lot of you must really love watching chess if thats your argument",0,526,2770,44,0.045454545454545456

hunting for food if done right is perfectly ethical and there is nothing wrong with hunting down and killing an animal,"my uncle takes me hunting sometimes and i love it the thrill of shooting an elk and then eating its meat is amazing some people say its wrong and unethical but i completely disagree heres why the animal unless a predator probably would have gotten mauled and killed by some other predator such as a wolf or bear if you had not shot it
when you shoot an animal such as a buck if you hit it right it will be dead within a couple minutes or seconds sometimes the adrenaline it gets causes it to feel no pain compare that to it being mauled to death by some other animal and honestly being shot by a hunter isnt that bad only hunt for grown males not females or children if you kill a child animal youve cut its life way shorter than it should have been and it doesnt even supply that much meat if you kill a female youve just cut down the species from repopulating by a little bit and that female couldve potentially had kids nearby that now have to survive without a mother pretty fucked up and unethical only shoot grown males hunting provides food  dont hunt for sport thats just a huge dick move hunting is for providing food for yourselfyour family a deer will have enough meat to last a very long time and its natural nobody fed that animal drugs to fatten it up if you have never tried natural animal meet hunted from the woods as opposed to steak you buy from the store which has been farmed from a cow who they probably fed a bunch of drugs to fatten it up than you need to try it asap  is honestly way healthier and more ethical than what the big corporation farmers feed you",0,305,1660,120,0.008333333333333333

reading your childs texts is a gross invasion of privacy,dont get me wrong if i am a parent and im seriously suspicious that my child is doing something that could endanger themselves or others looking through their phone is obviously an option that makes sense to get the answers you need parents who flip their shit at teenagers for simply not telling them something or perhaps just not being entirely truthful and punish them by taking away their phone and reading all their private conversations is just crazy to me i feel like age should play a factor in this conversation as well  if your child is say 15 years old chances are they probably have some conversations they dont want you to know  sometimes people are afraid to tell their parents something so they find asylum in a friend and vise versa  perhaps they had some experience that they would rather not share with you  there is literally an abundance of reasons why a teenager might not want their parents to go through their texts  not to mention the fact that constantly looming that threat over your child just leads them to lie more and be way more secretive also hate the mantra of its my child its my business  are you trying to develop a strong independent young adult or are you just trying to hold onto that feeling of superiority from their childhood you so desperately dont want to let go pisses me off the most however is how parents seem to lack empathy from their high school years  most of the boomers who are now parents of high schoolcollege kids didnt have text growing up  it would be the equivalent of having your mom bug your room when you have friends over after school  having your mom listen to all the times you talked about boys and who likes who and in more dire situations who needs help  i just cant imagine growing up and having a totally normal high school experience and then thinking to yourself you know what would have made my high school life easier if i just had no privacy  i feel like the point of parenting is to raise your kid better than you were raised and this completely negates that logic to mention the fact that a conversation takes two to tango  youre not just invading your childs privacy which i suppose you have jurisdiction over you are invading the privacy of whoever was talking to your child  this not only is incredibly shitty for the other person but also discourages them from wanting to remain in contact with your child out of fear that their messages could be used against them  and nobody wants their kid to have no friends to talk to yes i am aware that most high school parents are probably gen x and not boomer that shouldnt effect my point though  also people are asking my age  i dont think it particularly matters id rather have my argument critiqued on its actual merit  not to mention anyone who has been a kid can have an opinion on this issue given they make up half of the entire relationship in question,0,543,2993,58,0.017241379310344827

america is becoming a place not run by laws but by those who complain the loudest,it seems like many politicians health officials businesses and people of influence are easily influenced and swayed by “mass public opinion” it feels like america is becoming a place where if you can scream the loudest and get people to agree with you you can really get anything you want done now a place that’s supposed to work with checks and balances and laws and ideas and research and debates it seems like a recipe for disaster for some many leaders to succumb to public pressure all the time the public opinion always changes and the public never really “knows” what they want sounds like a recipe for disaster mass i don’t necessarily mean majority why do we do large quick changes in opinion or structure without any regard to potential consequences because groups of people are angry i’m trying to say continued emotionally fueled anger and mobs towards whatever the mobs don’t like or disagree with and leaders quickly and constantly succumbing to demands is going to lead to disaster especially in an age where misinformation is rampant a little reminder it’s not just about politics i’m also talking about businesses people of influence and other groups besides politics where  people succumb to the mob pressure not talking about democracy i’m talking about mobocracy or ochlocracy,0,218,1328,81,0.012345679012345678

unattractive people should learn to accept that they’re not attractive rather than delude themselves that they are,"“everybody is beautiful to somebody”  doesn’t exist”  is equally attractive in their own way”  don’t even matter what’s on the inside determines whether you’re attractive or not” perfect just the way you are” 
 quotes amongst many others are constantly fed to unattractive people it’s like everyone needs to believe they’re attractive or else god forbid anyone ever see themselves as lessthanbeautiful  why is being unattractive that bad is attractiveness a person’s only value to humanity are the lies necessary in a utopia everybody would be attractive to everybody and no one would be considered ugly but alas this is planet earth and life isn’t fair some people are born with attractive features some are not some are born with blatantly unattractive features yes that’s nobody’s fault but that’s just the way it is  you say “beauty is subjective” you can’t deny that certain features are innately and universally attractive to human beings for men they would be tall height broad shoulders full hair clear skin and facial symmetryharmony for women clear skin full hair hairlessness facial symmetryharmony and a good waisthip ratio aside from certain fetishists i’ve yet to meet a man or woman who did not strongly prefer these features and dislike their opposites  only would people stop lying to themselves if they accepted their unattractiveness they would no longer have to wonder “what am i doing wrong” when they find that others don’t view them how they view themselves",0,248,1597,115,0.008695652173913044

applying modern morality to historical figures is the dumbest way to acknowledge history,no this post is not about slave owners or any single group necessarily owning slaves was frowned upon when we did it and even 80 years before the civil war during the founding of the us can’t stand people who think that their understanding of morals and ethics is the universal objective and that everyone else who’s practically ever lived was wrong to not acknowledge the time and location where a particular act took place is to be willfully ignorant for your own benefit  get that when arguing this specific part of historical analysis people have an agenda and need to defend their reasoning by insinuating that moral relativism is just a theory and that we as a perfect human race in all our wisdom can look back on our ancestors and judge their actions from a place of higher being while also not having any idea what their lives were  just such a pretentious and unproductive way of debating history hey guys just wanted to add a couple things to specify and also i want to thank everyone for participating as i think this is a discussion that we need to have over and over again to stay cognizant of how we approach history and the people we choose to venerate that said a lot of questions here were about giving specific examples i’d like to point to genghis khan who we almost universally refer to as a genocidal rapist at this point however he built the mongolian empire out of the scattered and poor steppe tribes that various empires and the chin dynasty has been subjugating for years the tribes would be turned on each other into major wars to keep them weak and docile and life was hard for every mongolian genghis khan’s story of how he rose to power is amazing you should read it sometime but basically he was just tired of being stepped on by everyone else and many mongols felt the same this caused them to unite the tribes rise up and overthrow pretty much the entire eastern world at the time to a mongolian the khan would have been considered a grassroots leader with conviction who fought the uberwealthy chin overlords and made mongolia the center of power in asia he’s be referred to as a god and is still viewed locally in a similar manner but to us in the west we see our own historical record which heavily criticized the mongols for being pagan and an unstoppable force of genocidal maniacs i’m not saying they weren’t but i certainly don’t think we can explain genghis khan’s actions and rationale as “he was pure evil” or “he was a psychopath” because that ignores the almost infinite nuances that made him do everything he did ignoring those nuances means that what we’re learning about him and consequently ourselves is inherently flawed and we need to overcome that by acknowledging our own biases i’m not saying you can’t view historical actions with your own morals but you do need to acknowledge that doing so creates a false narrative that can be dangerous to go with my earlier example if someone just assumes that genghis khan was pure evil because of all the things he did and uses that to judge him against modern morals that person ignores the actual events that caused him to do such reprehensible things these events could have caused anyone to do exactly what the khan did basically it’s not enough to understand the end result we need to know how we got there first how did regular people in germany at the beginning of ww2 get drawn into nazism we know how it ended but how it started is often glossed over and we lose the reasons why something happened and only promise ourselves that we won’t do that thing again that’s a tough sell for me,0,651,3678,88,0.011363636363636364

your average joe doesnt have to reduce his carbon footprint and aid against climate change until big corporations and governments start trying,pretty much the average persons attempts to minimize their effect on climate change is a very valiant cause but will do nothing in the longrun until corporations and governments own up to their shortcomings and do something about it governments burning fossil fuels and corporations dumping trash into the oceans and not doing anything to reduce their carbon footprints is going to be the last straw for humans if we continue like this then climate change is in my opinion going to be the one that kills a majority of the population the quote a chain is only as strong as its weakest link really applies here its great that people do their bit in helping but until governments and companies do something the world will continue in the downward spiral that its on until governments start use renewable energy instead of coal or corporations reduce their carbon footprint you or i dont have to do anything because our small contribution wont really change anything a person taking a shorter shower and riding a bike is for a great cause and should be supported but it means close to nothing big businesses and governments have to own up and need to make huge efforts to remedy climate change so i see a lot of people saying that the average joes job is to vote for candidates that have a policy like that i absolutely agree you guys have actually changed my opinion a little but i still think that it should be the governmentpotential candidate and corporations that take the initiative i know that is a bit of wishful thinking because thats putting a lot of faith in people where this isnt a priority but the initiative is really key here in my opinion,0,294,1699,144,0.013888888888888888

the sexual nature of music and music videos is just disgusting,most songs i hearsee everyday are all about either about thinking about sex doing the sex the size of genitals or backsides and it is so disappointingly revolting when you thought that a song you may have like has a bad sexual music video like call on me for example or when a sexual song has such a good music video talk dirty to me comes to mind main reasons i hate the whole sexualisation of people in music is that those innuendos used are so either really blatantly obvious making the music andor videos puke enducingly enough to make it like porn in a way or really sneaky so that people who dont get the innuendo may play the song while kids are around planting the idea that you should sexualize people or just ruining there maybe favourite song when they develop a twisted mind for when they get the innuendos happened to me with cake by the ocean floor hate sexing due to it either being soft core porn or planting the seed of sexualizing people into kids,0,180,999,63,0.015873015873015872

toxic femininity is worse than toxic masculinity,"in recent years we have seen a rise in complaints relating to the behaviour of men and how it can be construed as toxic the current movements have brought a deeper focus towards this and have created changes some for the better and some for the worse but during this time the very people marching against man have completely ignored their own toxic behaviours and a failure to address these would be worry some women seem to want equality but do not want to change their own bad behaviours you think of toxic masculinity you are primarily speaking about mansplaining manspreading sexual violence or the boys will be boys argument the whole movements seems to target the role of men as the dominant sex when you look at toxic femininity there is a much wider scope of problems that show up a lot of toxic behaviours can easily outweigh most of what these people consider to be toxic masculinity a few examples being blaming behavioural issues on periods
 acting helpless at times where some physically demanding or unpleasant task comes up
 coercing men into sex who didnt seem to really want it and feeling as though you were at liberty to do so because men always want it
 backed up by studies women are far more likely to threaten harm to themselves others or property if a man attempts to leave a relationship
 being physically abusive to men while expressing men cant hit women and being less likely to face any legal consequences for doing so
 lying about pregnancies or being on birth control to see how a man would respond or to manipulate them into staying
 manipulating divorce and custody battles by falsely insisting that a man has been abusive to you or a child of these examples are minor toxic offences like blaming bad behaviour on hormones its normal it happens but it is no excuse all the same some of these examples are major toxic offences such as using your gender or children as a weapon to influence decision to go your way of the most common offences of toxic femininity is attempting to convince the world that toxic femininity does not exist thanks for the constructive discussions happening instead of comment bashing",0,376,2243,48,0.08333333333333333

if your girlfriend refuses to do something sexually with you that she has willingly done for her previous boyfriends you should break up with her,"for the record im not talking about things she tried once with an ex but never did again because she genuinely didnt like it although an argument could be made for her letting you try at least once too i am talking about is any act she willingly performed for an ex that she either enjoyed or was at least indifferent to ie she had no negative feelings about it are two main reasons for this behavior and neither of them are good first reason could be that her ex is more important to her than you he is so important that even though the relationship is over there are still things that she wants to reserve as only being for him and in her mind giving those things to you would feel like cheating i know crazy right second reason could be that she is less attracted to you than she was to her ex you are second best in her estimation good enough to date but not good enough to give all that she has to offer does that sound like a desirable relationship to be in reddit is filled with easily triggered women and the whitest of knights who have this magical ability to read things that were never typed so lets make some things clear no guy is entitled to sex from a girl just because she is his girlfriend but no girl is entitled to a relationship with a guy she wont fuck
2 im not saying that a guy should say do this for me or im leaving im saying that once he finds out that shes holding out on him sexually he should move on that relationship is toxic and you can be sure that sex isnt the only thing shes keeping from him
3 this obviously goes both ways and pertains to more things than just sex i only picked men and sex because i tend to hear about that situation more often
4 obviously not suggesting that the girl should be forced to do anything she doesnt want to do

telling men to not be afraid of a false rape accusation because its statistically unlikely doesnt help anything because thats not why we are really afraid,anyone who pays attention to the news at all should remember the cluster fuck that was the kavanaugh hearings resulting from that mess was the brief conversation that happened around the interwebs on the opinion pages of news sites and probably a good amount of interpersonal conversations as well  conversation went as such if youre afraid of a false rape accusation landing on you youre wrong to do so because its so rare and youre a shitty person to do so because that means you dont care about women furthermore even men who are falsely accused of rape rarely see jail time anyways no shit the reason being is that the biggest way to determine if an accusation is false is if there is undeniable evidence despite the accuser stating otherwise which is rare or the accuser confesses that the accusation was false which is usually the case so of course the legal system will not give charges based on a certifiable false statement  isnt outlined about rape accusations is the majority of them are closed because there is no evidence to support either scenario the implication in providing the theyre really rare statistic was it implied the remaining allegations were true in effect it was a lie by omission  the above really isnt my point anyways heres the main point a false accusation the false accuser is rarely punished there are very little if any repercussions to a false female rape accuser if shes found to be lying why should a woman be scared to make a false allegation if his life is going to be fucked up from it and hers isnt even if shes caught in the lie wheres the deterrent there  question that i have never once seen given a good answer does a man prove verbal unrecorded consent to sex this is how most consent occurs anyways other than his word what defense does he have to a woman stating that the sex turned into rape throw in radical feminisms insistence that consent can be revoked at any time even after sex then what men are looking at is a fucking legal minefield that has this as a sign at the front of it intimacy with a woman  have no defense she gets no consequences and people are baffled as to why men especially young men are terrified of this  i want to be wrong  what you can do if i am treat me as someone who has been lied to and prove why thats the case without being a piece of shit about it try and see if you can avoid calling me an incel as that is the current insult in this regard ive found  not saying this to guard against my delicate sensibilities but rather know that i am nowhere close to being alone here relentless condescension namecalling and accusations are only going to do one thing with the growing number of men who are convinced theyre right itll reinforce their position and you wont even see them in the comments you wont even see them outside the walls of a public conversation or a heated exchange on facebook talk to them not me in this case here on reddit at least   if i am wrong convince the people not leaving comments the ones listening that i am and see if you can do it in a way that doesnt make you look like part of another growing demographic someone who doesnt even give a shit and could care less about mens concerns and fears holy shit this exploded thank you everyone so it looks like i have some work to do and i will endeavor to answer comments and questions where appropriate today ,0,633,3640,159,0.025157232704402517

it’s not rude to recline your seat on an airplane,i f28 recently came back from a trip which was a 8 hour nonstop flight after ascending i reclined my chair soon after i heard a woman seated in the row behind me mention that i had some nerve to be so inconsiderate i paid them no mind as it only goes back 2 goddamn inches and fell asleep i was only asleep for 45 mins when i woke up to someone repeating “excuse me ma’am” in my ear it was the flight attendant asking me if i could lift my seat back up now i became irritated because i hate being woken up especially for some bs so i said “why am i doing something wrong” she responded “no it’s just that the ladies behind you are uncomfortable”  seats were in the front of the plane which was completely full but i knew there were plenty of empty seats further back i paid extra for the aisle and to have a seat closer to the exit to make getting off quicker i responded with “sorry i can’t because then i would be uncomfortable but if they want more space than you could have them move seats in the back” the daughter chimes in right away “no we’re not moving my mother is elderly and doesn’t need your seat in her personal space you have no excuse you’re young and healthy”  didn’t even bother to talk to her instead spoke directly to the flight attendant “look i’m not starting any trouble i’ve had spinal surgery for a herniated disc and have screw in my hip resulting from a car accident a flight this long causes pain in my lower back and my hip becomes stiff the reclining helps relieve some of the pressure the gentleman in front of me has his seat back but i’m not complaining because airplane rides are never comfortable even if i was young and healthy i wouldn’t be doing anything i’m not supposed to so please don’t wake me up again”  flight attendant apologized to me and told the women there was nothing wrong with what i was doing but she tried to mediate then walked off i looked at the entitled lady who was mouthing off who wasn’t even sitting behind me and said “anything else you got an issue with” she scoffed and rolled her eyes i was proud of myself because 2 years ago i would’ve caused a scene that would’ve ended up viral then i went back to sleep and had a peaceful flight  karens 🙄,0,429,2264,49,0.02040816326530612
if a girls reason for being part of competitions it to represent women then you lose my support,"dont get me wrong im intrigued when competitions that have a larger male base of contenders have a woman participate as well 
when you see the short minute interviews and etc you expect a reason to why these people participate

teaching your child how to fight is the only way to stop persistent bullying,school policies on antibullying measures are an absolute laughable joke parents who leave it up to the school to deal with bullying or insist their child tell the school are better off telling their child they will continue to be tormented to hell speaking to the parents will generally make things worse and telling your child to ignore it is just as effective as doing nothing  it is wrestling boxing bjj it doesnt matter as long as it its applicable an adult with fighting experience would demolish an adult without fighting experience if you have fighting experience as a child you will be untouchable  personal experience i used to be picked on for reasons that now seem illogical other than kids are mindless in the harm they cause i was put into wrestling and boxing by force by my father and while i was scared shitless attempting to retaliate it worked tremendously well even without much experience the bullying stopped and the worst part was the bully attempted to befriend me for years after the incident,0,178,1052,76,0.013157894736842105

the fact that her milkshake brings all the boys to the yard does not mean its better than mine,in the song titled milkshake by kelis she exclaims how all the boys show up in her yard for milkshakes which claim to be better than mine not only is this self entitlement but she doesnt give any valid reasons as to why her milkshakes are better according to the lyrics of this boastful chant she is willing to offer lessons for making such a milkshake but for a price could that mean that the ingredients used to make this milkshake cost more than the labelled price and instead of increasing it to maintain profit she gives lessons on how to make such a milkshake in order to compensate for her lack of total earnings is she that desperate to keep the all the boys in her yard a low price in exchange for a higher consumer rate and yet she claims that her milkshakes are better than mine what if she were to increase the prices will all the boys still head to the yard cause the milkshake is that good she even says that her milkshake making techniques drive the guys crazy and freak these boys its unbelievable how ones milkshakes can be judged simply by how its prepared i highly believe that my milkshakes are capable of bringing all the people to the yard with hard work and reasonable prices im assured that one day i will be capable of creating ultimate milkshake which brings not only boys but also girls to my yard let not one sex judge and conclude without having to hear from the other and from there it will bring equality and fairness into this competition of milkshakes with that i conclude that her milkshakes are not better than mine just because it brings all the boys to the yard,0,297,1635,96,0.041666666666666664

the word “retarded” shouldn’t be offensive,"the fact that society is shying away from “the rword” is proof of the socalled euphemism treadmill basically by replacing “retarded” with something else we’re just kicking the can down the road and it’s a matter of time before the new word becomes offensive  that long ago the term “retarded” was considered a kind and politically correct way to replace words like “idiot” and “imbecile” those were actually medical terms 75 or so years ago  term “special” or “special needs” is probably the most common way of replacing “retarded” but even those terms are becoming offensive for example conservatives sometimes derisively call progressives “special snowflakes”  human decency should prevent us from making fun of those with mental disabilities but it just isn’t necessary to tiptoe around those clunky terms that become offensive after a few years

teachers who stop class to embarrass kids really need to reconsider their maturity,ive seen this happen in class and ive experienced it a student will do something that doesnt disrupt the class but annoys the teacher so the teacher will stop class for a good 5 minutes to embarrass the student  so counterproductive it doesnt do anything but actually disrupt class it doesnt teach the students any life lesson and it makes the student being embarrassed dislike the teacher more than they probably already had makes it clear to any adult that the teacher has selfesteemmaturity issues outside of class and bullies their students to make themselves feel good its not right and it deserves some kind of reprimand or punishment im not saying punishment is a bad thing im saying embarrassment can ruin a students motivation to do well and it should not be used as a form of punishment if a student is doing something wrong its okay to tell them to stop whats not okay is dragging it on long enough to disrupt class for a good chunk of time effectively drawing attention to the student for that long while the teacher just rants instead of offering criticism which should be done out of class i get that teachers are human but i dont think its unfair to expect exceptional maturity from them when their job is to deal with kids,0,223,1293,82,0.012195121951219513
